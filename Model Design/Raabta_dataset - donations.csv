It's been a goal of mine to get my long time friends and partners better PCs.  
We live in different countries and gaming together was the way we initially connected (with each other and our extended friend group) and is still one of our main sources of group entertainment.   
Their current PCs are old Dells from the 90s running intel graphics however and struggle with anything but the simplest of games (default minecraft with the graphics down runs, dark souls runs at about 10fps, etc)   
Life always manages to get in the way of being able to upgrade however and whilst they don't like asking for money, I will absolutely ask for them!   


I've put together builds for budgets PCs that would run about $300 for each PC with room to upgrade.

I finally got them to create a money pool so I could help by donating a bit at a time (set to $1200 but that is just a generous ceiling for GPU and all, $600 is closer to accurate) and would be eternally grateful to anyone who wishes to help, with however much they wish to spare!

(Weekly payments needed this place sucks its a long story) in the past we’ve come close but family managed to help us but this time we’ve been told they aren’t going to help us and I’ve frantically tried everything at this point. Selling all my possessions anything of value, doing lewd things for extra bits of cash but I’ve only managed to scrape up like 30$ on top of the leftover cash from our last pay period last Friday. And that’s only like 50$ (last I checked however bf might have used some for gas today) and we owe 279$ for the week. I have a few odds and ends to sell so I’m willing to not just take free money but please help me out. I don’t want to even think about what happens if this place kicks us out. I have kids. I’m freaking out. My bf works full time (and a second place) I watch our children and sell on eBay but my business has really tanked as of late it’s really not doing well. In fact fees are hurting me and I may just close the account. 

I’ve applied to jobs even fast food at this point but daycare is an issue as my family wants nothing to do with my bf or his sons we would have been just fine as expected until we got our electric bill and it really fucked us bad I don’t know what else to do I’ve written here before in times of panic before friends had helped me out but they’re hands are tied too so I really am stuck

Literally anything would help even a dollar I swear to god. I can show bills, I’ll surely get a notice today for rent (landlady is quick to post them) I’ll show that, and if you are interested in the items I can afford to sell pls dm me if not, I offer other things and if you can’t afford to help I 100% understand that just please I ask you to share this or spread the word I can even draw anime like stuff I’m not very good but anything for compensation Nothing is too far fetched at this point I really am desperate mY HAIR IS TURNING WHITE IM ONLY 25 WTF"

15,medical,"WARNING: KIND OF GROSS PICTURE.

&#x200B;

Okay, so. I have some pretty weird teeth because I had a lot of high fevers as a kid, and in the last few years I've had a couple of teeth just . . . hollow themselves out. No apparent cavities or anything (although I have plenty of those elsewhere, my teeth are crap in spite of regular brushing and my funds are low), they just go hollow.

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago I noticed this weird swelling on my gum. But it didn't hurt, and this being December and me working in the service sector, I sort of went ""I should get that looked at"" and forgot all about it.

&#x200B;

I woke up this morning and that swelling is very, very angry about being forgotten. It's doubled in size, it's centered right over one of those hollow teeth, it's *throbbing* and the gum around the tooth is bright red. I've had to do this before: it's an infection and the course of action will be ""dental visit, 'we can't save this tooth,' antibiotics, another visit, pull it.""

&#x200B;

Even through the cheap dentist in my town that's going to be around $450: three hundred to pull the tooth (*I'm not joking it's fucking ridiculous*), $60 each for dental visits, and about twenty bucks for the antibiotics.

&#x200B;

In the past, I've always been able to pull money from *somewhere* when one of my teeth decides to go rogue. But because it's year-end/year-start, my final 2019 paycheck was out-of-cycle and constituted one week's pay that has to last three weeks instead of my usual ""two weeks' work for two weeks' pay"". Once I paid phone and rent, that was all gone, and I don't get paid again til the 21st.

&#x200B;

If some guardian angel wants to throw the whole $450 at me I certainly wouldn't say no, but right now my main concern is eighty dollars: enough to get in, get meds, and get this infection down. I'm running through PayPal because GoFundMe says it takes up to a week to get funds and I literally cannot wait a week (if the infection got that much bigger that fast, its next stop will be my sinuses), so I can be found at [technicolor\_nina@yahoo.com](mailto:technicolor_nina@yahoo.com), BUT . . .

&#x200B;

If you want proof, here's a (gross, sorry) picture. You can see the hollow tooth third back, with the broken bottom. That weird gray/black quality isn't cavity--it's literally a lack of tooth innards. I had to get the camera too close to my mouth to do the traditional ""paper with my reddit name on it"" thing, but you can pop the image into Google search, nothing else will come up.

Winter has arrived in Greece, temperatures have dropped drastically and it has been raining for days on end. There are currently more than 7500 people living in the hotspot on Samos, the southern-most Aegean island, in a camp which is build to only host 648 people. This means the numbers of people have DOUBLED within the last 10 months and the camp is more than 11 times over capacity.  Most of these 7500 people are sleeping in tents and makeshift shelters which provide no protection against the cold or wet. For us, this means  even more people are coming to seek some warmth in our community centre, shelter from the rain, a hot cup of tea, an hour away from the  conditions in the camp, away from the rain and cold. 

We are running the biggest community centre on the island, and our doors are open six days a week for everyone who wants to come. We teach  an unbelievable 120 classes weekly - 19 daily language classes, alongside art, fitness or music practice - and we offer activities for children and women. We also run the only laundry station on the island, offering some basic hygiene for people living in muddy and wet tents. With the increased number of people and the terrible living conditions the needs are getting bigger and bigger - but our resources are scarce. 

Samos Volunteers relies 100% on donations. This winter, we urgently need your support to be able to maintain our activities during the next months to keep our lights on, our tea warm and our classes running.

 The Children’s Museum in West Hartford, Connecticut offers hands-on fun with science and nature for younger children and families, school and community groups, and home schooled children. At the Museum and in classrooms throughout Connecticut and New England,  we encourage children to become creative thinkers and lifelong learners. Children engage in our interactive labs, workshops, multi-sensory exhibits and demonstrations, a live wildlife sanctuary, state-of-the art digital science dome planetarium shows and movies. Our unique Children’s Museum Preschool, co-located on our West Hartford campus, integrates science experiences into early childhood learning. Nearby Roaring Brook Nature Center in Canton offers environmental exhibits, nature programs, concerts and acres of outdoor hiking, and bird watching.

We serve under represented children and families, bringing quality education to communities that might not have access to this curriculum.  We house over 300 injured/sick/abandoned animals, and rehabilitate and release 900 animals per year back into the wild . We need help to end the year strong so we can continue our mission. Every donation is tax deductible and if you get one in before 12/31,  you get a tax deduction for next year!

Thank you for any and all support!"

I have been talking to him for more than six months now but I haven’t met in person. He’s really helped me with my mental health and personal struggles, more than anyone I’ve met in real life. Its funny how I was able to fall in love with someone I haven’t touched or smelled or been with.  

I’m from Toronto and he’s from Florida. I’m a university student barely making it by as it is, so any help would be appreciated. 

I hope you’re all having a good holiday."
54,pets,"Hello reddit,
Normally I don't ask for favours but I really need your guys' help. My sister and I adopted a 3,5 month old cat, turned out she has a broken leg. She needs a surgery and it's a cost of around 1500 PLN and it's a lot for us. Even 1 zloty would mean a lot... I feel really bad for asking about money but we will do everything for this cat to have a great, normal life and even though we just adopted her, we already love her so much ♥️
Please, Zira is counting on you.

'Hey friends! I am blocking the person I am making this post about from seeing it. I have a friend who is just the sweetest person. Shes had a rough life. She lost her fiance and two children. Shes really trying to be strong but shes suffering. She had to face the hardest thing any mother could and pull the life support on her baby. We met just before this happened and I am too far to hug her... Too far to hold her. She was the first person to support my business among the midst of this time. She blows my mind. Now shes out of remission with cancer and shes back in chemo. Shes losing her hair. Shes dealing with pain and illness. Today she had a tough day where someone made her feel really bad about her appearance and the way she smells while going through chemo. Its ripping her apart. She has no real solid support system and no supportive partner. She is in a state of extreme anxiety panic and depression. I noticed in her posts shes putting herself down for not having things she needs not even having the right things to cover her hair loss not in a way where shes seeking pity or help but shes genuinely putting herself down because her self worth has plummeted My heart aches. I remember going through sickness and losing my jobs not having any support the day of my tumor removal, medicines making me sweat through my clothes, peeing myself having no clue about how to buy the right wig or wear it, the mood swings, and the lack of the will to live... I want so bad to be there for her. I remember two strangers named. A.S. and L.W. being the only twobpeople there for me. Thats how i met them total strangers who had hearts of gold and chose to be there for support. I was thinking that I would like to ask for a gift for christmas. Ill post my paypal link in the comments of this post and If you would like to donate towards this and include a message for her with your donation I would like to buy her a wig and the nessicary supplies to make this more comfortable for her and to show her she is loved and valued and that her life is precious and she deserves nice things and she deserves to smile. Ill find an artistic way to include the messages so whenever she feels consumed by loneliness she can turn to them. Thank you for reading and considering helping out! Every single penny will help ! And yes you can share this story with your friends and family and the link to my paypal and my email but the post will only be viewable by my friends because I had to block her from seeing it in the settings'"

If you have a dollar you could contribute so I could help her out a bit, that would be so amazing. I don't like to ask for money; my family taught me to never accept charity.

Edit:I should have put in that I am going to school to become a high school English teacher, much to my family's dismay, so I have been paying for school on my own since I was 18. It's been hard and I hate asking people for help, but I also am desperate at this point.

74,misc,"Hello. I'm kind of new here sadly just because I really need a kind sponsor/donor. Well to keep things short [VoiceMod](https://www.voicemod.net/) is an application that serves as a PC virtual soundboard (alternative for expensive physical soundboards) that I would like to use on Dota 2 games to entertain my team and well to have fun. There is actually a free version but very limited in features and unfortunately the feature that I need is covered within the pro version which costs 20 USD. I currently have 10 USD from my first (and currently last) commission 5 months ago as a freelance starving artist. I really do not want to spend it on this but I also would like to have something for myself this Christmas. I know it sounds absurd for me to want such expensive product despite not having resources but I really would like to have it if there is any less spendy way for me to have it. 

Please do not force yourself or feel guilty if you cannot help. I do believe it is not a primary need for me anyways just something to add some fun in my life so I'd appreciate even the slightest thoughts or wishes. Those are more than enough.

As gratitude to the sponsor, I will illustrate any character/image of your liking in my style for FREE (though I don't think my art is worth much). You can browse my account to have a general idea of my abilities and whether it is a good trade. Of course you can hire me instead if you somehow appreciate my works that will do just fine. Thank you.

You can send me a message if you have any inquiries. I don't expect much donations really but I would gladly discuss further transactions in personal messages to avoid sharing credentials. Thank you very much and happy holidays!"

I support my uncle with USD 50 per month from my salary. and sometime buy him food every evening. He cannot work since he has eye problems for the last five years. His son and daughter don't care about his father's conditions. they live abroad but rarely come to see him out, last time they came is on 2010, they don't wire some money to him at all. I don't know how to contact them since they don't have social media I tried to call them but never connect. I bought 2 hen and 1 cock for him last week.  so he can do something and maybe he could sell it after the chicken has chicks.
I desperately want to help him out more but since my parent's medical condition requires me to spend almost all my monthly salary (my salary is around USD 750 per month) for them.

So today it was brought to the attention of a local community, an elderly gentleman put a bag for life on his garden gate with a note asking for food and electricity as he had nothing. 2 local citizens arranged to meet at the property to see how they could help, on arriving they were greeted by a elderly gentleman called William, he explained that over the past year things have just got too much and couldn't cope! No electricity and No Gas heating for OVER A YEAR...........the house is freezing, infact warmer outside. Locals put £100 of his own money on the gas and electricity meter to find out that the meter hasn't been working for over a year, he spoke to the gas company and they are coming out to sort it with the next 4 hours (that was 5 hours ago). I have spoken to Local Foodbank and they are going to provide help and direction to help him but in the mean time ..................... WE NEED YOUR HELP ASAP. ITS A SHORT TERM FIX but will help somewhat in waking William and feeding him

Anyhow I figured if I can just get up some start money I can do what had given us a chance at life again, I have been fighting major depression along with mental illness and pills that make me drowsy most the time if I take them right, I need the tools to provide I did it before I was doing great had tons of tools and I always fixed everyone's stuff for a small fee. I love computers and was doing what gave us a life and a place to live and rest and have great family times, My kids were stolen from me with my exes help when I went into a mental hospital over 18 years ago for delusions and thoughts, I'm still severely depressed over my kids being taken from me but after many years of trying anything to kill the pain well it is always there no matter what it comes back sometimes harder than others but it's always there, I don't want to keep doing this it's really killing me I have to try and I have to give it one last good shot ok so I figure this is my plan any input is greatly appreciated and will be cherished: since my babies I used to tuck in at night and wake up in the morning are gone hopefully not forever that will really kill me, sand since I have mental issues and I'm severely depressed I must do something about it I can't just try to grab another mind altering drink, I believe God is letting me know it's now the time, so I want to have somewhat of a Christmas for at least my son that I haven't been in contact for over 17 long painful years, he just started talking with me but just for him to tell me he wants to do things by himself he said since it's been that way for so long, (and now is not responding to me) now obviously he doesn't know I've been searching for him and the girls for so long and took a toll on my health because of this. I need start up money to repair and refurbish and resell computers, I think somewhere around $200 to $250 start up cost, I'm very good at computers that when I was doing them I had three nice motorcycles one was a Kawasaki klr650, the other a Honda Shadow 750, and a Harley nightster 1200, and a nice impala always rebuilt and in the driveway along with a nice little apartment along with work space and space for my tools and a work bench to show for it Once people get to know me they always told everybody else that I know what I'm doing and my rates are unbeatable and the lowest anywhere and that I guaranteed everything I sold and just word of mouth put my good name out there like the plague I would have at least three computer sales a day, I older people to learn from and they like me so I like to keep my prices pretty low for everyone unless someone wanted to tip for the work or the equipment they're buying which I always said there's no need to but some you can't argue with, anyhow I would like to get some start up funds going even if some people would pitch in one dollar that dollar added to other dollars would make a world of difference for me to get what I need to repair and rebuild the computers and get the funds to try to go and see my son and pay off my license to legally drive again, I will need tools and software and money to purchase broken ones for rebuilding. I'm not going to sit on my butt any longer I'm done with the drinking although I've done it for about eighteen long sad depressing years days to where I don't even want to be here or even wake up I would always ask God to take me because the pain is just too much. I'm not going to sit and do nothing anymore I'm sick of it I  know I'm homeless but I can start now here today (there is a spot I know of that I can work around at if I ask them I'm sure) and I have to keep trying now with what I have left in my mind body and soul to get to know my kids that were wrongly taken from me and put up for adoption without my knowledge or consent while in the Looney bin WITHOUT MY CONSENT! Yes I'm homeless and don't have much at all except alot of bills, I'm sad, and suicidal, but this is insane if I keep doing and thinking the same things and I know it is. So I want to start trying right now, I want to change my situation because if not it's going to kill me, I want to feel much better than I feel and felt in the past and stop some of these meds or at least lesser doses because of side effects, I want my babies back most of all and I want them back now they are mine not hers she didn't care enough to keep and help them positively grow! I've missed them so deeply for so damn long I wouldn't know what to do if someday my hurt and pain lightened or disappeared, all I know is I can't do this anymore like I'm going because nothing good is happening the pain just comes back 100 times worse and this is my last stop im giving this situation in my life all  my energy everything I have so if anyone can help with anything at all it will be so appreciated it would be giving me the tools to help myself be successful, productive, and constructive so that I can provide so I can better  my and my kids lives, if anyone can donate at least just $1.00 it would be a blessing. $1.00 with others goes a very long way it all counts, I will keep everyone posted on what anyone donates if they wish with their name, if not requested then I will just put donated this much if anyone at all donates to my cause. This will more than likely be my very last stop here as well as in life only time will tell...

She did this for his entire life: carrying him to and from school that is far from their house, etc.

Nobody in the house works, and have been basically living off the kindness of others for some time now. Recently, things have changed and I'm very anxious about the future. There's a city not far away, and I want to move there with my family so I can look for a job and begin supporting myself and my family, though I am the youngest in the household. The thing is, I don't have money, any its going to be one and a half more months if not a bit over that before I get a bit less than $400 back from my college loans that I'm using to pay for school, and that's not enough to move on at all.

He is a ginger hooded, ruby-eyed rex and is approximately 1 year and 3 months old.

Rats are extremely prone to breathing problems and infections, - rex rats even more so.   
Without some antibiotics, Muradin will die. His breathing is laboured and he has lost weight. He's tired, barely eats and constantly comes to me for comfort. I even think he might be scared. I don't blame him. I'm scared too.

Usually, I'd be able to take him to the vet, but with Christmas coming up, all of my bills and trying to prepare for the festivities have meant that I don't have enough money to get him to the vet. I feel like an awful pet-parent, and I don't want to see him suffer or lose him entirely. He is a smart, sweet and wonderful little guy. He deserves a long life.

And I'm still not comfortable with saying everything, so let me just tell you as much as I can right now. You have no idea how many times I have thought about moving out. How many times I was crying alone in my bed. How many times I was just laying there not thinking, not moving. Not knowing what to do with myself. My ex still doesn't understand. He still thinks that the problem is with me and me only. Well, now it is. He wasn't aggressive. He never yelled. He was always speaking in a calm, soft voice. But it was even worse. First, when we moved in, he was a total disaster, he almost never did anything. I thought that I get it - he was in a sh.ty relationship before he needs time. He used to do dishes once a week and after that he was saying that he did so much while I did nothing. But you should hear him saying that. He sounded like a real knight in shining armor who was worried about me. He was so convincing. So manipulative. And I felt bad, so every fucking time I was getting to work. But I was always the one who didn't do a thing. I was always the one to blame for everything. After few months I thought that I don't really care and I stopped. I was exhausted. And guess what. Two more months after that, he started doing everything. But by then I already felt like I don't want to live there and I was wondering if I ever wanted to live at all. Every time when I was considering moving out he was changing again. We were acting like real partners again. But it never lasted for a long time. I dropped out of university 3 months after I started my masters. Few months ago my friend realised that I'm not myself. She asked me what happened to the old me. The one who took care of her health and diet. Who cared about the environment. Who read a lot of books and watched millions of movies. Who wanted to adopt a dog in few month. Who enjoyed life.I started crying. And I couldn't stop. And I didn't know. I probably still don't but I want to fight and be even better person that I used to be. I am moving out. I will live with my friend and her dogs. I have never felt so free and so empowered. I just have to wait two more weeks. But there is a problem. I will need money. My family is not supporting me at all and I can't count on them. I also don't want to ask my friend because she already helped me sooo much. I'm changing my job in a next month but December and January are going to be hard as hell. I have debts, because of this year and my stupidity. I decided to sell my laptop, so with this I will be able to pay a deposit for an apartment. But this month I earned almost nothing from my current job. And I thought that maybe I can do something here. I need to get 150$ or even better 250$ to be able to pay for everything. I was thinking that I can write personalized poems or poems with dedication. I can write personalized Christmas wishes. I can design entire Christmas cards that you can send you friends online. Whatever you want, with any theme you want (I used to be into many things, but if I don't know something I will do my research and I will do my best) Please, I feel horrible with asking for help from strangers but this is huge opportunity for me. I just need to survive 2 months with almost no money.

I'm a college student who is just completely broke. I lost access to my online banking and won't be able to get in and fix the problem until I'm home for Christmas in two weeks. Something went weird when my bank was bought out by a bigger bank, and I need to reset my login. It's been a couple months since that happened, and so I've been trying to be as careful as I could about spending money because I couldn't actually see how much I had left. Yesterday I started getting notifications from Paypal that charges that shouldn't have bounced, bounced. I went through my Paypal account history and Amazon orders and the receipts from any time I've been out somewhere and paid with my debit card, and the numbers just don't add up. I'm not sure what's going on, but there are payments that should have gone through that haven't, for two Christmas presents. One of those orders I was able to cancel, but the other I can't because it was a custom order on Etsy that has already started processing. I talked to the shop owner and it just isn't possible.

Obviously my situation isn't as dire as some of the people here. I don't need much, I just need to get a positive number in my account before I start getting overdraft fees, only about $75. $100 dollars would be great, but I don't need that much. I'll take anything. I have a job, but since it's work-study on campus, none of the money actually goes into my account, it goes directly to my tuition. I just need enough to cover the things I've already paid for that won't go through on Paypal, and I need it in the next few days. Once I get home, I have a job waiting for me.

My husband and I will be donating various items for kids to the Boys and Girls Club in our area. The Boys and Girls Club is a non-profit organization that offers lots of services including after school programs, lunch programs, shelter for homeless youth (they typically go into foster care), education programs, and so much more. This particular club seldom receives donations due to the area its in. 

Currently, this club has 50+ kids using their facilities. Many of the families are low income, and can't afford basic necessities like winter jackets and boots, or gifts for Christmas. The ages of the kids range from toddlers to teenagers and everything in between.

We've made an Amazon wish list full of toys, books, games, essentials, and other items suitable for the Club's needs. I've left the link below if anyone is interested. We can also do e-transfer (for Canadians) or PayPal.

my name is alex and i’m a 26 year old girl residing in the southwest united states. first, i’ll provide some context- i had successful surgery on my right kidney (the good kidney between the two) in late august and thought it would get me by long enough to get back on my feet after 5 weeks of unpaid medical leave from my job. fast forward to now, just a few months later, and i am undergoing treatment for my left kidney already. between the pain, constant appointments, and the heavy likelihood I will have to undergo another surgery or two, i have been forced back on to unpaid medical leave, again... for an indefinite amount of time until i can be well and functional again. I have never felt so defeated, useless, and down right broken... 

Because of this, i am swallowing my pride and finally asking for help. my partner works full time and is usually able to take care of our rent payments and all of our most important bills (utilities, internet, car insurance), and we have cancelled all unneeded subscriptions like netflix, hulu, spotify, etc. Unfortunately, we are still already beginning to struggle with gas for our car so my partner can get to work, food and household supplies, supplies for our kitties, and my medical expenses. 

below you will see i have created a wishlist for things like food, household supplies, and kitty supplies if you feel so generous as to send anything my way. 
any cash donations would be deeply appreciated and will go to gas for my partners car, my prescriptions, groceries (if needed), and upcoming procedures/appointments. this would be unbelievably helpful. i am comfortable sending any proof I have, should you request it. i’m not shy and, at this point, i will do damn near anything if it means i can keep myself and my partner afloat. 

i can also offer small tokens of appreciation/gratitude (like handmade jewelry and crocheted items, resumè creation and career/interview consulting, a sticker pack from my sticker collection, etc) for your donations. I am limited as to what i can offer as tokens (since i only have so many skills) so DM me if you have something in mind.

im a 18 y/o artist who has struggled with mental illness my entire life. my anxiety is so bad that i am unable to leave the house most days and it is keeping me from getting a job. i worked for a former Olympian (for free in exchange for knowledge) but im terrified of putting that on my resume because I left so soon due to their rudeness and abuse towards their animals. my time there made me even more afraid of working and i regularly have nightmares about my time spent there. i have made an effort to try and ignore my fears because I do not want to use my mental illness as an excuse, but it's getting so bad theres nothing i can do about it. i was receiving weekly therapy for anxiety, suicidal thoughts, trauma, ect. for about a year but quit because I was afraid to open up to my therapist. 
since i am unable to work, commissions are my only way of making any money. now that im 18 my parents no longer want to spend money on me, so I am forced to buy my own items such as clothes, things for my dog, and food because i am lactose intolerant and also have issues with textures. i am very picky. recently my old hand me down computer broke and is unable to run. i tried everything I could and asked my tech savvy boyfriend what to do and he confirmed that its 100% dead unless i take it to a shop. because my computer is broken i am unable to do commission work in exchange for money. this has greatly affected me. i am not even able to pay my monthly $3 fee from my bank. my boyfriend has been an absolute angel and does what he can to help me out, but i don't want to burden him anymore because he is also struggling. it's at the point where i have been considering becoming a sex worker to make money. my suicidal thoughts are worse then ever and the only thing keeping me from calling myself an ambulance is the money it costs and how scared i am to speak on the phone.

Earlier this year, I travelled with a friend of mine as he walked across the state of Washington to raise money for the uncompensated care fund at Seattle Children's Hospital. We raised over $175,000 to help pay bills for kids whose families struggle with payment. In short, you shouldn't have to go broke because your kid got sick. You've got enough on your plate. 

We have since made wall calendars to sell with pictures that we took during the trip. 100% of all money made goes directly to the hospital, thanks to sponsors paying for production. We recoup nothing.

My friend Lena is a full time student who usually does doordash. I say usually because even though this girl has been through a lot in life (and really, who hasnt?) The last few months have been AWFUL. The car her and her mom were using to do doordash broke down, and the car they loaned from a friend was hit by someone while they were doing doordash. They managed to scrape up enough money to get a replacement car so they can work whenever Lena isnt in class, but alas - this car is now also breaking down. 

In addition, right after the car accident they were facing homelessness because her moms ex boyfriend kicked them out so he could have a friend of his move in. They managed to scrape up enough money from doordash using the car that is now breaking down to get an apartment, and a month in they are now left with no car, no way to pay rent, and no way to keep their utilities on. 

The mom is a former CNA who was laid off by her former employer because with her physical health issues she couldnt lift the client.

143,misc,"Tldr at the bottom
Hello guys, this is actually my first post of Reddit believe it or not... I suppose a little back story is needed. About a year ago I moved out to Colorado with my husband to where his family lives. We decided to split an apartment with his sister which was mistake number 1. His sister is the youngest and a bit self involved. She's been telling his family that we've been paying rent late and just being assholes to her. We texted her and told hers she's not without fault and now she's looking to cutting the lease. 
We've been having auto problems with almost every car we have. And today when we were looking to sell the old car for scrap we found the window busted and the battery stolen. That's our fault. The other car we got to replace that one, the guy didn't tell us the radiator was bad and the heat isn't working. We live in Colorado where it's been in the 15s for the last couple of days. So now we had to borrow more to get another car. I would at a small retail store and my husband works front desk at a hotel. We're on the verge of being homeless and having to get rid of all our stuff that won't fit into our car. Everytime we think we're getting better more shit just keeps happening and honestly I'm at the end of my rope. I don't really know how any of this works but if anybody can help us get back to my family in North Carolina, anything helps. Thank you for reading 💙

TL;DR: my husband's sister in law in breaking the lease, our cars are undrivable and had to get a new one for work, and we have no money to get back to NC."

168,medical,"Hello,

I'm a college student who is on leave of absence from university because I couldn't cope with mental illnesses anymore. I came back to my parent's place, hoping I could find some time to myself to figure things out, but my life only became more depressing here...

We recently learned that my father's heart is abnormally large and only has 40% of it functioning. He also has water in his heart and lungs. On top of the expensive medicine he needs, the doctor also told us that he needs to have an [echocardiogram](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856) within two weeks. My mom explained to me that, depending on the results of the test, we would have to pay 200,000 to 1 MILLION PHP... and we don't have that much money at all...

Now, my father's condition has become the top priority in the family, while my medical needs had to take the back seat... I'm not feeling resentful about this though, because my father's condition is more critical, so I understand.

However, as the eldest child around here (since my older brother is away for university), I am suddenly thrusted with the heavy responsibility of looking after my father... which is very difficult, considering I can hardly even take care of myself...

I suffer from depression, anxiety, attention deficit disorder, and insomnia. My meds and sleeping pills have ran out, and I'm now relapsing into a dismal state, oscillating between sanity and suicidal thoughts. I feel like I'm such a terrible daughter for being so useless even when the family is going through a crisis...

**Please help me.** I don't know what to do anymore. I need to get better, not just for me, but for my family... I can't keep going on like this... I have to get my act together, but it's really difficult. I don't want to lose my father, but I'm hardly even holding on to myself... Please help. Any small amount would do.

I am an only child and between my dad we balance a job each at opposite hours and the rest of the time we are home in shifts taking care of mum.

She is somewhat able to move around and do basic tasks but suffers from aphasia, a speech disorder, confusing words, and has trouble moving around much on her own. We live on the 2nd floor and there is no elevator. Basically since coming home in 2016 my mum has left the house on two occasions since we do not own a family car, and it requires both of us to be at home to carry her down two flights of stairs and into a vehicle for a short trip nearby.

It has crumbled us financially having to keep bills paid, speech therapist & physiotherapy. Unfortunately we can no longer afford Physio or the speech therapy for that matter.

 [**paypal.me/janehelp**](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/my/profile) 

What i hope to achieve is to raise an amount high enough to move out of our current rented home & find either a smaller more economical house on either the ground floor or at least with an elevator so its more accessible for mum to be able to get out more often with us. Also we would really like to focus on physiotherapy to provide her with the help she needs be stronger on her feet and more stable.

This was my reply:

I got about halfway through. It's incredibly relatable and realistic as far as my own experiences go.

We're a household of four/five/six on ESA and pip. Basically we're one missed payment away from being in Katie's position. As a rule we don't have enough to live on anyway. Our outgoings are as low as we can make them but food bills seen like they're going up every week.

We're not at food Bank level yet, but one DWP fuckup and we'll go under in hours.

I've had to siphon money out of the rent to make ends meet before now. Our social landlord rep was blessedly really understanding about it and we only have to repay a nominal amount a week.

We can only afford Christmas because I borrowed £700 from another redditor. Repaying that loan will leave us almost penniless between Christmas Eve and New year, but that prospect is more palatable than seeing four kids, two of them not ours but ""rescued"" from unbearable and abusive family situations, go without a Christmas.

The scene where she gets caught shoplifting tampons broke me. I had to stop because I was sobbing too hard to see the screen. Tearing up just thinking about it.

That could be us, really really easily. Holding on is knife edge hard. Added to my and my so's mental and physical restrictions, it's a daily...hourly on bad days...battle to keep utter despair from overwhelming me.

Someone has to keep going though.

So yeah, I'm not going to be watching it again. I can't.

178,pets,"gofundme.com/margie-cakes Margie Cakes was found on 11/16/19 hovering against a concrete barrier on a narrow I-40 passage on the west side of the gorge near Tennessee. She was in shock from the speeding traffic so close to her and had obviously suffered trauma and in her hind legs and lacerations. She was wearing a tracking collar and it was soon discovered that she was a hunting dog running bears. The hunter tried to stuff her back into the small dog box on the back of his truck. At that point, the young ladies who had rescued her begged to take her instead. The hunters promised they would take her to a vet. The girls called the hunters phone over the next few hours to follow up concerned  that she would be put down since she was of no use to them any longer and could serve no purpose.  The hunter agreed to let them have her and confirmed their worst suspicions as to his plan for Margie. Margie was provided emergency vet treatment. She was very dehydrated and thin. She has a T11 injury and her hind legs are not working.  She suffered trauma and lacerations and shock.  Although Margie is injured and unable to walk on her own, she is finally free and happy!  She smiles and her eyes are so deep you can see inside her soul. She is grateful and loves to put her face next to yours. She is a beautiful brindle Plott Hound and a little over two years old. It appears that she will not be able to utilize her back legs again and will need a K9 cart and also to finish paying the remainder of her expenses.  She needs lots of prayers sent her way. Margie is a special dog and deserves so much better than the life she had previously living in a box with cedar chips and hardly fed, starved before hunting her prey. Even now, she looks at you as if to say “Thank you for saving me.”  Any money raised will be put toward a K9 cart to allow her to walk again and toward the remainder of her expenses going forward. Thank you in advance for any small amount to help this precious dog!"
179,basicneeds,"Hello everyone,

Due to a clerical error in the permit application process I will be forced to return to the US for three months. I will be leaving my wife and two daughters in Denmark because my wife works full time and my daughters are in school.

My family is dependent on my income to help cover many basic living expenses and my absence will create financial stressed on top of the emotional stresses of separation.

I am seeking help to ensure my family is taken care of and so my wife can afford additional child care while I'm gone.

If anyone needs proof to my claims I can of course provide it. I am a humble person and feel terrible for asking for help...but I don't know what to do.

181,bills,"Hey everyone so to make things short and not ramble.This summer I was left almost dead in a hit and run accident that left my 350z completely totaled and even though I had full coverage on the vehicle geico said they couldn’t replace anything on it because it was all aftermarket nothing was stock. It breaks my heart because that was the one thing I had to show in life no matter if I had a job or was homeless or whatever at least I had a car that I built and had won awards at all the local car shows in town. Di bought it back in highschool and it was my baby ever since. My fiancé at the time couldn’t stand the idea apparently of wasting the summer being stuck inside while I healed from fractures in my spine,shoulder,leg,ribs,and hand so she left me. Said that she shouldn’t have to take care of a grown man and that this was a sign we weren’t meant to be. It made things worse when the first two months went by and I didn’t hear from anyone of my friends and I was just alone,sad,defeated and wanting to end it all.i healed up though got a job and soon after was prompted to a team lead at the Qvc call center that shortly after I was asked to part ways from the company because I openly support the lgbtq community and I’m pansexual myself.so now here I am pawning every item I’ve ever cherished to keep paying for my apartment as well as helping my mother with a third of the mortgage. The only problem is I had to spend the couple thousand dollars I had been saving for a new car on my moms house with repairs and now I’m just trying to keep going when I feel like I should just throw in the towel on life at the moment I’m $150 behind on bills and I’m just eating pb&j sandwiches to get by till I start my new job. Guys honestly it’s hard for me to openly ask anyone for help. I’ve always hated the thought of depending or relying on anyone other than myself but guys I need any help I can get. I’m trying to save up for a cheap bicycle from walmart so I can get to and from work as well. I’m just trying to stay afloat when I’m starting to drown.

188,basicneeds,"Hello everyone 

I do not enjoy asking for help.. I feel embarrassed doing so. I am married and have three kids. This past year has been a challenging year to say the least. We’ve had to contact churches to help pay our rent. We were 700$ behind at one point, luckily that has been caught up. My husband works full time and I am part time. I stay at home during the day to take kids to school and our special needs daughter therapies. She’s still in diapers at 6 and our 1 year is too so those alone are expensive. We do not qualify for SNAP so we are absolutely struggling. My wages will be garnished here very soon because I couldn’t pay a paycheck advance loan. We are in a debt consolidation commitment because we’ve previously done bankruptcy. 

I go to food pantries a lot but a lot of the foods need to be eaten within a day, but I am grateful do not get me wrong. I would LOVE to be able to be able to go grocery shopping and purchase meals and food that will last.

All I’m asking is $5, 10$ or whatever you can help with for food. I have paypal or I can provide an amazon wishlist too. I will work on it today just have gotten discouraged because the other assistance subreddits require you do be minimum of 90 days and I’m only 65 days old. 

Anything is appreciated and I’d be forever grateful. Thank you

Now both myself and my wife work full time jobs however the trouble began when I had to take time off for the surgeries and to pay for funeral expenses, my father left everything to my stepmother who moved out of province shortly after as the will stated their estate would go to his and her children after they both passed away. At this point I had to max out and overdraw my accounts to help pay for the expenses and that of my family. I got behind on some bills and can’t seem to get back on track. I have a struck budget and am working as much as I can and still can’t tread water. I have been selling all my non essential stuff to try to help but it’s slow, I’m a musician as a hobby, my father and I used to jam, most of what I’m selling is my gear and drum kit but have had little interest as it’s not cheap and I’m trying to make the most for what I have. I’ve been barely living payday to payday somehow but am overwhelmed as I have to prioritize what bills get paid and which get put off, and now I’m behind on a few with no clue as to how to restore the balance.

217,medical,"Good day,

tl:dr I have a friend in Kansas who is having heath issues. She doesn't know where they stem from, but she has been unable to work because of them.

"" I have been very ill the last few months. It started with bronchitis and pneumonia, and that caused a cascade of other hidden ailments. I'm severely anemic, and though I was treating it, it apparently wasn't enough. It raised my iron levels, but my red blood cells are too small, so for the last year my organs have not been receiving adequate oxygen. I'm on a higher dose of iron now, but no results yet. It can take months to work, and given that treatment didn't work after a year, I may need transfusions down the road. I also found out I have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a serious form of fatty liver disease. Luckily we found it before cirrhosis set in. I'm still undergoing testing to see what else might be wrong.

Basically, I'm in pretty much constant pain, have frequent nausea, get dehydrated easily, and can't get very far away from a restroom at any given time. I'll spare you the details, but there doesn't seem to be a pattern to when an attack might occur, so I can't just plan around it. Even light housework and running errands can leave me bedridden for a day or longer. Because of this, I haven't been able to work for months and I'm not sure when I can go back.

I don't have insurance and the medical bills and regular expenses are piling up. My savings are completely dried up. Steven has been a huge help. He picks up shifts when he can, takes care of our dog, cooks, and does pretty much all the housework. Unfortunately, one income just isn't enough.

We're applying for SNAP (food stamps) and assistance for rent and utilities, but it's taking a long time, and most places will only help once in a 12-month period. Anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated.""

Anyways, there's a fella here who's wanting to provide me with more CBD to treat my epilepsy, but I need your help to make ends meet so I have the $40 a week that I need to afford the required amount of CBD to keep it in check.

Obviously there's absolutely no worries if anyone simply can't or just rather wouldn't contribute to assist, but if you would like to help (and you're in Canada), you can simply e-transfer me at [katvolver@yahoo.com](mailto:katvolver@yahoo.com).

223,medical,"Hi everyone, I've posted this in other subs, but I am hoping this will reach even more kind souls.

This is for my nephew Sam. He has a rare genetic condition called Prader-Willi syndrome. When he was born, the doctors gave him 2 years to live. He proved them wrong and turned 14 this June. It's been a struggle for him since day one, though. He can't really speak or stand/walk on his own, but he's probably the happiest teenager I've ever met.

He needs spinal surgery as soon as possible because of the severity of his scoliosis, which is starting to squeeze vital organs. The procedure isn't available in our country (Philippines), so he has to have it done in Spain (more affordable than the US!).

As you can imagine, the cost is astronomical - 80k euro for the medical fees alone. We're doing all we can to help Sam get the medical attention he needs, and if you can help in any way, we'd be filled with gratitude.

Learn more about Sam, share his story, and donate if you can via this link: [https://gogetfunding.com/i-got-sams-back-sams-spinal-surgery-fundraiser/](https://gogetfunding.com/i-got-sams-back-sams-spinal-surgery-fundraiser/). Our campaign has plateaued, and it would be awesome to get some momentum again so we can get the surgery done by January. 

Anything you can spare - financially, socially, or spiritually - would help a great deal!

Thank you from our whole family."

2015

With no past medical troubles, i came home one afternoon to find my mum red in the face passed out in her own vomit on the living room floor. I provided first aid and within the hour we were in a doctors office discussing a 10% survival and the possibility of considering organ donations. My mother had two ruptured brain aneurysm and was unlikely to survive.

Four difficult months later of ICU and therapy, miraculously she pulled through and we were home.

I am an only child and between my dad we balance a job each at opposite hours and the rest of the time we are home in shifts taking care of mum.

She is somewhat able to move around and do basic tasks but suffers from aphasia, a speech disorder, confusing words, and has trouble moving around much on her own. We live on the 2nd floor and there is no elevator. Basically since coming home in 2016 my mum has left the house on two occasions since we do not own a family car, and it requires both of us to be at home to carry her down two flights of stairs and into a vehicle for a short trip nearby.

It has crumbled us financially having to keep bills paid, speech therapist & physiotherapy. Unfortunately we can no longer afford Physio or the speech therapy for that matter.

What i hope to achieve is to raise an amount high enough to move out of our current rented home & find either a smaller more economical house on either the ground floor or at least with an elevator so its more accessible for mum to be able to get out more often with us. Also we would really like to focus on physiotherapy to provide her with the help she needs be stronger on her feet and more stable.

At this point, every little bit helps.

I ask that you never neglect the ones you care about, and if you are not feeling well, do not just shake it off, get checked out.

Bless you for taking the time to read this novel of a post!

233,pets,"Hi everyone,

I'm sorry to have to ask this, but I was hoping some of you may be able to help me out.

My sweet dog Bella, a 7 year old Otterhound mix, randomly developed epilepsy around two years ago. Because my mom did not have pet insurance at the time, we now no longer qualify due to her epilepsy being a pre-existing condition.

Bella takes medication 3x daily to help keep her seizures at bay and for the most part it works. Unfortunately a few days ago she suffered a Grand Mal seizure for a prolonged amount of time (generally they're considered very serious if they last longer than a few minutes) and we had to rush her to the emergency vet. She is now stable, but we were slammed with a $1,200 vet bill.

Between my mom and I, we can cover about $750 of the cost, and I just got paid. I'm a waitress, and don't make a whole lot of money. I don't expect the people of Reddit to willingly hand over the extra $450, but if anyone can donate anything at all, I would be SO completely appreciative. We've endured a hard few months financially for many reasons and this just happened at the worst possible time.

I don't know if I'm allowed to put my Venmo here, but I can happily offer it to anyone who may be able to help.

Thank you in advance. <3"

239,bills,"Hello everyone, I’m Fort and I’m starting a new [WordPress.com Blog](https://www.fortnovels.wordpress.com/), for posting translated works. Translating has always been my hobby, and seeing words of one language change into another always filled me with admiration. As such, I thought of starting a WordPress.com blog. I don’t remember when I first became fascinated by the concept of translating, or just languages in general. Computer or Human didn’t matter to me at that time. However, over the years I’ve realized it’s a really fun hobby, and a beneficial skill in this day and age.

Despite the paragraph above, I’m not starting this blog for the sole process of pursuing my hobby. No, I’m doing this because this is my final struggle. I have been dealing with many problems, from lack of money to pay rent that will lead to me being homeless by the 28th of this month, to dealing with stress and anxiety, and also a gallbladder stone that’ll cost me more than my kidneys to get out of my body. Haha…not that I’m willing to sell my kidneys as it’ll only cost me more in the long term.

Some might be wondering why don’t you have a job? It’s because I had to give up school in high school. Yes, you guessed it right, mental and financial problems. Mental problems are in boom nowadays.  
During the second year I became my only family, and the only breadwinner. I couldn’t handle part-time jobs that fed me and my school, and I gave up on the latter. I truly lament that choice till this day.

This and that happened, and earlier this week my landlord handed me an ultimatum. To get out or pay the overdue rent of 4 months. I had been reading novels online for some months whenever I got some free time, and saw that people could make money off of it. It was at that point I thought maybe if I can make enough to just pay the rent from a hobby of mine. Sounds impossible? Yes, even to me, as I’m writing this post, it sounds and seems impossible, and I can see my future as a sweetheart on the street with a comfy quilt just around the corner.

I know this post won’t be read by most, or even laughed at or maybe thought of as scam, or me being not serious enough. Whatever the case may be, I’m tired of living life like a zombie, working tirelessly from day to night every single day and still not making enough to pay my rent or to eat heartily whenever I want. And finally, I don’t want to give up my home as it’s the only place I’ve lived with my parents. With that as my only conviction, I’m shamelessly imploring to anyone who reads this to help me save my parent’s only memento. I don’t need a lot just $2500, but for many even that may be a lot. 

As long as I can get as little as just $1 from a person really wanting to help me, it’ll mean a lot to me. I ask to share this post through link, twitter, facebook, heck maybe even email to people.  
Sharing and spreading this post as widely as possible may restore my faith in humanity. I’ve been treated too badly to believe something as humanity.

I will be translating every single day till the 28th, which is the day I either make it or lose it. If I’m able to survive, I’ll never stop translating. And maybe, probably, I hope I’ll have enough money in a year to maybe redo my schooling years, so I can get a proper job that pays a lot and get done with my gallbladder surgery.

I'm gonna quickly sum up my story. I was admitted to a mental ward for various reasons a couple years ago and in there I became very very involved in drawing. As I got out, I was somewhere that had a PC that could do these kinds of things. It was incredible. Rendering, editing, even gaming! the whole lot. and it was my safe place. making my own creative shit.

It seems so entitled coming out of my lips and I hate myself for wondering what my mental state would be like if I could go through with what I used to cope with the worst of times.

Hello, everyone! I hope you are all having a nice day...I'll proceed to explain my situation. I need money to pay my education. My name is Daniel Hernández and I am 18 years old. I am actually studying journalism at the Arturo Michelena University located in San Diego, Carabobo, Venezuela. My country has been living an economic crisis since 2013 that resulted in what we call humanitarian crisis now. People are starving and eating from the trash and crime and corruption is at it's highest rates. I am a lucky person to have a house and a mom who loves me and takes care of me. I try my best to survive this constant tragedy with a smile on my face and good humour, but it has gotten harder and harder to live decently. I recently got a job as a salesman in a clothing store, I earn 12$ monthly. 12 eggs cost 5 dollars. So you can image how healthy I am eating. I have starved some nights. Even though this whole scenario has made me have suicidal thoughts and develop mental issues I know I, for the most part, have the honour and privilege to have food on the table I started studying the minute I graduated from high school. I am at the sixth semester of my career and I might have to stop studying because I am short of money. Every semester costs up to 20 or more dollars, here this amount is really important, it may sound nonsense but this is what hiperinflation did to our coin. It has no value at all. I also have to use private transport because I do not own a car anymore — we had to sell it — and it costs up to 3 dollars a week. I don't really want to stop studying. I cannot move out now, I don't have the money and also I don't have the documents to do it – which are very difficult to get if you don't have a lot of money – so my only hope is getting my degree and as soon as possible leave the countrt with my mom to seek for a better life...I also have been hapenning to need medicine and funding for my onthodorthic process and mentall illness, if you are interested in helping. 

If you would be able to support me with whatever you want to please contact me — Any questions you have about my situation or any proof you need to proceed and support me please let me know! Thank you so much for reading, I hope you have a nice rest of the day and may God or whoever you believe in, bless your hearts.

**Together, we are raising $50,000 to build a technology center for 1,000 underprivileged youth of the Ojibwe Tribe Boys & Girls Club on Leech Lake Reservation in Minnesota.**   
In the U.S., Native American Reservations have the most urgent need for help. Fewer than 10% of homes on tribal lands have access to internet. The Leech Lake Bank in particular struggles with high rates of alcoholism and drug use, and most of the children in the Boys & Girls Club live in extreme poverty. Only 10% of Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe children go on to higher education (compared to 29% of the general population). Our new center will provide supplies, teachers, training, and support to 1,000 kids in need, inspiring them into higher education, career paths, and greater positive impact on their Tribe.  
My personal goal is to raise $1,000 by September 30th.

But i have a classmate ( were in our first year of university) and his band ( first nations guy) is supposed to be funding his education, but will not buy him a laptop. Most of our assignments are online and he has no laptop or access to a computor outside of the school. If anyone has an extra laptop kicking around doesnt need to be fancy just wifi capable and a charging cord he could use for his studies.  His band is taking their sweet time paying his tuition, and his textbooks id like to find a way to make it easier on him as he wants to do something with his life and he is extremely intelligent.

My wife loves to run and has been hoping to run the New York Marathon for years. She's applied multiple times but has not been lucky enough to get a lottery admission. This year she decided to go the charity route and is raising money for Rising New York Road Runners, which provides free youth program and events to help kids gain confidence and healthy lifestyles.

Unfortunately, she is still more than $1000 away from her required goal of $2620 (26.2 miles, $2620). We've reached out to family and friends and held a few fundraisers so far but it doesn't seem like we'll get to the necessary amount in time. I've been saving a bit but I don't think we'll be able to pay the rest ourselves considering all the other costs associated with flights and hotels.

266,medical,"I don't really know how to go about doing this properly but I feel like I should at least try. I've never asked anyone for anything in my life, but I recently started taking welding classes about a month ago and there was someone in my class I noticed was really intelligent and hard-working and I realized this was the same guy who had been dating one of my classmates since before I graduated high school in 2008. He graduated the same year as me, has the same first name, has the same bike as me except 1000cc instead of 600cc, so I thought it all was kind of a cool coincidence.

&#x200B;

The dude busted his ass at work every day, showed up to class, is a funny dude, and has been killing it on all the tests so far. I currently only have a motorcycle so I've been riding it exclusively, which is fine because I'm used to it. Class is Monday-Thursday from 5 to 10 PM. Last Thursday he told me he was going to try and ride his bike the next day, which he did, and we ended up going for a ride on our lunch break. He told me he hadn't even rode his all year which kind of worried me because we both have really fast bikes.

&#x200B;

Anyway, we leave school and I told him I'd ride with him the way he was going but I'd be turning off at an intersection because he lives 15 minutes away from where I do. He was a good distance ahead of me on the highway and was definitely going too fast, and possibly wasn't aware of where the intersections were, but I pulled over into the left lane and started slowing down. This intersection actually has ridiculously poor visibility due to how the ground is inclined. I get a sick feeling before I even saw anything and as I pull up to it can tell the lights and scene I'm seeing aren't right at all.

&#x200B;

I see a car in the middle of the highway and a bike laying on the ground with no rider in sight. I pulled over to shoulder of right the side of the road and see the driver on his phone standing outside of his car obviously on his phone calling for help. Everything is going in slow motion for me and I'm sick to my stomach, 100% sure he is dead and I'm just standing there staring at the scene in front of me. The guy on the phone yells to me, ""can you go be with him?"" and I immediately run to the other side of the car and he's laying there on his stomach. He somehow has his flip phone open and is talking to his girlfriend on speaker and says, ""man, I'm fucked up. I'm so fucked up. Do I look fucked up? Man, please tell me if I look fucked up."" and I'm just telling him that he's going to be OK, he tells me to talk to his girlfriend (who is at the local fair with his little sister and her boyfriend) and I tell her where to go and she told me something to do with her number that I immediately forgot and didn't do. He somehow pulled his own helmet off of his head while I was talking to her.

&#x200B;

He was somehow only probably 20 feet away from the wreck, the upper half of his body on the grass and the lower half on the gravel, and his feet were laying in the road. He asked me to turn him over and I could see blood coming out from under him and figured he had an insane amount of bones broken so I told him that I'm sorry but I can't do it. A fire has somehow started on top of the hood of the car and ends up spreading quickly and I don't know exactly what could happen so I'm standing in front of him in case something blew up because I figured anything hitting him would make sure he was dead. Everything is kind of a blur but the car ended up becoming completely engulfed in flames. The local fire department, state highway patrol, and I assume what is also the fire department (green vests) are the first people to arrive, and a lady tells me to get back.

&#x200B;

The ambulance takes FOREVER to get there, as in his girlfriend who was in the middle of the fair somehow got there directly after. He was taken to a nearby hospital and life-flighted. He suffered severe pelvic damage, damage to his lower body, and a vascular surgeon managed to perform a skin graft to save his right leg. Parts of his intestines were removed and somehow reconstructed. I don't know much about the medical field. I don't know if he suffered spinal damage and I don't want to ask because I'm just hoping he will still be able to walk. His girlfriend has kept things updated on Facebook and it has gone from looking completely bleak with the first day of him being in critical condition, to going out of surgery, to having to go back into surgery.

&#x200B;

He is currently breathing on his own but there's so much stuff going on I don't even know how to explain. Everyone probably thinks we were doing stupid shit and racing but he was far ahead of me and probably just enjoying the freedom of being on a bike. Yes, it was stupid but he has a kid and a girlfriend and she's having to take off work. I have a seriously good feeling he's going to pull through though and everything will be OK in the end.

&#x200B;

I don't even know if I'm in the right place or if this is what this subreddit is for, nor do I even know how to go about organizing something to ask for donations, etc. It's a rough situation to handle and I'd like to be able to help but don't really know where to start."

Hi everyone! 

On October 5th I will be participating in 'Light the Night' sponsored by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society in order to shed light on the darkness of cancer. 

My mother recently passed away from cancer in January. Since her passing, life has been undoubtedly harder for my family and I. She was the brightness in every room that she entered and I am hoping to send a little bit of light up to her. 

By providing a small donation, you can help people like my mom who were impacted by this awful disease. The money raised through Light the Night allows the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to fund treatments for people who are suffering from all forms of blood cancer.

Help me defeat the darkness of cancer, please. Any small donation helps!

275,bills,"Right now I am in dire need of a bit of assistance with my rent. If I don’t have the full amount to them tomorrow, then I will get evicted. I have nearly everything I need but not quite. 

I’ve had a seriously tough couple of years. I lost my Mom in 2015 and I’m still having to pay to sort out probate issues with her things. I went through a bad and long (and expensive) divorce from a manipulative and frightening man after a 10 year marriage. He stole all of our savings and left me with a ton of bills. Then I had to move quickly with all my pets and belongings from a house I thought I’d raise my children in and live for the rest of my life. Luckily I found a new place to live but rent has been difficult the past two months. I didn’t have transportation at all due to an awful car accident (didn’t get anything back since it was an old 90s volvo). I recently found a decent truck to purchase and it was doing great - until it wasn’t all of a sudden - so now I’m still not even sure what the issue is (hoping it isn’t the transmission) but I had to pay to get it towed an hour back to my house. That, along with previously helping my elderly Dad out with a few necessary living expenses, has unexpectedly put me behind in my very tight budget over the past couple months. I’ve borrowed from friends and family, which has been really difficult for me and I’ve lost a lot of pride, but I had to do what I could to survive... I have loans against my 401k. Several things with the divorce process (longer story) has made my credit awful and my one credit card left is maxed and I can’t seem to get any loans. I’m not sure where else I can turn at this point… 

I am employed full time and I’ve been picking up extra hours, so I managed to pay August rent late (along with court eviction filing fees and extra late fees from my rental company). Now I am trying my best to get the September rent paid by tomorrow to prevent the eviction/lock out from proceeding. I would deeply appreciate any help at all to keep me from losing my home.

280,pets,"I hate asking for financial assistance for my own problems, but I’m desperate. Even if you don’t end up donating, maybe this can be my therapy.

This past year has been the worst in my life. I accept the consequences I’m responsible for, but there has been a pile of unforeseen, unwarranted bad situations too. I’m putting myself through law school, working a part time job that barely paid, and living independently. Finances were tough and life was stressful, but I had a couple of things in particular that kept me going: my boyfriend and my dog.

My boyfriend has supported me through so much: my depression, anxiety, stress, finances, everything and anything. My 4 yo French Bulldog, named Tato, has supported me too. He’s been my companion and a source of joy ever since I got him as a puppy. I have only 2 pictures hanging at work, and they’re of them. 

Well this past weekend, Tato has a strong reverse sneeze attack. He’s had these before, but this one was the worse it has been. He had strained himself so hard during it that he locked up and fell to his side. 

The emergency vets juggled us around, until they finally suspected a herniated disk and possible IVDD. His limbs are paralyzed. I must spoon feed him wet food and bottle him water. He eliminates in his bed because he doesn’t when we hold him up outside. 

The vet recommended and MRI and possible surgery (totaling $7K) which is scheduled for this Thursday. My friends and family have rallied to raise just under $4K, but we are still far from our goal. Even if every person donated just $1 each or shared his GoFundMe page, it would make a world of difference. 

I am still actively pursuing every avenue I can. I’m kicking myself for not getting pet insurance. I applied for Care Credit. I’m considering quitting law school to work full time again. But I’m terrified it won’t be enough and it won’t be fast enough. 

Please, if you understand how dogs can become family and a support system to you, please help Tato at GoFundMe.com/helpTato. 

TLDR; I’m about to lose my dog, who’s family to me and my life’s support. I need help paying for his medical treatment. Please 🙏🏼 (If you’re here to troll, please skip me for today. I’m in a very low place right now.)"

This is a way of looking inside the body using a flexible **tube** with a small camera on the end of it. The endoscope is **inserted** through the mouth and down the esophagus, which leads to the stomach. Which then we will pump more nutrition because he has uncontrollable spastic shakes, that just burns all the caloric intake.  


I am devastated because the doctor did give us a fair warning that since he is immobile, he is at a very high risk of infection and the worst part is, he cannot tell us if he is sick, he has never talked nor walked. His name is Aaron Mathher Hernandez he is 6 years old and wheel chaired bound, we live in South Texas, (RGV) and we need funds for  travel and other expenses. The hospital is in Houston (Texas children's hospital), where my wife and son currently are.   


I love my boy he's a happy camper but it has drained us that i gave all i had to my wife and it was not enough, this hurt extra bad, but I ain't going to let this weaken me, I was born a fighter, I have always found a way, i always will but my vision has been obstructed by thick tears. I need some Reddit love to illuminate the path so i can keep going and find a way.

282,pets,"In a video circulating Facebook, Eugenia kisses and cuddles a beautiful white and brown cat. She cleans him, dresses him in a diaper (due to urinary incontinence), and a specially designed 'cat-sack' which protects his legs when he drags himself around on the floor. This is the day-to-day norm at **Ladybug Kitty Nursery**, an independent volunteer project run out of Eugenia's own house!  Her mission is to provide temporary shelter and medical care to Romania's unwanted and abandoned cat population while they await adoption. Some of the cats are perfectly healthy, while others come to her with special needs such as blindness, amputation, FIV+, cancer, urinary incontinence, etc. Sadly, many of the issues these cats have are due to human cruelty.

&#x200B;

*How did Ladybug Kitty Nursery begin, you ask?*

&#x200B;

*It all started in 2014 when Eugenia saved a paralyzed cat that was attacked by a pack of dogs in front of her house. She had no money to see a vet, didn't even know of a vet caring enough to be trusted with such a special little cat! She realized there was no place for special needs cats to go after being rescued, so she took it into her own hands. And after this cat was adopted, others started to hear about the wonderful gift Eugenia had given it and wanted to help.*

&#x200B;

*She decided to call her project the Ladybug Kitty Nursery, in honor of that first kitty, Ladybug.*

&#x200B;

Eugenia can't do it on her own, though. She needs help! She relies heavily on donations for the things these cats need, such as litter, diapers, wipes,  cleaning supplies, cat toys, towers, pee pads, pillows, blankets, etc!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**9/10/2019 HELP NEEDED URGENTLY!**

&#x200B;

There has been an outbreak of panleukopenia at the Nursery!  5 out of the 6 kittens who showed symptoms have already passed (Mumy, John, Mina, Micu, Amy Lee).

&#x200B;

Panleukopenia is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease caused by the feline parvovirus. Kittens and unvaccinated cats are most severely affected.  THIS is why your donations are so dearly needed and appreciated, to help keep these babies healthy.  Unfortunately, due to no fault of Eugenia's (some kittens do not have up-to-date shots due to receiving antibiotics at the time, or they were underage) the virus has been allowed to spread.

&#x200B;

Every cat brought to the Nursery has tested negative for  panleukopenia, otherwise they wouldn't have been taken in, as Eugenia knows that this is an absolute nightmare for a cat fosterer. Mumy unexpectedly tested positive a few days ago and sadly has since passed. Any cats that begin to show symptoms are moved upstairs to the quarantine room where they recieve fluid therapy, antibiotics and a hyperimmune serum that has proven to be highly effective. Unfortunately, however, cats are still dying.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Right now the cats at Ladybug Kitty Nursery need your help more than ever.  There are vet bills that need to be paid, air purifiers that they desperately need, as well as stainless steel food bowls, etc.  Essentially anything these cats have come into contact with needs to be destroyed. Eugenia is hard at work sanitizing everything that can be salvaged.

&#x200B;

Any and all donations are tremendously appreciated! After all, don't forget this is an independent project run from Eugenia's own house! She's doing the best she can, but she needs our support!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are several ways you can help:

&#x200B;

This means I need a car. I want to buy a used car with cash so i no longer have payments to worry about.
I have found a great car for just under 6k. My goal is to raise 7k to have wiggle room for taxes, fees, etc. anything I don’t use, I will donate back to causes on this subreddit.

The reason I need a car is because I have 2 jobs and go to school (school started tuesday). Without a car, i will lose my jobs, my insurance, and my ability to provide for my disabled mother and autistic brother.

This is very time sensitive, as my car will be repo’d soon, i fear. PLEASE help.

I've been overweight my whole life. Over the years I've developed multiple conditions such as; diabetes, severe sleep apnea, depression, social anxiety, PCOS, diabetic neuropathy in my feet and hands, diabetic issues with my eyes that require injections in both eyes every 10 weeks or I could go blind, mulitiple herinated discs in my lower back that has made it difficult to stand or walk, I'm also on 15 different medications, etc. I'm 27 years old and I've never really had friends. I've never had a boyfriend. I've never really felt loved at all. I can't work so money is tight, and I'm still trying to get disability. I'm tired of being sick and lonely. I'm tired of feeling ugly and unwanted. I just want to be normal. I want to be able to work, have my own place, be in a relationship, and most of all have kids. So I'm just asking for help, this surgery will save my life. Anything you could give would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions please feel free to message me.

297,misc,"My brother is 23, autistic, and living with our parents.  In the next three months or so our parents are planning to move to Georgia (we live in Florida) and they intend for my brother to go with them.  He absolutely does not want to go, our dad travels a lot for work and often is away for long periods of time, which would mean he would usually be stuck at home with our mom.  She’s narcissistic and controlling, and over the past few years her behavior has taken a serious toll on my brother’s mental health.  He feels stressed and depressed much of the time, and an environment where it would only be him and our mother at home for long stretches of time would, we both think, have a very negative impact on him.

He does have a job, but he rarely gets scheduled despite being part time.  He gets one shift every week or two, and hasn’t had much luck in picking up from his coworkers.  He’s trying to save up money so he can afford an apartment with some roommates, but currently only has about $400 to his name (a lot of which goes toward his car payments + insurance).  I’m also trying to help him financially here and there when I can, but I’m also in the midst of moving apartments and am transitioning jobs at the moment.  He’s hoping to have at least $1,500 saved up by the time our parents are ready to leave, but he’s extremely worried that if things don’t work out with his job that he might not make it.  It’s this desperation that led to him letting me make this post in the first place; usually he doesn’t like taking from strangers.

If you are willing to donate his venmo and cashapp are both under ChaosHero236.  I really don’t want to see my brother be forced to leave his job and friends and home, so any little bit helps.  Thank you."

301,misc,"gofundme.com/telescopeforjames

My boyfriend, James, and I have been dating this time around for a year now, but our story starts 12 years ago. We dated briefly way back when we met in grade 8. Immaturity, timing and bad decision-making left us going our separate ways, but little did we know we both considered each other our soul mates all these years. We completely lost contact, but fast forward to a year ago, we ran into each other at the grocery store. We both couldn’t believe who was standing in front of us (you could see it on our faces) and rambled on about where we were in our lives and updated each other a bit, and then parted ways again. That day started a whirlwind of emotions in both of us, and we began messaging and opening up about how we never forgot each other and hoped to one day be brought back together again. And here we are! He literally treats me like a princess, and I’ve never known a human who better intertwines with everything I am. We love all the same things (including, but not limited to: french-press coffee first thing in the morning, going metal detecting, doing trash clean-ups in the streets, painting, tending to our garden, cooking, hiking, camping and having bonfires, looking at the constellations etc). James has high functioning aspergers, and he makes me proud every single day. For example, he just filed a bullying report about a coworker of his that he witnessed bullying another coworker, who, James thinks is on the autism spectrum because of certain behavioural cues. He didn’t stand for it at all, and immediately reported it. I’m not only proud of who he is, but proud to be his girlfriend. He makes every day count, and reminds me to not take life so seriously. To put this into perspective, a regular grocery store trip just to grab bread is easily turned into a big fun fest with me - and strangers within earshot - literally in hysterics because he has no filter (he is an aspie after-all) and he’s the most hilarious person I know. He makes a positive impact on everyone he meets, I’m sure of it. But I’m here to ask for your help. He gives so much, and I want to be able to give back to him! I’m a student with a part-time minimum wage job, and he is a full-time minimum-wage worker. We definitely have enough money to be content and live comfortably for now, but I don’t have anywhere near enough to splurge on anything to spoil him on his birthday for being such a wonderful human (on my birthday he bought me a beautiful opal promise ring - how can I top that?!). So his birthday is coming up and I want to surprise him with a really amazing telescope! A specific one he has mentioned is the Celestron Nexstar 8SE which are $1,500. He’ll tell anyone who will listen about his passion for stars and planets and owning a really good telescope one day. When he talks about it his whole face lights up, and I just want to be the one to open him up to that whole new world through the lens of a telescope. When the night sky is clear, you’ll see us out on our front deck with his binoculars, trying to get a closer look at the stars and the moon - but I want to give him better than that! Please help me make his dreams come true :)"

[You can check the program's website here](https://compro.mum.edu/)

However, the money needed to sign up for the program is usually $3500-$7000, **but with this special offer I only need to pay 2000$** (plus another 2000$ for personal use when I am there since I won't have any way of getting money when I am there till I get a part-time job or something) My family cannot afford the fees, they are barely feeding us and getting the necessities we need since they are both deaf and mute so it's harder for them to work than normal people, and as a practicing Muslim, I cannot take out the kinds of loans with interest that are usually offered to students, because charging or paying interest is not allowed in our faith. I’m asking for your help with $2000 of those fees.

I have worked hard in university for 3 years just to get an opportunity like this! This is my chance to build a bright future for myself and my family. It has been my dream to study abroad, and money is the only thing keeping me from following that dream now.

Edit: some people here might think that my post has no meaning and other people should get attention while I don't deserve it because my campaign is stupid, I just wanted to mention this, maybe you don't know how it is to be in a poor family, here in Algeria it's so hard to find a job even if you do, you won't be able to keep up with the monthly expenses especially for my parents and they really did everything for me, I want to at least repay some of their kindness before they pass away and I want to relieve them of their stress and help them out, they are growing old and they won't be able to work anymore so it's up to me as the older son to help my family and I really can't do that in Algeria, I need to finish my studies abroad and get a decent job so I can help them with everything I can, I am not asking for a lot, **if each person here donated 1$ it would mean a lot to me, it will just take 2000 people donating** but even if it doesn't at least the small money I gathered might bring me close to my goal, if you don't like this post or think it's stupid just ignore it please \^\^

I\`d like to set up a private animation studio that will be involved in the production of animated media. I will conceive products to produce, own the physical equipment for production, employ operators for that equipment, and hold a major stake in the sales or rentals of their animation works.

The pilot project of my animation studio will be to create animated and explainer civic education videos that will reach the ordinary man and woman. This is because I have seen that most people are unaware of their basic civil, human and fundamental rights in my country.

I\`d like to combine civic education with short animation videos to reach many people and make them aware of their rights and obligations as a citizen of my country, as well as other important matters for example, matters that are of public interest and affect them directly such as changes in law, regulations and other things that they might not have otherwise been informed.

My objective is to build a world class animation studio that will be known to produce top – notch animation contents and to become the number one choice for TV and online platforms.

If you have any questions or clarifications, please PM me.

333,misc,"To all the generous members of this sub-reddit,

I am a 30-year-old guy from Pakistan. I've been working as a freelance web content writer from home for the past 11-12 years. Presently, I am primarily supporting my household, which includes my parents. There have been a lot of ups and downs in my life, perhaps even some highs, but somehow I've managed to help make ends meet.

Shortly before April though, I wound up losing a major source of my income. So, I decided to invest some money into my own blog/website, for which I had to purchase a domain and web hosting. I was fairly certain and hopeful that I'd finally manage to earn a decent monthly income, while also creating something of my own.

Unfortunately, I haven't managed to earn anything feasible from it. Yet, I haven't given up hope and am working hard on getting it off the group. My blog/website is just 3 months old, so I am still hopeful and positive that this venture will eventually prove to be fruitful. I am also an author and I've published some erotica, but it isn't too lucrative yet either.

Getting to the point though. I know this may sound bad and wrong, but for my own personal reasons, I had to lie to my parents and I've claimed that I've managed to earn $1,200 over the course of the past 2 months or so. It may not make sense why to you, but although I'm the one earning, my father handles the household budgeting and financing.

Hence, considering that I do not have $1,200, I now find myself in a crisis. Once again, it is too complicated to explain, but my parents will flip if they discover that I do not have the money I claim to, which will lead to dire circumstances. Consequently, I've been experiencing tremendous anxiety and depression since the past week or so. I don't mean to exaggerate or gain unfair sympathies but I've been feeling a bit suicidal because I feel like my world is collapsing around me, which may end up being true.

The reason I decided to state all of the above is to explicity present my current situation and why I decided to post here, and also for the sake of utmost transparency. I know that there are probably far more deserving causes and charities that deserve attention and monetary assistance. I never imagined that I'd find myself in a situation like this, but I'm utterly desperate and panicking.

TL;DR: I am in desperate need of coming up anywhere between **$800** and **$1,200** within the next few days. I know this practically impossible, but this is kind of my last resort, so I thought I'd give it a try, in any case.

The money I receive is supposed to go towards my household expenses and rent for the month of August 2019. This is somewhat unrelated, but my father was recently diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes, so I need to begin saving money for his surgery as well. If manage to get through this crisis and raise enough money, I have vowed to turn my life around and secure a more stable source of income.

As I am in Pakistan, I cannot create a GoFundMe at the moment, but I will ask a friend of mine in the U.S. to do so. Once again, I know it is probably impossible to raise **$1,200** within 3 to 4 days but if anyone here might be generous enough to contribute any sort of amount in order to get me out of this predicament, here is the PayPal email of the same friend: roswell250@hotmail.com

To anyone who decides to help me out, I will be forever be grateful and obliged. I may not be able to pay you back, perhaps, but I promise to pay it forward some day. While it is not mandatory, if anyone does decide to transfer an amount, it would be helpful if you could leave a comment below and mention the amount. That way I could inform my friend and above all, thank you for your contribution.

And as lucky as I am we got stoped at the border and they told us we have two options, if we have anything we can give them immediatly or they are going to search us. I'm not a big time drug user, I've done it just a couple of times and offcourse I got scared imediatly. I gave them what I have and for that I got 450€ penalty + 30€ for paperwork. Well I just ended my secondary school and thank god I worked while going to school so I'll be able to pay the bill but after that I'm broke so if anyone is prepared to help me I would be really gratefull.

Originally, we were hoping to use our tax refunds to get a place. The Dept. of Education took his. My measly refund is still being processed, and I've given up on receiving it. 

I've contacted countless organizations, and I'm told the same things over and over: ""No room"" ""Do not qualify"" ""We don't offer those services"" ""We're too low on funds right now"" and it just goes on. 

I feel so broken. Neither of us have family that could help us. I just want my kids to have a real home again."

My parents are helping as much as they can, but we really need help with stuff for my dog. Most of the money I was planning to use for gear/furniture/toys for him was stolen by the breeder, so I was able to basically just purchase a dog from a different breeder and do most of the training myself and get money for his care essentials from friends.

The reason I lost my phone is because I've been homeless for a hot minute, and it got busted up in May. I haven't had the funds to pay the insurance deductible, yet. I've been staying at a Mountain Sanctuary, and they're willing to let me use their mailing address while I'm here, but I only have until this Friday (07/19) before they're asking me to leave so there is room for new guests. Once I place the insurance claim, the phone is shipped over night. So I really only have today to finish trying to raise the money.

Thank you for reading.

**TL;DR : I'm $20 short on getting my phone replaced. Getting the funds is time sensitive, because I won't have a mailing address after Friday. If you have anything you could donate,** [HERE is the link.](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8gvrYBYIuS)"

I have until Thursday to come up with a significant amount of money as Friday I'm due in eviction court. My two roommates decided to move out on me right before Christmas, leaving me to pay 2/3 more of rent that I was not expecting to pay and due to the Holiday did not have in the bank. I've notified my landlord about the situation, and they don't care (its a business obviously and I get it). I've been denied for loans online, pawned of what I could and I still find myself searching the couch cushions for change in tears . i have contacted 211 but based on my income I was overqualified for rent assistance. Then I heard of St. Vincent and found a local office. So mainly the point of the post is just to ask if anyone has used them before and know the rules/qualifications. I checked out their website and saw something about a month wait.. Does anyone know if that's accurate? Or of any other organizations that may be able to help in a more prompt way?"

I have received help here before, and I just received a little in the comments of this sub. I just wanted that to be known. I don't want to ask again, but god knows i need to! Short story on why I'm requesting. My husband is the bread winner, and he has always got us by just fine,( family of 6 ) but his work slowed down and he's making less than half of what he normally does. Pay checks have always been an inconsistent amount just because he gets paid for whatever job he does, individually, but the amount he's been getting isn't enough to live off of and it is catching up to us really fast!  Work is slowing picking back up ( he is looking for a better paying job with a SET pay right now) but that isn't going to help us at the moment! I do market research and surveys online right now to try and help, I'm almost to the 25 dollar limit to cash out on my app, but it is going to take a couple days to get there ( you only get a couple surveys a day)  and then up to 3 days for a posted payment. My husband just applied for a small loan threw his retirement to help us out of the hole this has put us in, but that could take weeks. We paid our rent and 1 other bill ( couldn't pay my car insurance because the money just isn't there) and we literally have no money left at ALL! If anyone could help with some food items, diapers and basic household items, I would be so grateful! You have my word that I will pay it forward as soon as we get threw this!

370,bills,I'm new to Reddit and stumbled across this sub and thought it may be worth a shot because honestly I don't know what else to do. About 3 months ago I got a new job. It's a dream job and it kind of just fell into my lap. Because I wasn't expecting to switch jobs I didn't have enough money for the gap in pay checks so I overdrew my bank account and I've been trying (with a little success) to get ahead. A couple days ago I got a letter from the bank letting me know if I don't pay off my overdrafts in 14 days they will be going to collections and I really do not want that to happen. I was overdrawn about $700 but I've managed to get it down to $350. I do still have bills coming in so that also makes it hard to keep my account positive when a big chunk of my checks are going to paying off the overdraft but $350 will just about cover it. I know it's quite a bit of money but anything helps and I would be so so grateful if anyone could help me.
