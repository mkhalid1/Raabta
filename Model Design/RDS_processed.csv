It's been a goal of mine to get my long time friends and partners better PCs.  
We live in different countries and gaming together was the way we initially connected (with each other and our extended friend group) and is still one of our main sources of group entertainment.   
Their current PCs are old Dells from the 90s running intel graphics however and struggle with anything but the simplest of games (default minecraft with the graphics down runs, dark souls runs at about 10fps, etc)   
Life always manages to get in the way of being able to upgrade however and whilst they don't like asking for money, I will absolutely ask for them!   


I've put together builds for budgets PCs that would run about $300 for each PC with room to upgrade.

I finally got them to create a money pool so I could help by donating a bit at a time (set to $1200 but that is just a generous ceiling for GPU and all, $600 is closer to accurate) and would be eternally grateful to anyone who wishes to help, with however much they wish to spare!

(Weekly payments needed this place sucks its a long story) in the past we’ve come close but family managed to help us but this time we’ve been told they aren’t going to help us and I’ve frantically tried everything at this point. Selling all my possessions anything of value, doing lewd things for extra bits of cash but I’ve only managed to scrape up like 30$ on top of the leftover cash from our last pay period last Friday. And that’s only like 50$ (last I checked however bf might have used some for gas today) and we owe 279$ for the week. I have a few odds and ends to sell so I’m willing to not just take free money but please help me out. I don’t want to even think about what happens if this place kicks us out. I have kids. I’m freaking out. My bf works full time (and a second place) I watch our children and sell on eBay but my business has really tanked as of late it’s really not doing well. In fact fees are hurting me and I may just close the account. 

I’ve applied to jobs even fast food at this point but daycare is an issue as my family wants nothing to do with my bf or his sons we would have been just fine as expected until we got our electric bill and it really fucked us bad I don’t know what else to do I’ve written here before in times of panic before friends had helped me out but they’re hands are tied too so I really am stuck

Literally anything would help even a dollar I swear to god. I can show bills, I’ll surely get a notice today for rent (landlady is quick to post them) I’ll show that, and if you are interested in the items I can afford to sell pls dm me if not, I offer other things and if you can’t afford to help I 100% understand that just please I ask you to share this or spread the word I can even draw anime like stuff I’m not very good but anything for compensation Nothing is too far fetched at this point I really am desperate mY HAIR IS TURNING WHITE IM ONLY 25 WTF"

15,medical,"WARNING: KIND OF GROSS PICTURE.

&#x200B;

Okay, so. I have some pretty weird teeth because I had a lot of high fevers as a kid, and in the last few years I've had a couple of teeth just . . . hollow themselves out. No apparent cavities or anything (although I have plenty of those elsewhere, my teeth are crap in spite of regular brushing and my funds are low), they just go hollow.

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago I noticed this weird swelling on my gum. But it didn't hurt, and this being December and me working in the service sector, I sort of went ""I should get that looked at"" and forgot all about it.

&#x200B;

I woke up this morning and that swelling is very, very angry about being forgotten. It's doubled in size, it's centered right over one of those hollow teeth, it's *throbbing* and the gum around the tooth is bright red. I've had to do this before: it's an infection and the course of action will be ""dental visit, 'we can't save this tooth,' antibiotics, another visit, pull it.""

&#x200B;

Even through the cheap dentist in my town that's going to be around $450: three hundred to pull the tooth (*I'm not joking it's fucking ridiculous*), $60 each for dental visits, and about twenty bucks for the antibiotics.

&#x200B;

In the past, I've always been able to pull money from *somewhere* when one of my teeth decides to go rogue. But because it's year-end/year-start, my final 2019 paycheck was out-of-cycle and constituted one week's pay that has to last three weeks instead of my usual ""two weeks' work for two weeks' pay"". Once I paid phone and rent, that was all gone, and I don't get paid again til the 21st.

&#x200B;

If some guardian angel wants to throw the whole $450 at me I certainly wouldn't say no, but right now my main concern is eighty dollars: enough to get in, get meds, and get this infection down. I'm running through PayPal because GoFundMe says it takes up to a week to get funds and I literally cannot wait a week (if the infection got that much bigger that fast, its next stop will be my sinuses), so I can be found at [technicolor\_nina@yahoo.com](mailto:technicolor_nina@yahoo.com), BUT . . .

&#x200B;

If you want proof, here's a (gross, sorry) picture. You can see the hollow tooth third back, with the broken bottom. That weird gray/black quality isn't cavity--it's literally a lack of tooth innards. I had to get the camera too close to my mouth to do the traditional ""paper with my reddit name on it"" thing, but you can pop the image into Google search, nothing else will come up.

Winter has arrived in Greece, temperatures have dropped drastically and it has been raining for days on end. There are currently more than 7500 people living in the hotspot on Samos, the southern-most Aegean island, in a camp which is build to only host 648 people. This means the numbers of people have DOUBLED within the last 10 months and the camp is more than 11 times over capacity.  Most of these 7500 people are sleeping in tents and makeshift shelters which provide no protection against the cold or wet. For us, this means  even more people are coming to seek some warmth in our community centre, shelter from the rain, a hot cup of tea, an hour away from the  conditions in the camp, away from the rain and cold. 

We are running the biggest community centre on the island, and our doors are open six days a week for everyone who wants to come. We teach  an unbelievable 120 classes weekly - 19 daily language classes, alongside art, fitness or music practice - and we offer activities for children and women. We also run the only laundry station on the island, offering some basic hygiene for people living in muddy and wet tents. With the increased number of people and the terrible living conditions the needs are getting bigger and bigger - but our resources are scarce. 

Samos Volunteers relies 100% on donations. This winter, we urgently need your support to be able to maintain our activities during the next months to keep our lights on, our tea warm and our classes running.

 The Children’s Museum in West Hartford, Connecticut offers hands-on fun with science and nature for younger children and families, school and community groups, and home schooled children. At the Museum and in classrooms throughout Connecticut and New England,  we encourage children to become creative thinkers and lifelong learners. Children engage in our interactive labs, workshops, multi-sensory exhibits and demonstrations, a live wildlife sanctuary, state-of-the art digital science dome planetarium shows and movies. Our unique Children’s Museum Preschool, co-located on our West Hartford campus, integrates science experiences into early childhood learning. Nearby Roaring Brook Nature Center in Canton offers environmental exhibits, nature programs, concerts and acres of outdoor hiking, and bird watching.

We serve under represented children and families, bringing quality education to communities that might not have access to this curriculum.  We house over 300 injured/sick/abandoned animals, and rehabilitate and release 900 animals per year back into the wild . We need help to end the year strong so we can continue our mission. Every donation is tax deductible and if you get one in before 12/31,  you get a tax deduction for next year!

Thank you for any and all support!"

I have been talking to him for more than six months now but I haven’t met in person. He’s really helped me with my mental health and personal struggles, more than anyone I’ve met in real life. Its funny how I was able to fall in love with someone I haven’t touched or smelled or been with.  

I’m from Toronto and he’s from Florida. I’m a university student barely making it by as it is, so any help would be appreciated. 

I hope you’re all having a good holiday."
54,pets,"Hello reddit,
Normally I don't ask for favours but I really need your guys' help. My sister and I adopted a 3,5 month old cat, turned out she has a broken leg. She needs a surgery and it's a cost of around 1500 PLN and it's a lot for us. Even 1 zloty would mean a lot... I feel really bad for asking about money but we will do everything for this cat to have a great, normal life and even though we just adopted her, we already love her so much ♥️
Please, Zira is counting on you.

'Hey friends! I am blocking the person I am making this post about from seeing it. I have a friend who is just the sweetest person. Shes had a rough life. She lost her fiance and two children. Shes really trying to be strong but shes suffering. She had to face the hardest thing any mother could and pull the life support on her baby. We met just before this happened and I am too far to hug her... Too far to hold her. She was the first person to support my business among the midst of this time. She blows my mind. Now shes out of remission with cancer and shes back in chemo. Shes losing her hair. Shes dealing with pain and illness. Today she had a tough day where someone made her feel really bad about her appearance and the way she smells while going through chemo. Its ripping her apart. She has no real solid support system and no supportive partner. She is in a state of extreme anxiety panic and depression. I noticed in her posts shes putting herself down for not having things she needs not even having the right things to cover her hair loss not in a way where shes seeking pity or help but shes genuinely putting herself down because her self worth has plummeted My heart aches. I remember going through sickness and losing my jobs not having any support the day of my tumor removal, medicines making me sweat through my clothes, peeing myself having no clue about how to buy the right wig or wear it, the mood swings, and the lack of the will to live... I want so bad to be there for her. I remember two strangers named. A.S. and L.W. being the only twobpeople there for me. Thats how i met them total strangers who had hearts of gold and chose to be there for support. I was thinking that I would like to ask for a gift for christmas. Ill post my paypal link in the comments of this post and If you would like to donate towards this and include a message for her with your donation I would like to buy her a wig and the nessicary supplies to make this more comfortable for her and to show her she is loved and valued and that her life is precious and she deserves nice things and she deserves to smile. Ill find an artistic way to include the messages so whenever she feels consumed by loneliness she can turn to them. Thank you for reading and considering helping out! Every single penny will help ! And yes you can share this story with your friends and family and the link to my paypal and my email but the post will only be viewable by my friends because I had to block her from seeing it in the settings'"

If you have a dollar you could contribute so I could help her out a bit, that would be so amazing. I don't like to ask for money; my family taught me to never accept charity.

Edit:I should have put in that I am going to school to become a high school English teacher, much to my family's dismay, so I have been paying for school on my own since I was 18. It's been hard and I hate asking people for help, but I also am desperate at this point.

74,misc,"Hello. I'm kind of new here sadly just because I really need a kind sponsor/donor. Well to keep things short [VoiceMod](https://www.voicemod.net/) is an application that serves as a PC virtual soundboard (alternative for expensive physical soundboards) that I would like to use on Dota 2 games to entertain my team and well to have fun. There is actually a free version but very limited in features and unfortunately the feature that I need is covered within the pro version which costs 20 USD. I currently have 10 USD from my first (and currently last) commission 5 months ago as a freelance starving artist. I really do not want to spend it on this but I also would like to have something for myself this Christmas. I know it sounds absurd for me to want such expensive product despite not having resources but I really would like to have it if there is any less spendy way for me to have it. 

Please do not force yourself or feel guilty if you cannot help. I do believe it is not a primary need for me anyways just something to add some fun in my life so I'd appreciate even the slightest thoughts or wishes. Those are more than enough.

As gratitude to the sponsor, I will illustrate any character/image of your liking in my style for FREE (though I don't think my art is worth much). You can browse my account to have a general idea of my abilities and whether it is a good trade. Of course you can hire me instead if you somehow appreciate my works that will do just fine. Thank you.

You can send me a message if you have any inquiries. I don't expect much donations really but I would gladly discuss further transactions in personal messages to avoid sharing credentials. Thank you very much and happy holidays!"

I support my uncle with USD 50 per month from my salary. and sometime buy him food every evening. He cannot work since he has eye problems for the last five years. His son and daughter don't care about his father's conditions. they live abroad but rarely come to see him out, last time they came is on 2010, they don't wire some money to him at all. I don't know how to contact them since they don't have social media I tried to call them but never connect. I bought 2 hen and 1 cock for him last week.  so he can do something and maybe he could sell it after the chicken has chicks.
I desperately want to help him out more but since my parent's medical condition requires me to spend almost all my monthly salary (my salary is around USD 750 per month) for them.

So today it was brought to the attention of a local community, an elderly gentleman put a bag for life on his garden gate with a note asking for food and electricity as he had nothing. 2 local citizens arranged to meet at the property to see how they could help, on arriving they were greeted by a elderly gentleman called William, he explained that over the past year things have just got too much and couldn't cope! No electricity and No Gas heating for OVER A YEAR...........the house is freezing, infact warmer outside. Locals put £100 of his own money on the gas and electricity meter to find out that the meter hasn't been working for over a year, he spoke to the gas company and they are coming out to sort it with the next 4 hours (that was 5 hours ago). I have spoken to Local Foodbank and they are going to provide help and direction to help him but in the mean time ..................... WE NEED YOUR HELP ASAP. ITS A SHORT TERM FIX but will help somewhat in waking William and feeding him

Anyhow I figured if I can just get up some start money I can do what had given us a chance at life again, I have been fighting major depression along with mental illness and pills that make me drowsy most the time if I take them right, I need the tools to provide I did it before I was doing great had tons of tools and I always fixed everyone's stuff for a small fee. I love computers and was doing what gave us a life and a place to live and rest and have great family times, My kids were stolen from me with my exes help when I went into a mental hospital over 18 years ago for delusions and thoughts, I'm still severely depressed over my kids being taken from me but after many years of trying anything to kill the pain well it is always there no matter what it comes back sometimes harder than others but it's always there, I don't want to keep doing this it's really killing me I have to try and I have to give it one last good shot ok so I figure this is my plan any input is greatly appreciated and will be cherished: since my babies I used to tuck in at night and wake up in the morning are gone hopefully not forever that will really kill me, sand since I have mental issues and I'm severely depressed I must do something about it I can't just try to grab another mind altering drink, I believe God is letting me know it's now the time, so I want to have somewhat of a Christmas for at least my son that I haven't been in contact for over 17 long painful years, he just started talking with me but just for him to tell me he wants to do things by himself he said since it's been that way for so long, (and now is not responding to me) now obviously he doesn't know I've been searching for him and the girls for so long and took a toll on my health because of this. I need start up money to repair and refurbish and resell computers, I think somewhere around $200 to $250 start up cost, I'm very good at computers that when I was doing them I had three nice motorcycles one was a Kawasaki klr650, the other a Honda Shadow 750, and a Harley nightster 1200, and a nice impala always rebuilt and in the driveway along with a nice little apartment along with work space and space for my tools and a work bench to show for it Once people get to know me they always told everybody else that I know what I'm doing and my rates are unbeatable and the lowest anywhere and that I guaranteed everything I sold and just word of mouth put my good name out there like the plague I would have at least three computer sales a day, I older people to learn from and they like me so I like to keep my prices pretty low for everyone unless someone wanted to tip for the work or the equipment they're buying which I always said there's no need to but some you can't argue with, anyhow I would like to get some start up funds going even if some people would pitch in one dollar that dollar added to other dollars would make a world of difference for me to get what I need to repair and rebuild the computers and get the funds to try to go and see my son and pay off my license to legally drive again, I will need tools and software and money to purchase broken ones for rebuilding. I'm not going to sit on my butt any longer I'm done with the drinking although I've done it for about eighteen long sad depressing years days to where I don't even want to be here or even wake up I would always ask God to take me because the pain is just too much. I'm not going to sit and do nothing anymore I'm sick of it I  know I'm homeless but I can start now here today (there is a spot I know of that I can work around at if I ask them I'm sure) and I have to keep trying now with what I have left in my mind body and soul to get to know my kids that were wrongly taken from me and put up for adoption without my knowledge or consent while in the Looney bin WITHOUT MY CONSENT! Yes I'm homeless and don't have much at all except alot of bills, I'm sad, and suicidal, but this is insane if I keep doing and thinking the same things and I know it is. So I want to start trying right now, I want to change my situation because if not it's going to kill me, I want to feel much better than I feel and felt in the past and stop some of these meds or at least lesser doses because of side effects, I want my babies back most of all and I want them back now they are mine not hers she didn't care enough to keep and help them positively grow! I've missed them so deeply for so damn long I wouldn't know what to do if someday my hurt and pain lightened or disappeared, all I know is I can't do this anymore like I'm going because nothing good is happening the pain just comes back 100 times worse and this is my last stop im giving this situation in my life all  my energy everything I have so if anyone can help with anything at all it will be so appreciated it would be giving me the tools to help myself be successful, productive, and constructive so that I can provide so I can better  my and my kids lives, if anyone can donate at least just $1.00 it would be a blessing. $1.00 with others goes a very long way it all counts, I will keep everyone posted on what anyone donates if they wish with their name, if not requested then I will just put donated this much if anyone at all donates to my cause. This will more than likely be my very last stop here as well as in life only time will tell...

She did this for his entire life: carrying him to and from school that is far from their house, etc.

My situation is a bit complex, I'm a college student living in a low-income apartment (government subsidized housing), in a town where I have no chance of getting a job and there is no car to speak of. Nobody in the house works, and have been basically living off the kindness of others for some time now. Recently, things have changed and I'm very anxious about the future. There's a city not far away, and I want to move there with my family so I can look for a job and begin supporting myself and my family, though I am the youngest in the household. The thing is, I don't have money, any its going to be one and a half more months if not a bit over that before I get a bit less than $400 back from my college loans that I'm using to pay for school, and that's not enough to move on at all.

He is a ginger hooded, ruby-eyed rex and is approximately 1 year and 3 months old. At this moment in time, he is suffering with a severe upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and I fear it may have turned into pneumonia.

Rats are extremely prone to breathing problems and infections, - rex rats even more so.   
Without some antibiotics, Muradin will die. His breathing is laboured and he has lost weight. He's tired, barely eats and constantly comes to me for comfort. I even think he might be scared. I don't blame him. I'm scared too.

Usually, I'd be able to take him to the vet, but with Christmas coming up, all of my bills and trying to prepare for the festivities have meant that I don't have enough money to get him to the vet. I feel like an awful pet-parent, and I don't want to see him suffer or lose him entirely. He is a smart, sweet and wonderful little guy. He deserves a long life.

And I'm still not comfortable with saying everything, so let me just tell you as much as I can right now. You have no idea how many times I have thought about moving out. How many times I was crying alone in my bed. How many times I was just laying there not thinking, not moving. Not knowing what to do with myself. My ex still doesn't understand. He still thinks that the problem is with me and me only. Well, now it is. He wasn't aggressive. He never yelled. He was always speaking in a calm, soft voice. But it was even worse. First, when we moved in, he was a total disaster, he almost never did anything. I thought that I get it - he was in a sh.ty relationship before he needs time. He used to do dishes once a week and after that he was saying that he did so much while I did nothing. But you should hear him saying that. He sounded like a real knight in shining armor who was worried about me. He was so convincing. So manipulative. And I felt bad, so every fucking time I was getting to work. But I was always the one who didn't do a thing. I was always the one to blame for everything. After few months I thought that I don't really care and I stopped. I was exhausted. And guess what. Two more months after that, he started doing everything. But by then I already felt like I don't want to live there and I was wondering if I ever wanted to live at all. Every time when I was considering moving out he was changing again. We were acting like real partners again. But it never lasted for a long time. I dropped out of university 3 months after I started my masters. Few months ago my friend realised that I'm not myself. She asked me what happened to the old me. The one who took care of her health and diet. Who cared about the environment. Who read a lot of books and watched millions of movies. Who wanted to adopt a dog in few month. Who enjoyed life.I started crying. And I couldn't stop. And I didn't know. I probably still don't but I want to fight and be even better person that I used to be. I am moving out. I will live with my friend and her dogs. I have never felt so free and so empowered. I just have to wait two more weeks. But there is a problem. I will need money. My family is not supporting me at all and I can't count on them. I also don't want to ask my friend because she already helped me sooo much. I'm changing my job in a next month but December and January are going to be hard as hell. I have debts, because of this year and my stupidity. I decided to sell my laptop, so with this I will be able to pay a deposit for an apartment. But this month I earned almost nothing from my current job. And I thought that maybe I can do something here. I need to get 150$ or even better 250$ to be able to pay for everything. I was thinking that I can write personalized poems or poems with dedication. I can write personalized Christmas wishes. I can design entire Christmas cards that you can send you friends online. Whatever you want, with any theme you want (I used to be into many things, but if I don't know something I will do my research and I will do my best) Please, I feel horrible with asking for help from strangers but this is huge opportunity for me. I just need to survive 2 months with almost no money.

I'm a college student who is just completely broke. I lost access to my online banking and won't be able to get in and fix the problem until I'm home for Christmas in two weeks. Something went weird when my bank was bought out by a bigger bank, and I need to reset my login. It's been a couple months since that happened, and so I've been trying to be as careful as I could about spending money because I couldn't actually see how much I had left. Yesterday I started getting notifications from Paypal that charges that shouldn't have bounced, bounced. I went through my Paypal account history and Amazon orders and the receipts from any time I've been out somewhere and paid with my debit card, and the numbers just don't add up. I'm not sure what's going on, but there are payments that should have gone through that haven't, for two Christmas presents. One of those orders I was able to cancel, but the other I can't because it was a custom order on Etsy that has already started processing. I talked to the shop owner and it just isn't possible.

Obviously my situation isn't as dire as some of the people here. I don't need much, I just need to get a positive number in my account before I start getting overdraft fees, only about $75. $100 dollars would be great, but I don't need that much. I'll take anything. I have a job, but since it's work-study on campus, none of the money actually goes into my account, it goes directly to my tuition. I just need enough to cover the things I've already paid for that won't go through on Paypal, and I need it in the next few days. Once I get home, I have a job waiting for me.

My husband and I will be donating various items for kids to the Boys and Girls Club in our area. The Boys and Girls Club is a non-profit organization that offers lots of services including after school programs, lunch programs, shelter for homeless youth (they typically go into foster care), education programs, and so much more. This particular club seldom receives donations due to the area its in. 

Currently, this club has 50+ kids using their facilities. Many of the families are low income, and can't afford basic necessities like winter jackets and boots, or gifts for Christmas. The ages of the kids range from toddlers to teenagers and everything in between.

We've made an Amazon wish list full of toys, books, games, essentials, and other items suitable for the Club's needs. I've left the link below if anyone is interested. We can also do e-transfer (for Canadians) or PayPal.

133,basicneeds,"buckle in, folks, this one is a little bit of a long read. :/

my name is alex and i’m a 26 year old girl residing in the southwest united states. first, i’ll provide some context- i had successful surgery on my right kidney (the good kidney between the two) in late august and thought it would get me by long enough to get back on my feet after 5 weeks of unpaid medical leave from my job. fast forward to now, just a few months later, and i am undergoing treatment for my left kidney already. between the pain, constant appointments, and the heavy likelihood I will have to undergo another surgery or two, i have been forced back on to unpaid medical leave, again... for an indefinite amount of time until i can be well and functional again. I have never felt so defeated, useless, and down right broken... 

Because of this, i am swallowing my pride and finally asking for help. my partner works full time and is usually able to take care of our rent payments and all of our most important bills (utilities, internet, car insurance), and we have cancelled all unneeded subscriptions like netflix, hulu, spotify, etc. Unfortunately, we are still already beginning to struggle with gas for our car so my partner can get to work, food and household supplies, supplies for our kitties, and my medical expenses. 

below you will see i have created a wishlist for things like food, household supplies, and kitty supplies if you feel so generous as to send anything my way. 
any cash donations would be deeply appreciated and will go to gas for my partners car, my prescriptions, groceries (if needed), and upcoming procedures/appointments. this would be unbelievably helpful. i am comfortable sending any proof I have, should you request it. i’m not shy and, at this point, i will do damn near anything if it means i can keep myself and my partner afloat. 

i can also offer small tokens of appreciation/gratitude (like handmade jewelry and crocheted items, resumè creation and career/interview consulting, a sticker pack from my sticker collection, etc) for your donations. I am limited as to what i can offer as tokens (since i only have so many skills) so DM me if you have something in mind.

im a 18 y/o artist who has struggled with mental illness my entire life. my anxiety is so bad that i am unable to leave the house most days and it is keeping me from getting a job. i worked for a former Olympian (for free in exchange for knowledge) but im terrified of putting that on my resume because I left so soon due to their rudeness and abuse towards their animals. my time there made me even more afraid of working and i regularly have nightmares about my time spent there. i have made an effort to try and ignore my fears because I do not want to use my mental illness as an excuse, but it's getting so bad theres nothing i can do about it. i was receiving weekly therapy for anxiety, suicidal thoughts, trauma, ect. for about a year but quit because I was afraid to open up to my therapist. 
since i am unable to work, commissions are my only way of making any money. now that im 18 my parents no longer want to spend money on me, so I am forced to buy my own items such as clothes, things for my dog, and food because i am lactose intolerant and also have issues with textures. i am very picky. recently my old hand me down computer broke and is unable to run. i tried everything I could and asked my tech savvy boyfriend what to do and he confirmed that its 100% dead unless i take it to a shop. because my computer is broken i am unable to do commission work in exchange for money. this has greatly affected me. i am not even able to pay my monthly $3 fee from my bank. my boyfriend has been an absolute angel and does what he can to help me out, but i don't want to burden him anymore because he is also struggling. it's at the point where i have been considering becoming a sex worker to make money. my suicidal thoughts are worse then ever and the only thing keeping me from calling myself an ambulance is the money it costs and how scared i am to speak on the phone.

Earlier this year, I travelled with a friend of mine as he walked across the state of Washington to raise money for the uncompensated care fund at Seattle Children's Hospital. We raised over $175,000 to help pay bills for kids whose families struggle with payment. In short, you shouldn't have to go broke because your kid got sick. You've got enough on your plate. 

We have since made wall calendars to sell with pictures that we took during the trip. 100% of all money made goes directly to the hospital, thanks to sponsors paying for production. We recoup nothing.

My friend Lena is a full time student who usually does doordash. I say usually because even though this girl has been through a lot in life (and really, who hasnt?) The last few months have been AWFUL. The car her and her mom were using to do doordash broke down, and the car they loaned from a friend was hit by someone while they were doing doordash. They managed to scrape up enough money to get a replacement car so they can work whenever Lena isnt in class, but alas - this car is now also breaking down. 

In addition, right after the car accident they were facing homelessness because her moms ex boyfriend kicked them out so he could have a friend of his move in. They managed to scrape up enough money from doordash using the car that is now breaking down to get an apartment, and a month in they are now left with no car, no way to pay rent, and no way to keep their utilities on. 

The mom is a former CNA who was laid off by her former employer because with her physical health issues she couldnt lift the client.

146,misc,"Tldr at the bottom
Hello guys, this is actually my first post of Reddit believe it or not... I suppose a little back story is needed. About a year ago I moved out to Colorado with my husband to where his family lives. We decided to split an apartment with his sister which was mistake number 1. His sister is the youngest and a bit self involved. She's been telling his family that we've been paying rent late and just being assholes to her. We texted her and told hers she's not without fault and now she's looking to cutting the lease. 
We've been having auto problems with almost every car we have. And today when we were looking to sell the old car for scrap we found the window busted and the battery stolen. That's our fault. The other car we got to replace that one, the guy didn't tell us the radiator was bad and the heat isn't working. We live in Colorado where it's been in the 15s for the last couple of days. So now we had to borrow more to get another car. I would at a small retail store and my husband works front desk at a hotel. We're on the verge of being homeless and having to get rid of all our stuff that won't fit into our car. Everytime we think we're getting better more shit just keeps happening and honestly I'm at the end of my rope. I don't really know how any of this works but if anybody can help us get back to my family in North Carolina, anything helps. Thank you for reading 💙

TL;DR: my husband's sister in law in breaking the lease, our cars are undrivable and had to get a new one for work, and we have no money to get back to NC."

172,medical,"Hello,

I'm a college student who is on leave of absence from university because I couldn't cope with mental illnesses anymore. I came back to my parent's place, hoping I could find some time to myself to figure things out, but my life only became more depressing here...

We recently learned that my father's heart is abnormally large and only has 40% of it functioning. He also has water in his heart and lungs. On top of the expensive medicine he needs, the doctor also told us that he needs to have an [echocardiogram](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856) within two weeks. My mom explained to me that, depending on the results of the test, we would have to pay 200,000 to 1 MILLION PHP... and we don't have that much money at all...

Now, my father's condition has become the top priority in the family, while my medical needs had to take the back seat... I'm not feeling resentful about this though, because my father's condition is more critical, so I understand.

However, as the eldest child around here (since my older brother is away for university), I am suddenly thrusted with the heavy responsibility of looking after my father... which is very difficult, considering I can hardly even take care of myself...

I suffer from depression, anxiety, attention deficit disorder, and insomnia. My meds and sleeping pills have ran out, and I'm now relapsing into a dismal state, oscillating between sanity and suicidal thoughts. I feel like I'm such a terrible daughter for being so useless even when the family is going through a crisis...

**Please help me.** I don't know what to do anymore. I need to get better, not just for me, but for my family... I can't keep going on like this... I have to get my act together, but it's really difficult. I don't want to lose my father, but I'm hardly even holding on to myself... Please help. Any small amount would do.

I am an only child and between my dad we balance a job each at opposite hours and the rest of the time we are home in shifts taking care of mum.

She is somewhat able to move around and do basic tasks but suffers from aphasia, a speech disorder, confusing words, and has trouble moving around much on her own. We live on the 2nd floor and there is no elevator. Basically since coming home in 2016 my mum has left the house on two occasions since we do not own a family car, and it requires both of us to be at home to carry her down two flights of stairs and into a vehicle for a short trip nearby.

It has crumbled us financially having to keep bills paid, speech therapist & physiotherapy. Unfortunately we can no longer afford Physio or the speech therapy for that matter.

 [**paypal.me/janehelp**](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/my/profile) 

What i hope to achieve is to raise an amount high enough to move out of our current rented home & find either a smaller more economical house on either the ground floor or at least with an elevator so its more accessible for mum to be able to get out more often with us. Also we would really like to focus on physiotherapy to provide her with the help she needs be stronger on her feet and more stable.

This was my reply:

I got about halfway through. It's incredibly relatable and realistic as far as my own experiences go.

We're a household of four/five/six on ESA and pip. Basically we're one missed payment away from being in Katie's position. As a rule we don't have enough to live on anyway. Our outgoings are as low as we can make them but food bills seen like they're going up every week.

We're not at food Bank level yet, but one DWP fuckup and we'll go under in hours.

I've had to siphon money out of the rent to make ends meet before now. Our social landlord rep was blessedly really understanding about it and we only have to repay a nominal amount a week.

We can only afford Christmas because I borrowed £700 from another redditor. Repaying that loan will leave us almost penniless between Christmas Eve and New year, but that prospect is more palatable than seeing four kids, two of them not ours but ""rescued"" from unbearable and abusive family situations, go without a Christmas.

The scene where she gets caught shoplifting tampons broke me. I had to stop because I was sobbing too hard to see the screen. Tearing up just thinking about it.

That could be us, really really easily. Holding on is knife edge hard. Added to my and my so's mental and physical restrictions, it's a daily...hourly on bad days...battle to keep utter despair from overwhelming me.

Someone has to keep going though.

So yeah, I'm not going to be watching it again. I can't.

182,pets,"gofundme.com/margie-cakes Margie Cakes was found on 11/16/19 hovering against a concrete barrier on a narrow I-40 passage on the west side of the gorge near Tennessee. She was in shock from the speeding traffic so close to her and had obviously suffered trauma and in her hind legs and lacerations. She was wearing a tracking collar and it was soon discovered that she was a hunting dog running bears. The hunter tried to stuff her back into the small dog box on the back of his truck. At that point, the young ladies who had rescued her begged to take her instead. The hunters promised they would take her to a vet. The girls called the hunters phone over the next few hours to follow up concerned  that she would be put down since she was of no use to them any longer and could serve no purpose.  The hunter agreed to let them have her and confirmed their worst suspicions as to his plan for Margie. Margie was provided emergency vet treatment. She was very dehydrated and thin. She has a T11 injury and her hind legs are not working.  She suffered trauma and lacerations and shock.  Although Margie is injured and unable to walk on her own, she is finally free and happy!  She smiles and her eyes are so deep you can see inside her soul. She is grateful and loves to put her face next to yours. She is a beautiful brindle Plott Hound and a little over two years old. It appears that she will not be able to utilize her back legs again and will need a K9 cart and also to finish paying the remainder of her expenses.  She needs lots of prayers sent her way. Margie is a special dog and deserves so much better than the life she had previously living in a box with cedar chips and hardly fed, starved before hunting her prey. Even now, she looks at you as if to say “Thank you for saving me.”  Any money raised will be put toward a K9 cart to allow her to walk again and toward the remainder of her expenses going forward. Thank you in advance for any small amount to help this precious dog!"
184,basicneeds,"Hello everyone,

Due to a clerical error in the permit application process I will be forced to return to the US for three months. I will be leaving my wife and two daughters in Denmark because my wife works full time and my daughters are in school.

My family is dependent on my income to help cover many basic living expenses and my absence will create financial stressed on top of the emotional stresses of separation.

I am seeking help to ensure my family is taken care of and so my wife can afford additional child care while I'm gone.

If anyone needs proof to my claims I can of course provide it. I am a humble person and feel terrible for asking for help...but I don't know what to do.

186,bills,"Hey everyone so to make things short and not ramble.This summer I was left almost dead in a hit and run accident that left my 350z completely totaled and even though I had full coverage on the vehicle geico said they couldn’t replace anything on it because it was all aftermarket nothing was stock. It breaks my heart because that was the one thing I had to show in life no matter if I had a job or was homeless or whatever at least I had a car that I built and had won awards at all the local car shows in town. Di bought it back in highschool and it was my baby ever since. My fiancé at the time couldn’t stand the idea apparently of wasting the summer being stuck inside while I healed from fractures in my spine,shoulder,leg,ribs,and hand so she left me. Said that she shouldn’t have to take care of a grown man and that this was a sign we weren’t meant to be. It made things worse when the first two months went by and I didn’t hear from anyone of my friends and I was just alone,sad,defeated and wanting to end it all.i healed up though got a job and soon after was prompted to a team lead at the Qvc call center that shortly after I was asked to part ways from the company because I openly support the lgbtq community and I’m pansexual myself.so now here I am pawning every item I’ve ever cherished to keep paying for my apartment as well as helping my mother with a third of the mortgage. The only problem is I had to spend the couple thousand dollars I had been saving for a new car on my moms house with repairs and now I’m just trying to keep going when I feel like I should just throw in the towel on life at the moment I’m $150 behind on bills and I’m just eating pb&j sandwiches to get by till I start my new job. Guys honestly it’s hard for me to openly ask anyone for help. I’ve always hated the thought of depending or relying on anyone other than myself but guys I need any help I can get. I’m trying to save up for a cheap bicycle from walmart so I can get to and from work as well. I’m just trying to stay afloat when I’m starting to drown.

193,basicneeds,"Hello everyone 

I do not enjoy asking for help.. I feel embarrassed doing so. I am married and have three kids. This past year has been a challenging year to say the least. We’ve had to contact churches to help pay our rent. We were 700$ behind at one point, luckily that has been caught up. My husband works full time and I am part time. I stay at home during the day to take kids to school and our special needs daughter therapies. She’s still in diapers at 6 and our 1 year is too so those alone are expensive. We do not qualify for SNAP so we are absolutely struggling. My wages will be garnished here very soon because I couldn’t pay a paycheck advance loan. We are in a debt consolidation commitment because we’ve previously done bankruptcy. 

I go to food pantries a lot but a lot of the foods need to be eaten within a day, but I am grateful do not get me wrong. I would LOVE to be able to be able to go grocery shopping and purchase meals and food that will last.

All I’m asking is $5, 10$ or whatever you can help with for food. I have paypal or I can provide an amazon wishlist too. I will work on it today just have gotten discouraged because the other assistance subreddits require you do be minimum of 90 days and I’m only 65 days old. 

Anything is appreciated and I’d be forever grateful. Thank you

Now both myself and my wife work full time jobs however the trouble began when I had to take time off for the surgeries and to pay for funeral expenses, my father left everything to my stepmother who moved out of province shortly after as the will stated their estate would go to his and her children after they both passed away. At this point I had to max out and overdraw my accounts to help pay for the expenses and that of my family. I got behind on some bills and can’t seem to get back on track. I have a struck budget and am working as much as I can and still can’t tread water. I have been selling all my non essential stuff to try to help but it’s slow, I’m a musician as a hobby, my father and I used to jam, most of what I’m selling is my gear and drum kit but have had little interest as it’s not cheap and I’m trying to make the most for what I have. I’ve been barely living payday to payday somehow but am overwhelmed as I have to prioritize what bills get paid and which get put off, and now I’m behind on a few with no clue as to how to restore the balance.

222,medical,"Good day,

tl:dr I have a friend in Kansas who is having heath issues. She doesn't know where they stem from, but she has been unable to work because of them.

"" I have been very ill the last few months. It started with bronchitis and pneumonia, and that caused a cascade of other hidden ailments. I'm severely anemic, and though I was treating it, it apparently wasn't enough. It raised my iron levels, but my red blood cells are too small, so for the last year my organs have not been receiving adequate oxygen. I'm on a higher dose of iron now, but no results yet. It can take months to work, and given that treatment didn't work after a year, I may need transfusions down the road. I also found out I have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a serious form of fatty liver disease. Luckily we found it before cirrhosis set in. I'm still undergoing testing to see what else might be wrong.

Basically, I'm in pretty much constant pain, have frequent nausea, get dehydrated easily, and can't get very far away from a restroom at any given time. I'll spare you the details, but there doesn't seem to be a pattern to when an attack might occur, so I can't just plan around it. Even light housework and running errands can leave me bedridden for a day or longer. Because of this, I haven't been able to work for months and I'm not sure when I can go back.

I don't have insurance and the medical bills and regular expenses are piling up. My savings are completely dried up. Steven has been a huge help. He picks up shifts when he can, takes care of our dog, cooks, and does pretty much all the housework. Unfortunately, one income just isn't enough.

We're applying for SNAP (food stamps) and assistance for rent and utilities, but it's taking a long time, and most places will only help once in a 12-month period. Anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated.""

Anyways, there's a fella here who's wanting to provide me with more CBD to treat my epilepsy, but I need your help to make ends meet so I have the $40 a week that I need to afford the required amount of CBD to keep it in check.

Obviously there's absolutely no worries if anyone simply can't or just rather wouldn't contribute to assist, but if you would like to help (and you're in Canada), you can simply e-transfer me at [katvolver@yahoo.com](mailto:katvolver@yahoo.com).

228,medical,"Hi everyone, I've posted this in other subs, but I am hoping this will reach even more kind souls.

This is for my nephew Sam. He has a rare genetic condition called Prader-Willi syndrome. When he was born, the doctors gave him 2 years to live. He proved them wrong and turned 14 this June. It's been a struggle for him since day one, though. He can't really speak or stand/walk on his own, but he's probably the happiest teenager I've ever met.

He needs spinal surgery as soon as possible because of the severity of his scoliosis, which is starting to squeeze vital organs. The procedure isn't available in our country (Philippines), so he has to have it done in Spain (more affordable than the US!).

As you can imagine, the cost is astronomical - 80k euro for the medical fees alone. We're doing all we can to help Sam get the medical attention he needs, and if you can help in any way, we'd be filled with gratitude.

Learn more about Sam, share his story, and donate if you can via this link: [https://gogetfunding.com/i-got-sams-back-sams-spinal-surgery-fundraiser/](https://gogetfunding.com/i-got-sams-back-sams-spinal-surgery-fundraiser/). Our campaign has plateaued, and it would be awesome to get some momentum again so we can get the surgery done by January. 

Anything you can spare - financially, socially, or spiritually - would help a great deal!

Thank you from our whole family."

2015

With no past medical troubles, i came home one afternoon to find my mum red in the face passed out in her own vomit on the living room floor. I provided first aid and within the hour we were in a doctors office discussing a 10% survival and the possibility of considering organ donations. My mother had two ruptured brain aneurysm and was unlikely to survive.

Four difficult months later of ICU and therapy, miraculously she pulled through and we were home.

I am an only child and between my dad we balance a job each at opposite hours and the rest of the time we are home in shifts taking care of mum.

She is somewhat able to move around and do basic tasks but suffers from aphasia, a speech disorder, confusing words, and has trouble moving around much on her own. We live on the 2nd floor and there is no elevator. Basically since coming home in 2016 my mum has left the house on two occasions since we do not own a family car, and it requires both of us to be at home to carry her down two flights of stairs and into a vehicle for a short trip nearby.

It has crumbled us financially having to keep bills paid, speech therapist & physiotherapy. Unfortunately we can no longer afford Physio or the speech therapy for that matter.

What i hope to achieve is to raise an amount high enough to move out of our current rented home & find either a smaller more economical house on either the ground floor or at least with an elevator so its more accessible for mum to be able to get out more often with us. Also we would really like to focus on physiotherapy to provide her with the help she needs be stronger on her feet and more stable.

At this point, every little bit helps.

I ask that you never neglect the ones you care about, and if you are not feeling well, do not just shake it off, get checked out.

Bless you for taking the time to read this novel of a post!

238,pets,"Hi everyone,

I'm sorry to have to ask this, but I was hoping some of you may be able to help me out.

My sweet dog Bella, a 7 year old Otterhound mix, randomly developed epilepsy around two years ago. Because my mom did not have pet insurance at the time, we now no longer qualify due to her epilepsy being a pre-existing condition.

Bella takes medication 3x daily to help keep her seizures at bay and for the most part it works. Unfortunately a few days ago she suffered a Grand Mal seizure for a prolonged amount of time (generally they're considered very serious if they last longer than a few minutes) and we had to rush her to the emergency vet. She is now stable, but we were slammed with a $1,200 vet bill.

Between my mom and I, we can cover about $750 of the cost, and I just got paid. I'm a waitress, and don't make a whole lot of money. I don't expect the people of Reddit to willingly hand over the extra $450, but if anyone can donate anything at all, I would be SO completely appreciative. We've endured a hard few months financially for many reasons and this just happened at the worst possible time.

I don't know if I'm allowed to put my Venmo here, but I can happily offer it to anyone who may be able to help.

Thank you in advance. <3"

244,bills,"Hello everyone, I’m Fort and I’m starting a new [WordPress.com Blog](https://www.fortnovels.wordpress.com/), for posting translated works. Translating has always been my hobby, and seeing words of one language change into another always filled me with admiration. As such, I thought of starting a WordPress.com blog. I don’t remember when I first became fascinated by the concept of translating, or just languages in general. Computer or Human didn’t matter to me at that time. However, over the years I’ve realized it’s a really fun hobby, and a beneficial skill in this day and age.

Despite the paragraph above, I’m not starting this blog for the sole process of pursuing my hobby. No, I’m doing this because this is my final struggle. I have been dealing with many problems, from lack of money to pay rent that will lead to me being homeless by the 28th of this month, to dealing with stress and anxiety, and also a gallbladder stone that’ll cost me more than my kidneys to get out of my body. Haha…not that I’m willing to sell my kidneys as it’ll only cost me more in the long term.

Some might be wondering why don’t you have a job? It’s because I had to give up school in high school. Yes, you guessed it right, mental and financial problems. Mental problems are in boom nowadays.  
During the second year I became my only family, and the only breadwinner. I couldn’t handle part-time jobs that fed me and my school, and I gave up on the latter. I truly lament that choice till this day.

This and that happened, and earlier this week my landlord handed me an ultimatum. To get out or pay the overdue rent of 4 months. I had been reading novels online for some months whenever I got some free time, and saw that people could make money off of it. It was at that point I thought maybe if I can make enough to just pay the rent from a hobby of mine. Sounds impossible? Yes, even to me, as I’m writing this post, it sounds and seems impossible, and I can see my future as a sweetheart on the street with a comfy quilt just around the corner.

I know this post won’t be read by most, or even laughed at or maybe thought of as scam, or me being not serious enough. Whatever the case may be, I’m tired of living life like a zombie, working tirelessly from day to night every single day and still not making enough to pay my rent or to eat heartily whenever I want. And finally, I don’t want to give up my home as it’s the only place I’ve lived with my parents. With that as my only conviction, I’m shamelessly imploring to anyone who reads this to help me save my parent’s only memento. I don’t need a lot just $2500, but for many even that may be a lot. 

As long as I can get as little as just $1 from a person really wanting to help me, it’ll mean a lot to me. I ask to share this post through link, twitter, facebook, heck maybe even email to people.  
Sharing and spreading this post as widely as possible may restore my faith in humanity. I’ve been treated too badly to believe something as humanity.

I will be translating every single day till the 28th, which is the day I either make it or lose it. If I’m able to survive, I’ll never stop translating. And maybe, probably, I hope I’ll have enough money in a year to maybe redo my schooling years, so I can get a proper job that pays a lot and get done with my gallbladder surgery.

I'm gonna quickly sum up my story. I was admitted to a mental ward for various reasons a couple years ago and in there I became very very involved in drawing. As I got out, I was somewhere that had a PC that could do these kinds of things. It was incredible. Rendering, editing, even gaming! the whole lot. and it was my safe place. making my own creative shit.

It seems so entitled coming out of my lips and I hate myself for wondering what my mental state would be like if I could go through with what I used to cope with the worst of times.

Hello, everyone! I hope you are all having a nice day...I'll proceed to explain my situation. I need money to pay my education. My name is Daniel Hernández and I am 18 years old. I am actually studying journalism at the Arturo Michelena University located in San Diego, Carabobo, Venezuela. My country has been living an economic crisis since 2013 that resulted in what we call humanitarian crisis now. People are starving and eating from the trash and crime and corruption is at it's highest rates. I am a lucky person to have a house and a mom who loves me and takes care of me. I try my best to survive this constant tragedy with a smile on my face and good humour, but it has gotten harder and harder to live decently. I recently got a job as a salesman in a clothing store, I earn 12$ monthly. 12 eggs cost 5 dollars. So you can image how healthy I am eating. I have starved some nights. Even though this whole scenario has made me have suicidal thoughts and develop mental issues I know I, for the most part, have the honour and privilege to have food on the table I started studying the minute I graduated from high school. I am at the sixth semester of my career and I might have to stop studying because I am short of money. Every semester costs up to 20 or more dollars, here this amount is really important, it may sound nonsense but this is what hiperinflation did to our coin. It has no value at all. I also have to use private transport because I do not own a car anymore — we had to sell it — and it costs up to 3 dollars a week. I don't really want to stop studying. I cannot move out now, I don't have the money and also I don't have the documents to do it – which are very difficult to get if you don't have a lot of money – so my only hope is getting my degree and as soon as possible leave the countrt with my mom to seek for a better life...I also have been hapenning to need medicine and funding for my onthodorthic process and mentall illness, if you are interested in helping. 

If you would be able to support me with whatever you want to please contact me — Any questions you have about my situation or any proof you need to proceed and support me please let me know! Thank you so much for reading, I hope you have a nice rest of the day and may God or whoever you believe in, bless your hearts.

**Together, we are raising $50,000 to build a technology center for 1,000 underprivileged youth of the Ojibwe Tribe Boys & Girls Club on Leech Lake Reservation in Minnesota.**   
In the U.S., Native American Reservations have the most urgent need for help. Fewer than 10% of homes on tribal lands have access to internet. The Leech Lake Bank in particular struggles with high rates of alcoholism and drug use, and most of the children in the Boys & Girls Club live in extreme poverty. Only 10% of Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe children go on to higher education (compared to 29% of the general population). Our new center will provide supplies, teachers, training, and support to 1,000 kids in need, inspiring them into higher education, career paths, and greater positive impact on their Tribe.  
My personal goal is to raise $1,000 by September 30th.

But i have a classmate ( were in our first year of university) and his band ( first nations guy) is supposed to be funding his education, but will not buy him a laptop. Most of our assignments are online and he has no laptop or access to a computor outside of the school. If anyone has an extra laptop kicking around doesnt need to be fancy just wifi capable and a charging cord he could use for his studies.  His band is taking their sweet time paying his tuition, and his textbooks id like to find a way to make it easier on him as he wants to do something with his life and he is extremely intelligent.

My wife loves to run and has been hoping to run the New York Marathon for years. She's applied multiple times but has not been lucky enough to get a lottery admission. This year she decided to go the charity route and is raising money for Rising New York Road Runners, which provides free youth program and events to help kids gain confidence and healthy lifestyles.

Unfortunately, she is still more than $1000 away from her required goal of $2620 (26.2 miles, $2620). We've reached out to family and friends and held a few fundraisers so far but it doesn't seem like we'll get to the necessary amount in time. I've been saving a bit but I don't think we'll be able to pay the rest ourselves considering all the other costs associated with flights and hotels.

271,medical,"I don't really know how to go about doing this properly but I feel like I should at least try. I've never asked anyone for anything in my life, but I recently started taking welding classes about a month ago and there was someone in my class I noticed was really intelligent and hard-working and I realized this was the same guy who had been dating one of my classmates since before I graduated high school in 2008. He graduated the same year as me, has the same first name, has the same bike as me except 1000cc instead of 600cc, so I thought it all was kind of a cool coincidence.

&#x200B;

The dude busted his ass at work every day, showed up to class, is a funny dude, and has been killing it on all the tests so far. I currently only have a motorcycle so I've been riding it exclusively, which is fine because I'm used to it. Class is Monday-Thursday from 5 to 10 PM. Last Thursday he told me he was going to try and ride his bike the next day, which he did, and we ended up going for a ride on our lunch break. He told me he hadn't even rode his all year which kind of worried me because we both have really fast bikes.

&#x200B;

Anyway, we leave school and I told him I'd ride with him the way he was going but I'd be turning off at an intersection because he lives 15 minutes away from where I do. He was a good distance ahead of me on the highway and was definitely going too fast, and possibly wasn't aware of where the intersections were, but I pulled over into the left lane and started slowing down. This intersection actually has ridiculously poor visibility due to how the ground is inclined. I get a sick feeling before I even saw anything and as I pull up to it can tell the lights and scene I'm seeing aren't right at all.

&#x200B;

I see a car in the middle of the highway and a bike laying on the ground with no rider in sight. I pulled over to shoulder of right the side of the road and see the driver on his phone standing outside of his car obviously on his phone calling for help. Everything is going in slow motion for me and I'm sick to my stomach, 100% sure he is dead and I'm just standing there staring at the scene in front of me. The guy on the phone yells to me, ""can you go be with him?"" and I immediately run to the other side of the car and he's laying there on his stomach. He somehow has his flip phone open and is talking to his girlfriend on speaker and says, ""man, I'm fucked up. I'm so fucked up. Do I look fucked up? Man, please tell me if I look fucked up."" and I'm just telling him that he's going to be OK, he tells me to talk to his girlfriend (who is at the local fair with his little sister and her boyfriend) and I tell her where to go and she told me something to do with her number that I immediately forgot and didn't do. He somehow pulled his own helmet off of his head while I was talking to her.

&#x200B;

He was somehow only probably 20 feet away from the wreck, the upper half of his body on the grass and the lower half on the gravel, and his feet were laying in the road. He asked me to turn him over and I could see blood coming out from under him and figured he had an insane amount of bones broken so I told him that I'm sorry but I can't do it. A fire has somehow started on top of the hood of the car and ends up spreading quickly and I don't know exactly what could happen so I'm standing in front of him in case something blew up because I figured anything hitting him would make sure he was dead. Everything is kind of a blur but the car ended up becoming completely engulfed in flames. The local fire department, state highway patrol, and I assume what is also the fire department (green vests) are the first people to arrive, and a lady tells me to get back.

&#x200B;

The ambulance takes FOREVER to get there, as in his girlfriend who was in the middle of the fair somehow got there directly after. He was taken to a nearby hospital and life-flighted. He suffered severe pelvic damage, damage to his lower body, and a vascular surgeon managed to perform a skin graft to save his right leg. Parts of his intestines were removed and somehow reconstructed. I don't know much about the medical field. I don't know if he suffered spinal damage and I don't want to ask because I'm just hoping he will still be able to walk. His girlfriend has kept things updated on Facebook and it has gone from looking completely bleak with the first day of him being in critical condition, to going out of surgery, to having to go back into surgery.

&#x200B;

He is currently breathing on his own but there's so much stuff going on I don't even know how to explain. Everyone probably thinks we were doing stupid shit and racing but he was far ahead of me and probably just enjoying the freedom of being on a bike. Yes, it was stupid but he has a kid and a girlfriend and she's having to take off work. I have a seriously good feeling he's going to pull through though and everything will be OK in the end.

&#x200B;

I don't even know if I'm in the right place or if this is what this subreddit is for, nor do I even know how to go about organizing something to ask for donations, etc. It's a rough situation to handle and I'd like to be able to help but don't really know where to start."

Hi everyone! 

On October 5th I will be participating in 'Light the Night' sponsored by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society in order to shed light on the darkness of cancer. 

My mother recently passed away from cancer in January. Since her passing, life has been undoubtedly harder for my family and I. She was the brightness in every room that she entered and I am hoping to send a little bit of light up to her. 

By providing a small donation, you can help people like my mom who were impacted by this awful disease. The money raised through Light the Night allows the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to fund treatments for people who are suffering from all forms of blood cancer.

Help me defeat the darkness of cancer, please. Any small donation helps!

280,bills,"Right now I am in dire need of a bit of assistance with my rent. If I don’t have the full amount to them tomorrow, then I will get evicted. I have nearly everything I need but not quite. 

I’ve had a seriously tough couple of years. I lost my Mom in 2015 and I’m still having to pay to sort out probate issues with her things. I went through a bad and long (and expensive) divorce from a manipulative and frightening man after a 10 year marriage. He stole all of our savings and left me with a ton of bills. Then I had to move quickly with all my pets and belongings from a house I thought I’d raise my children in and live for the rest of my life. Luckily I found a new place to live but rent has been difficult the past two months. I didn’t have transportation at all due to an awful car accident (didn’t get anything back since it was an old 90s volvo). I recently found a decent truck to purchase and it was doing great - until it wasn’t all of a sudden - so now I’m still not even sure what the issue is (hoping it isn’t the transmission) but I had to pay to get it towed an hour back to my house. That, along with previously helping my elderly Dad out with a few necessary living expenses, has unexpectedly put me behind in my very tight budget over the past couple months. I’ve borrowed from friends and family, which has been really difficult for me and I’ve lost a lot of pride, but I had to do what I could to survive... I have loans against my 401k. Several things with the divorce process (longer story) has made my credit awful and my one credit card left is maxed and I can’t seem to get any loans. I’m not sure where else I can turn at this point… 

I am employed full time and I’ve been picking up extra hours, so I managed to pay August rent late (along with court eviction filing fees and extra late fees from my rental company). Now I am trying my best to get the September rent paid by tomorrow to prevent the eviction/lock out from proceeding. I would deeply appreciate any help at all to keep me from losing my home.

285,pets,"I hate asking for financial assistance for my own problems, but I’m desperate. Even if you don’t end up donating, maybe this can be my therapy.

This past year has been the worst in my life. I accept the consequences I’m responsible for, but there has been a pile of unforeseen, unwarranted bad situations too. I’m putting myself through law school, working a part time job that barely paid, and living independently. Finances were tough and life was stressful, but I had a couple of things in particular that kept me going: my boyfriend and my dog.

My boyfriend has supported me through so much: my depression, anxiety, stress, finances, everything and anything. My 4 yo French Bulldog, named Tato, has supported me too. He’s been my companion and a source of joy ever since I got him as a puppy. I have only 2 pictures hanging at work, and they’re of them. 

Well this past weekend, Tato has a strong reverse sneeze attack. He’s had these before, but this one was the worse it has been. He had strained himself so hard during it that he locked up and fell to his side. 

The emergency vets juggled us around, until they finally suspected a herniated disk and possible IVDD. His limbs are paralyzed. I must spoon feed him wet food and bottle him water. He eliminates in his bed because he doesn’t when we hold him up outside. 

The vet recommended and MRI and possible surgery (totaling $7K) which is scheduled for this Thursday. My friends and family have rallied to raise just under $4K, but we are still far from our goal. Even if every person donated just $1 each or shared his GoFundMe page, it would make a world of difference. 

I am still actively pursuing every avenue I can. I’m kicking myself for not getting pet insurance. I applied for Care Credit. I’m considering quitting law school to work full time again. But I’m terrified it won’t be enough and it won’t be fast enough. 

Please, if you understand how dogs can become family and a support system to you, please help Tato at GoFundMe.com/helpTato. 

TLDR; I’m about to lose my dog, who’s family to me and my life’s support. I need help paying for his medical treatment. Please 🙏🏼 (If you’re here to troll, please skip me for today. I’m in a very low place right now.)"

This is a way of looking inside the body using a flexible **tube** with a small camera on the end of it. The endoscope is **inserted** through the mouth and down the esophagus, which leads to the stomach. Which then we will pump more nutrition because he has uncontrollable spastic shakes, that just burns all the caloric intake.  


I am devastated because the doctor did give us a fair warning that since he is immobile, he is at a very high risk of infection and the worst part is, he cannot tell us if he is sick, he has never talked nor walked. His name is Aaron Mathher Hernandez he is 6 years old and wheel chaired bound, we live in South Texas, (RGV) and we need funds for  travel and other expenses. The hospital is in Houston (Texas children's hospital), where my wife and son currently are.   


I love my boy he's a happy camper but it has drained us that i gave all i had to my wife and it was not enough, this hurt extra bad, but I ain't going to let this weaken me, I was born a fighter, I have always found a way, i always will but my vision has been obstructed by thick tears. I need some Reddit love to illuminate the path so i can keep going and find a way.

287,pets,"In a video circulating Facebook, Eugenia kisses and cuddles a beautiful white and brown cat. She cleans him, dresses him in a diaper (due to urinary incontinence), and a specially designed 'cat-sack' which protects his legs when he drags himself around on the floor. This is the day-to-day norm at **Ladybug Kitty Nursery**, an independent volunteer project run out of Eugenia's own house!  Her mission is to provide temporary shelter and medical care to Romania's unwanted and abandoned cat population while they await adoption. Some of the cats are perfectly healthy, while others come to her with special needs such as blindness, amputation, FIV+, cancer, urinary incontinence, etc. Sadly, many of the issues these cats have are due to human cruelty.

&#x200B;

*How did Ladybug Kitty Nursery begin, you ask?*

&#x200B;

*It all started in 2014 when Eugenia saved a paralyzed cat that was attacked by a pack of dogs in front of her house. She had no money to see a vet, didn't even know of a vet caring enough to be trusted with such a special little cat! She realized there was no place for special needs cats to go after being rescued, so she took it into her own hands. And after this cat was adopted, others started to hear about the wonderful gift Eugenia had given it and wanted to help.*

&#x200B;

*She decided to call her project the Ladybug Kitty Nursery, in honor of that first kitty, Ladybug.*

&#x200B;

Eugenia can't do it on her own, though. She needs help! She relies heavily on donations for the things these cats need, such as litter, diapers, wipes,  cleaning supplies, cat toys, towers, pee pads, pillows, blankets, etc!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**9/10/2019 HELP NEEDED URGENTLY!**

&#x200B;

There has been an outbreak of panleukopenia at the Nursery!  5 out of the 6 kittens who showed symptoms have already passed (Mumy, John, Mina, Micu, Amy Lee).

&#x200B;

Panleukopenia is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease caused by the feline parvovirus. Kittens and unvaccinated cats are most severely affected.  THIS is why your donations are so dearly needed and appreciated, to help keep these babies healthy.  Unfortunately, due to no fault of Eugenia's (some kittens do not have up-to-date shots due to receiving antibiotics at the time, or they were underage) the virus has been allowed to spread.

&#x200B;

Every cat brought to the Nursery has tested negative for  panleukopenia, otherwise they wouldn't have been taken in, as Eugenia knows that this is an absolute nightmare for a cat fosterer. Mumy unexpectedly tested positive a few days ago and sadly has since passed. Any cats that begin to show symptoms are moved upstairs to the quarantine room where they recieve fluid therapy, antibiotics and a hyperimmune serum that has proven to be highly effective. Unfortunately, however, cats are still dying.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Right now the cats at Ladybug Kitty Nursery need your help more than ever.  There are vet bills that need to be paid, air purifiers that they desperately need, as well as stainless steel food bowls, etc.  Essentially anything these cats have come into contact with needs to be destroyed. Eugenia is hard at work sanitizing everything that can be salvaged.

&#x200B;

Any and all donations are tremendously appreciated! After all, don't forget this is an independent project run from Eugenia's own house! She's doing the best she can, but she needs our support!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are several ways you can help:

&#x200B;

This means I need a car. I want to buy a used car with cash so i no longer have payments to worry about.

This is very time sensitive, as my car will be repo’d soon, i fear. PLEASE help.

I've been overweight my whole life. Over the years I've developed multiple conditions such as; diabetes, severe sleep apnea, depression, social anxiety, PCOS, diabetic neuropathy in my feet and hands, diabetic issues with my eyes that require injections in both eyes every 10 weeks or I could go blind, mulitiple herinated discs in my lower back that has made it difficult to stand or walk, I'm also on 15 different medications, etc. I'm 27 years old and I've never really had friends. I've never had a boyfriend. I've never really felt loved at all. I can't work so money is tight, and I'm still trying to get disability. I'm tired of being sick and lonely. I'm tired of feeling ugly and unwanted. I just want to be normal. I want to be able to work, have my own place, be in a relationship, and most of all have kids. So I'm just asking for help, this surgery will save my life. Anything you could give would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions please feel free to message me.

302,misc,"My brother is 23, autistic, and living with our parents.  In the next three months or so our parents are planning to move to Georgia (we live in Florida) and they intend for my brother to go with them.  He absolutely does not want to go, our dad travels a lot for work and often is away for long periods of time, which would mean he would usually be stuck at home with our mom.  She’s narcissistic and controlling, and over the past few years her behavior has taken a serious toll on my brother’s mental health.  He feels stressed and depressed much of the time, and an environment where it would only be him and our mother at home for long stretches of time would, we both think, have a very negative impact on him.

He does have a job, but he rarely gets scheduled despite being part time.  He gets one shift every week or two, and hasn’t had much luck in picking up from his coworkers.  He’s trying to save up money so he can afford an apartment with some roommates, but currently only has about $400 to his name (a lot of which goes toward his car payments + insurance).  I’m also trying to help him financially here and there when I can, but I’m also in the midst of moving apartments and am transitioning jobs at the moment.  He’s hoping to have at least $1,500 saved up by the time our parents are ready to leave, but he’s extremely worried that if things don’t work out with his job that he might not make it.  It’s this desperation that led to him letting me make this post in the first place; usually he doesn’t like taking from strangers.

If you are willing to donate his venmo and cashapp are both under ChaosHero236.  I really don’t want to see my brother be forced to leave his job and friends and home, so any little bit helps.  Thank you."

My boyfriend, James, and I have been dating this time around for a year now, but our story starts 12 years ago. We dated briefly way back when we met in grade 8. Immaturity, timing and bad decision-making left us going our separate ways, but little did we know we both considered each other our soul mates all these years. We completely lost contact, but fast forward to a year ago, we ran into each other at the grocery store. We both couldn’t believe who was standing in front of us (you could see it on our faces) and rambled on about where we were in our lives and updated each other a bit, and then parted ways again. That day started a whirlwind of emotions in both of us, and we began messaging and opening up about how we never forgot each other and hoped to one day be brought back together again. And here we are! He literally treats me like a princess, and I’ve never known a human who better intertwines with everything I am. We love all the same things (including, but not limited to: french-press coffee first thing in the morning, going metal detecting, doing trash clean-ups in the streets, painting, tending to our garden, cooking, hiking, camping and having bonfires, looking at the constellations etc). James has high functioning aspergers, and he makes me proud every single day. For example, he just filed a bullying report about a coworker of his that he witnessed bullying another coworker, who, James thinks is on the autism spectrum because of certain behavioural cues. He didn’t stand for it at all, and immediately reported it. I’m not only proud of who he is, but proud to be his girlfriend. He makes every day count, and reminds me to not take life so seriously. To put this into perspective, a regular grocery store trip just to grab bread is easily turned into a big fun fest with me - and strangers within earshot - literally in hysterics because he has no filter (he is an aspie after-all) and he’s the most hilarious person I know. He makes a positive impact on everyone he meets, I’m sure of it. But I’m here to ask for your help. He gives so much, and I want to be able to give back to him! I’m a student with a part-time minimum wage job, and he is a full-time minimum-wage worker. We definitely have enough money to be content and live comfortably for now, but I don’t have anywhere near enough to splurge on anything to spoil him on his birthday for being such a wonderful human (on my birthday he bought me a beautiful opal promise ring - how can I top that?!). So his birthday is coming up and I want to surprise him with a really amazing telescope! A specific one he has mentioned is the Celestron Nexstar 8SE which are $1,500. He’ll tell anyone who will listen about his passion for stars and planets and owning a really good telescope one day. When he talks about it his whole face lights up, and I just want to be the one to open him up to that whole new world through the lens of a telescope. When the night sky is clear, you’ll see us out on our front deck with his binoculars, trying to get a closer look at the stars and the moon - but I want to give him better than that! Please help me make his dreams come true :)"

[You can check the program's website here](https://compro.mum.edu/)

However, the money needed to sign up for the program is usually $3500-$7000, **but with this special offer I only need to pay 2000$** (plus another 2000$ for personal use when I am there since I won't have any way of getting money when I am there till I get a part-time job or something) My family cannot afford the fees, they are barely feeding us and getting the necessities we need since they are both deaf and mute so it's harder for them to work than normal people, and as a practicing Muslim, I cannot take out the kinds of loans with interest that are usually offered to students, because charging or paying interest is not allowed in our faith. I’m asking for your help with $2000 of those fees.

I have worked hard in university for 3 years just to get an opportunity like this! This is my chance to build a bright future for myself and my family. It has been my dream to study abroad, and money is the only thing keeping me from following that dream now.

Edit: some people here might think that my post has no meaning and other people should get attention while I don't deserve it because my campaign is stupid, I just wanted to mention this, maybe you don't know how it is to be in a poor family, here in Algeria it's so hard to find a job even if you do, you won't be able to keep up with the monthly expenses especially for my parents and they really did everything for me, I want to at least repay some of their kindness before they pass away and I want to relieve them of their stress and help them out, they are growing old and they won't be able to work anymore so it's up to me as the older son to help my family and I really can't do that in Algeria, I need to finish my studies abroad and get a decent job so I can help them with everything I can, I am not asking for a lot, **if each person here donated 1$ it would mean a lot to me, it will just take 2000 people donating** but even if it doesn't at least the small money I gathered might bring me close to my goal, if you don't like this post or think it's stupid just ignore it please \^\^

I\`d like to set up a private animation studio that will be involved in the production of animated media. I will conceive products to produce, own the physical equipment for production, employ operators for that equipment, and hold a major stake in the sales or rentals of their animation works.

The pilot project of my animation studio will be to create animated and explainer civic education videos that will reach the ordinary man and woman. This is because I have seen that most people are unaware of their basic civil, human and fundamental rights in my country.

I\`d like to combine civic education with short animation videos to reach many people and make them aware of their rights and obligations as a citizen of my country, as well as other important matters for example, matters that are of public interest and affect them directly such as changes in law, regulations and other things that they might not have otherwise been informed.

My objective is to build a world class animation studio that will be known to produce top – notch animation contents and to become the number one choice for TV and online platforms.

If you have any questions or clarifications, please PM me.

341,misc,"To all the generous members of this sub-reddit,

I am a 30-year-old guy from Pakistan. I've been working as a freelance web content writer from home for the past 11-12 years. Presently, I am primarily supporting my household, which includes my parents. There have been a lot of ups and downs in my life, perhaps even some highs, but somehow I've managed to help make ends meet.

Shortly before April though, I wound up losing a major source of my income. So, I decided to invest some money into my own blog/website, for which I had to purchase a domain and web hosting. I was fairly certain and hopeful that I'd finally manage to earn a decent monthly income, while also creating something of my own.

Unfortunately, I haven't managed to earn anything feasible from it. Yet, I haven't given up hope and am working hard on getting it off the group. My blog/website is just 3 months old, so I am still hopeful and positive that this venture will eventually prove to be fruitful. I am also an author and I've published some erotica, but it isn't too lucrative yet either.

Getting to the point though. I know this may sound bad and wrong, but for my own personal reasons, I had to lie to my parents and I've claimed that I've managed to earn $1,200 over the course of the past 2 months or so. It may not make sense why to you, but although I'm the one earning, my father handles the household budgeting and financing.

Hence, considering that I do not have $1,200, I now find myself in a crisis. Once again, it is too complicated to explain, but my parents will flip if they discover that I do not have the money I claim to, which will lead to dire circumstances. Consequently, I've been experiencing tremendous anxiety and depression since the past week or so. I don't mean to exaggerate or gain unfair sympathies but I've been feeling a bit suicidal because I feel like my world is collapsing around me, which may end up being true.

The reason I decided to state all of the above is to explicity present my current situation and why I decided to post here, and also for the sake of utmost transparency. I know that there are probably far more deserving causes and charities that deserve attention and monetary assistance. I never imagined that I'd find myself in a situation like this, but I'm utterly desperate and panicking.

TL;DR: I am in desperate need of coming up anywhere between **$800** and **$1,200** within the next few days. I know this practically impossible, but this is kind of my last resort, so I thought I'd give it a try, in any case.

The money I receive is supposed to go towards my household expenses and rent for the month of August 2019. This is somewhat unrelated, but my father was recently diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes, so I need to begin saving money for his surgery as well. If manage to get through this crisis and raise enough money, I have vowed to turn my life around and secure a more stable source of income.

As I am in Pakistan, I cannot create a GoFundMe at the moment, but I will ask a friend of mine in the U.S. to do so. Once again, I know it is probably impossible to raise **$1,200** within 3 to 4 days but if anyone here might be generous enough to contribute any sort of amount in order to get me out of this predicament, here is the PayPal email of the same friend: roswell250@hotmail.com

To anyone who decides to help me out, I will be forever be grateful and obliged. I may not be able to pay you back, perhaps, but I promise to pay it forward some day. While it is not mandatory, if anyone does decide to transfer an amount, it would be helpful if you could leave a comment below and mention the amount. That way I could inform my friend and above all, thank you for your contribution.

I'm not a big time drug user, I've done it just a couple of times and offcourse I got scared imediatly. I gave them what I have and for that I got 450€ penalty + 30€ for paperwork.

The reason I lost my phone is because I've been homeless for a hot minute, and it got busted up in May. I haven't had the funds to pay the insurance deductible, yet. I've been staying at a Mountain Sanctuary, and they're willing to let me use their mailing address while I'm here, but I only have until this Friday (07/19) before they're asking me to leave so there is room for new guests. Once I place the insurance claim, the phone is shipped over night. So I really only have today to finish trying to raise the money.

Thank you for reading.

**TL;DR : I'm $20 short on getting my phone replaced. Getting the funds is time sensitive, because I won't have a mailing address after Friday. If you have anything you could donate,** [HERE is the link.](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8gvrYBYIuS)"

I have until Thursday to come up with a significant amount of money as Friday I'm due in eviction court. My two roommates decided to move out on me right before Christmas, leaving me to pay 2/3 more of rent that I was not expecting to pay and due to the Holiday did not have in the bank. I've notified my landlord about the situation, and they don't care (its a business obviously and I get it). I've been denied for loans online, pawned of what I could and I still find myself searching the couch cushions for change in tears . i have contacted 211 but based on my income I was overqualified for rent assistance. Then I heard of St. Vincent and found a local office. So mainly the point of the post is just to ask if anyone has used them before and know the rules/qualifications. I checked out their website and saw something about a month wait.. Does anyone know if that's accurate? Or of any other organizations that may be able to help in a more prompt way?"

Short story on why I'm requesting. My husband is the bread winner, and he has always got us by just fine,( family of 6 ) but his work slowed down and he's making less than half of what he normally does. Pay checks have always been an inconsistent amount just because he gets paid for whatever job he does, individually, but the amount he's been getting isn't enough to live off of and it is catching up to us really fast!  Work is slowing picking back up ( he is looking for a better paying job with a SET pay right now) but that isn't going to help us at the moment! I do market research and surveys online right now to try and help, I'm almost to the 25 dollar limit to cash out on my app, but it is going to take a couple days to get there ( you only get a couple surveys a day)  and then up to 3 days for a posted payment. My husband just applied for a small loan threw his retirement to help us out of the hole this has put us in, but that could take weeks. We paid our rent and 1 other bill ( couldn't pay my car insurance because the money just isn't there) and we literally have no money left at ALL!

It's a dream job and it kind of just fell into my lap. Because I wasn't expecting to switch jobs I didn't have enough money for the gap in pay checks so I overdrew my bank account and I've been trying (with a little success) to get ahead. A couple days ago I got a letter from the bank letting me know if I don't pay off my overdrafts in 14 days they will be going to collections and I really do not want that to happen. I was overdrawn about $700 but I've managed to get it down to $350. I do still have bills coming in so that also makes it hard to keep my account positive when a big chunk of my checks are going to paying off the overdraft but $350 will just about cover it. I know it's quite a bit of money but anything helps and I would be so so grateful if anyone could help me.

I hate asking here but I had the money set aside for this, but yesterday I went into anaphylaxis and had to go to the hospital and I got myself some food after and had to pay to get home.

I've usually been able to get enough, but I'm having trouble today. I would really appreciate it if someone could send $2.56 so I can stay at Denny's without worry.

395,basicneeds,"I guess I just need to get this off my chest and maybe get some kind words and a bit of advice.

I got home from work on Friday to find that my girlfriend had gone, packed all her stuff and just left. I'd had suspicions that she'd been cheating on me, but as yet I don't know whether that is or isn't the case as to why shes left me. She'd left a letter saying she didn't love me anymore. We had a joint bank account, my pay that went in on Friday was completely cleared out leaving me with nothing.

Over the weekend I've applied for a new bank account, so I can tell my work to pay me into this bank account going forward but I just can't believe someone I loved and thought loved me would screw me over like this. I don't even have the money for my bus fares to work next week so it's gonna mess me up financially in the longer term too.

Aside from the bank situation what else do I need to do? She didn't leave her house key, I guess I should change the locks when I have the money to do so? What about until then? What happens if she tries to come into my house? I don't want to see her at all, I'm so hurt. Also foodbanks, can anyone just turn up to them? I've had a look in my area and the one I can find is open on Tuesdays and Thursdays but doesnt specify if you can just walk in?

Does anyone have any suggestions on sites/things that can be done to try and make at least my bus fare? I'm a member of Qmee, where you can take surveys and cash out any amount but weekends are slow and so far I've only made 11p. I just dont know what to do.

I guess I also just want to hear from others that have maybe been in similar situations that things will get better? That even though I feel like my world is falling apart now, that I'll be okay. Because right now I don't feel like I will be."

I recently switched jobs and had to go four weeks without a check. This coming week is the last week of being broke but I can’t make it. I spent all my money, maxed out all my credit cards, had to take my dog to the vet unexpectedly and borrowed as much as I could. This weekend I tried skipping a meal a day but that’s just giving me a horrible headache. There’s no way I’m going to be able to work all week without more food, it’s a physically demanding job. I’d be more embarrassed to beg like this if I wasn’t so hungry as I type this.

414,pets,"Hi, this is my cat named Buurtpoes, which means Neighbourhood Cat! She is a stray that my boyfriend and I took in after we found her roaming the streets around his neighbour (hence the name, and naming credits to my boyfriend’s little sister). We decided to take her in and she’s been with us about half a year now.

However, she has gotten very sick. She first got sick a few weeks back and we took her to the vet as we were concerned. They thought she might be stressed due to us recently having moved, gave her the appropriate medication, and we thought that was that. But then, a week later, she got sick again but worse this time. We took her to a vet again but as they were unsure what it could be, they gave her another set of medication and treatments, along with blood work and a specific diet. But she did not improve and has only gotten worse. 

Our vet has now recommended to us for her to see a specialist, starting of with a scan for which a specialist needs to come into their clinic to perform, that will need to be followed up with possible surgery or special consultations through a specialist clinic. Along, of course, with more medication and treatments. Our vet told us that for merely the scan, it would already be a cost of £250,- without any added costs of the actual appointment or treatments. We’re already £450,- into medical bills and are at a loss of what to do.

We care about our cat very much, so as a hopeful resort we turn to reddit. If you are able to, donating a just a few pounds would help us out immensely. If you aren’t able to, just sharing this post would mean a lot. Thank you for reading this.

- one of my housemates was hospitalized after an accident and is currently unable to work as a result and the medical bills are expensive. (I don't know how much, I would have to ask)
- we are currently down a car (see: accident) so the one housemate needs to take Ubers and Lyfts to get anywhere since the rest of us are unable to a majority of the time. That car is still in impound on a 600 plus bond (more by the day)
- I currently am unable to work due to my mental health and therefore unable to contribute to rent or much else of anything other than helping around the house 
- that being said, we have been having struggles meeting the needed amount every month. Collectively speaking it costs over 2.5 grand and it's common for us to be up to $300-400 short.
- we barely have any food in the house because none of us can afford to buy groceries or even spare a fast food place anymore. There are four of us and all of us are declining in weight, and it's especially alarming for me because I'm already dangerously low as far as that goes.
- one of my housemates has a major surgery coming up and, since the deposit has already been put down and has been on a waiting list for years now, it cannot be postponed. Whatever doesn't go to rent is prioritized to go towards that since the deadline is fast approaching.
- the other day we had to pay upwards $1000 because our power got shut off and our water is about to be shut off too but we cannot afford to pay it. We don't know how we're going to pay rent now. 
- we aren't able to pay for our medications half the time even though collectively only ends up being about $20, it's still sometimes nothing we can do for.

We are in a really really rough patch right now and could use all the support that you are willing or able to give. Of course there is absolutely no obligation, but any donations would be greatly considered. Every penny counts. If wanted, I also do art commissions if they are requested.

436,misc,"Well.. I do HVAC work in florida.
During this time of year work is scarce.. its neither hot nor cold.
I was offered to start monday doing a different job in the field that would pay almost as twice as much as I've been making. Mainly because ive only been getting 20 hours a week lately ..
It's been a rough year for me. I broke my hip..had surgery.. all the follow up visits I complained about my knee not my hip so six months after the surgery finally the doctor listened to me.. I had been doing rehab and then working for 6 months with a torn meniscus and partially torn acl.

Well finally recovered from that financially and physically.. then christmas came.. I have 3 kids..one is mine..the other 2 are my wives from a previous relationship..guy beat her..was a drug addict..died from an overdose..I love them like they are my own though.
Kids aged 2 (mine) 5 and 6. 
So we did our best to get them a nice christmas with help of their grandparents but it set me way behind.
While driving home from work a few nights ago..I thought I'd ran out of gas..
My brother came and towed me in...

After spending the last bit of money I had on gas..turns out it wasnt even that.
The alternator went out on my truck.

A few days before I'm about to take on this new job with much better pay that would enable me to take care of my family..
Me and her have been not eating much just to feed the kids.
My phone has been turned off for almost a month now.
My wife's kids grandparents paid to keep our internet and buy the kids a lot of materialistic stuff that money could be better spent on.
This entire month the day I get my paycheck I have had an anxiety attack. Because I know just to feed the kids and keep the lights on..I'll have to give up my entire check..
My main fear right now would be the fact I havent been able to pay my car insurance and in florida that gets your license suspended.

But my truck wont even work and I'm supposed to start this new job mon or Tuesday.

So I would ask anyone that can please help me buy this part to fix my truck so I can get to my new job.

The cost is around 100 to 150 dollars.

I've tried everything..I used to collect comics and only had a few left..put them for sale online at a price cheaper than I paid for them. But no one is bitting.

My parents and I dont speak. I was raised by my grandparents and dropped out of college to take care of then as they passed away both slowly and painfully.

Know it sounds like a sob story maybe but I can prove it all. 

It just sucks to work as hard as I have breaking my body..and now my mind to try to take care of these children.
I also have PTSD from the experience with my grandparents and horrible anxiety...I have been off my medication for a month and a half now because of work being so slow and trying to give my kids a decent christmas.

But I cant lose this job.... if anyone can help every little bit matters. 
Please dm if you can help.

God bless you and this sub for even giving me a chance to make this post.

Sincerely 
Justin."
437,misc,"Hi all,

Anything will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you in advance."
438,loan,"This is long...

My Ma is a sweet, sweet woman. She has survived a couple of abusive relationships and come out the other side still so nice and generous. She got herself in to debt through decisions made when she was married to my stepdad, an arrogant, feckless, coward who would spend a large portion of his salary on beer and cigarettes and then force my mum to go and ask friends and family to borrow money, and also I to borrow money from banks. This lack of money meant she got behind on her rent and council tax (we’re in the UK). These past few years she managed to work herself to being debt free through working hard at her job and being very careful with her money. 

At the end of 2018 her car was starting to become more and more prone to breaking down, which is not good as she works an hour drive from her home and there’s no public transport to get her there. She did some research and saw that she could take a loan to buy a new one from her bank. She borrowed £10,000, with the intention of buying a new, reliable car, and paying off other debts.

My brother’s girlfriend (I’m not sure how much his role is in this but certainly she was the main player and is, in my opinion, a nasty piece of work - she treats her kids like shit for a start, smokes in the house and in the car with them, swears at them, and generally cannot wait to get someone else to look after them.) was around when my mum took the loan. Now, my brother’s girlfriend used to have a business selling computers which was actually a way to exploit a tax loophole. It’s not something I fully understand. But until not long before the end of 2018 she was earning A LOT of money. Honestly, i was impressed, and amazed that someone like my brother and his girlfriend would be quite so smart and proactive. It wasn’t necessarily easy, so I hear, as took time and effort to build up. However, as 2018 came to a close, the money stopped coming. At first the story was that the Inland Revenue (tax office in the U.K.) had found an erroneous paper, which the girlfriend had filed “by accident” and was actually not a completed transaction. So the Inland Revenue wanted to check everything that had been filed by my brother’s girlfriend (she did the paperwork). I guess you can see where this is going. Now she swore that there was nothing else, it was an accident. And my Mum, sweet as she is believed her. There’s also the fact that my brother’s girlfriend had helped my Ma a few times when she had trouble with money. And the kids of my brother and his girlfriend (they’re so. Damned. Sweet!). Of course my Ma does not want to see them suffer because their parents are going through some difficulties! So the girlfriend asks my Ma if she can borrow a few hundred pounds for bills, and will pay it back when the Inland Revenue completes it’s investigation and releases the money they supposedly owe my brother’s girlfriend. Then it’s a few hundred to fix her car. Then Christmas presents. Over the course of three months the girlfriend borrows £6000 of the money my Ma has borrowed (if you’re wondering, my Ma has little time as she leaves for work at 10am and returns at 8pm weekdays, and often works Saturdays too, plus she was working any overtime available, and this left little time for car shopping - she did try a couple out). How it got so far I don’t know. When I ask her she says “I can’t see my grandkids suffer” and “she says she’ll pay me back”. Of course it has now transpired that the girlfriend was committing tax fraud, submitting fake receipts in with the real ones to boost her income. Now my brother’s and his girlfriend’s relationship has broken down it has transpired that also a lot of their “business” income was actually borrowed money, money which he is paying back and leaves him with nothing to help pay back my Ma.

Now my Ma is saddled with paying back a £10,000 loan which she never really got to see the benefit of.

I send her money each month to pay off what I owe her as she helped me too, over the past few years, and I’m now in a situation where I can pay her back. But she still is working full time, and because her main job has cut back on overtime, she is working a second job as a cleaner and is looking for a third. My Ma has been through so much in her life, and suffered so much at the hands of people who were supposed to love and protect her, as well as been taken advantage of by people who saw her kindness as weakness. I wish I could do more, but there is no option for me apart from to send her what I don’t spend on myself each month but it’s not much after rent and bills (and I live a minimal lifestyle - I cycle everywhere rather than taking public transport, rarely go out, don’t buy the most expensive food, exercise at home rather than going to the gym, I even take my own coffee out rather than buying it).

If there’s anyone out there who can help in ANY way, it would be very much appreciated!

Thanks for you time,

Rob"

440,pets,"Need $50 fuel money to get my sisters assistance dog to the vet/hospital..Wanna start by saying I don’t like asking for anything on the internet but I don’t having any other options at the moment. Anyway I’ll start with some backstory. so my sister who has muscular dystrophy, is also diagnosed with depression and anxiety. she has an assistance dog, his name is Pluto he’s a blue heeler and the most precious dog alive. he first came into the family for training so he would be able to assist my sister with her difficulties caused by her muscular dystrophy. but soon after my sister was diagnosed with depression and made an attempt to take her own life that’s when Pluto stepped up and took on more responsibilities. She got put on suicide watch and Pluto was trained to alert us when she was in bad moods, was hurting herself and even if she made an attempt to take her own life. Pluto has saved her life on 2 occasions by alerting us that she’s harmed herself. Which made us able to call emergency services in time to save her. But anyway that’s enough backstory, so I’m sure most of you are well aware that Australia (where we live) has been having horrific bushfires lately which we are somewhat caught in the middle off. we went travelling to NSW to see family for the holidays and are still stuck here due to fires and insufficient funds to get back. I’m only a casual with full time hours at my job so I don’t get any money until I start back at work which I haven’t been able too cos I’m in a different state. So the property we’re staying at belongs to my great aunties who is kind enough to let us stay with her even after her property and portions of her house have been burnt by the fires. Pluto is a very curious dog when he’s not working or is aloud time to play and muck around and the back of the property we’re staying at is a large shed which was luckily pretty much untouched by the fires that hit a week and a bit ago. So Pluto was playing around the shed this morning when it collapsed on top off him due to the structural integrity failing after the fires it took us 3 hours to find him in the mess his left legs are completely broken and he hasn’t been able to do anything really for the past 6-7 hours I urgently want to get him to some sort of treatment but the nearest vet/hospital but the 70km at the least and it’s only me and my sister here for the next 3 days and me being completely broke and her being an unemployed 15yo isn’t helping much. I’m sorry if none of this makes sense I’m pretty stressed and emotional right now and don’t even know if this makes sense or why I’m doing it but I hope someone can help in some way even just keeping Pluto in your thoughts is all I ask for thanks :)"

444,basicneeds,"So some of you my remember my previous posts about how my finance and i were about to be homeless, well now we are and last night really put things to the test. As we were checking out of the hotel yesterday morning we had to leave roughly half of what we owned behind because we couldn't carry it all and this was mostly clothes. But we were ok with it because we had the essentials because a few weeks back some friends gave us each a fairly decent used coat they had laying around to which we were incredibly grateful. Well last night we got caught in a really horrible rain storm and that pretty much ruined the rest of our stuff inclusing the jacket they gave her because we have no where to wash anything on short notice. We really just need a room for the night to regroup and warm up so that tomorrow I can go to people ready (basically a day labor agency) to start making some money to get us out of this whole. The cheapest one around is the motel 6 at $55.60 a night I know it's asking for a lot but if anyone could help we would so so much appreciate it.

448,medical,"Hi everyone. I am embarrassed and ashamed that I have to make this request but my situation is desperate. TL;DR at the end.

I (33F) I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder at 14 years old and have been living with a severe spinal cord injury and degenerative disc disease (C3, C4, C5, C6, C7 vertebrae) since the age of 15. Some days are better than others but none of them are ever without pain, most of them I am completely immobilized. The medicines I need require seeing my doctor quarterly, and if I cannot make my appt at 9am(PST) Monday morning I will have to be hospitalized.

Because of these injuries and illnesses I am unable to work “normal” jobs and have had to make due with odd jobs for friends and acquaintances who understand my physical and mental limitations. This has never been a negative experience until after I met and worked for Cailey(name changed for privacy). 

Cailey is a very successful jeweler and social media “influencer” who I met about a year ago. We quickly became friends and bonded over our struggles with mental illness (she has Borderline Personality Disorder) and our sobriety from alcohol. I am a huge believer in shedding the stigmas around mental health struggles and accepted her with open arms, thinking I understood what BPD was. Within a few months I had stayed with her 24/7 during suicidal episodes, helped her successfully flee a severely abusive relationship, took her to the hospital after she was raped on a tinder date, sat beside her every moment of the exam, rape kit and police questioning, helped her navigate her victims assistance claim, accompanied her to meet with the victims advocate, found and attended support groups with her, and held her while she cried after being diagnosed with an incurable STD, and more. She then offered me a position as her Jewelers Assistant. $20/hr to work and learn the trade, handle correspondence, package items for shipping, and run her social media so she could finish items. She even told me to count the time that I spent walking her dog, doing laundry, and cooking for her (which I never did because we were also friends and I wanted to do those things out of the goodness of my heart and also not rack up more money than she could afford to pay me) This went well for a couple months. It seemed like the perfect situation for the both of us. 

Then she made the conscious decision to “try drinking in moderation” which was extremely unsuccessful for her. I continued to work for her until the end of that month. When I calculated my hours, because she left me to work while she went out to party, it added up to A LOT of money. Knowing that it would overwhelm her I decided to add some extra deductions to what she owed me. I took $250 off towards her power bill, $550 off for half the rent (even though she didn’t ask me to) and submitted my hours to her. As we had done in the past, I told her it’s fine to get it to me in payments. At that point she moved studios and stopped contacting me for work saying she could only afford volunteers. She would send me a couple hundred dollars when I begged her to because I needed to see my doctor or fill my prescriptions. The last time she sent me anything was October 12th. I checked in periodically letting her know I was still waiting for the remainder and she said she’d pay me when she had some money. 

This brings us to a few days ago. She had a sale for her most recent collection and according to the website she’s made in excess of $2500. I waited a day or two to see if she would send me anything and when I realized my appointment was coming up and she wasn’t taking the initiative, I sent her a message asking her to please send me at least $250 of the $438 she still owes. 
Explaining that I need $170 for the appointment and $80 for my scripts. 

Cailey sent me a message back claiming that I lied about my hours (which were meticulous itemized), that she never approved me working that much (which is a bold faced lie, remember that she wanted me to charge her for hours I spent helping with anything, not just jewelery work) and that she wouldn’t be paying me anything more and that she hopes we can end this amicably. She then blocked me on all platforms, including my phone number.

I don’t know what to do. Small claims is an option but that doesn’t help me access my healthcare. And even though I would win in court, she is self employed, so there is nothing to garnish. 

Is anyone out there can help me, I am willing to trade digital art/logo designs, and my eternal gratitude. 

At minimum I need to see the doctor which is $170. The prescriptions are an additional $80 but worst case scenario I can figure that out after the appointment. 

TL;DR I worked for someone who now refuses to finish paying me what they owe me. I was counting on that money to see my specialist for my spinal cord injury and declining mental health. I am disabled and desperate for some kind soul(s) to help me access my healthcare. This is literally life and death."

450,basicneeds,"Quickest overview I can give: I suffered from an extreme mental health crisis in May 2019, was hospitalized and fired from my job while there because i was unable to inform them why I was gone. I've been job searching for half a year now, with *no luck*, somehow, and am honest to god running out of places I can even apply to in my area. I lived off my savings until November-ish, when I officially ran out..... and at the same time, the new regulations caused me to get cut off from food stamps.

And today, I was officially rejected from receiving unemployment, because apparently psychosis isn't a ""clear"" reason for being unable to work or call in. I literally have $1 to my name right now. 

My roommates are covering as much as they can, but money is tight. So tight that I'm crying over the $2 to wash my clothes at the laundry mat. And I'm out of meds.

I hate asking for help. I hate it. That's why I waited to the last dollar to ask,,, But getting that official rejection for UI, sitting in the only semi-clean clothes I have, and staring at my calendar reminder to refill my meds..... I need help. And i need it bad,,, 

My meds are $39. If any of you have any money to spare..... I would be so, so thankful. Any money at all could help though, even just $2 so I can wash my clothes...... even that much would be amazing,,,,"

# Short version:

All of my weird lifelong symptoms heightened and crashed together over the last three years (following a major death in my life and moving to Atlanta) resulting in medical leave from work starting June 2019 which used to be paid but is now $0 while dealing with appeals (though only 70% if it's approved.)

 I don't anticipate being able to return to work until April or May depending on recovery from removing lipedema. Insurance is not covering the very medically necessary surgeries, totaling **$35,500**. I also have recurring fees for supplements recommended by my doctors (and some out of network doc visits) that legitimately make a difference in my health. (I've tried not taking them for a while to see what happens and my body just starts malfunctioning even more.)

My other conditions include lymphedema, dysautonomia, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hypermobile-EDS), Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), sleep apnea, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. While the last three are mental, they exacerbate the physical disorders. I believe these disorders are in my genetics due to ancestral trauma and my own.

&#x200B;

# Details:

My biggest medical expenses are 3-4\* surgeries for lipedema which are not covered by insurance because the insurance codes for the disorder won't be implemented in the US until at least 2021 but likely 2025.

[About Lipedema - aka Painful Fat Syndrome (Lipedema Project)](https://lipedemaproject.org/about-lipedema/)

**Lipedema is a painful fat disorder that essentially sends lipedema fat (different in cell structure, physical appearance, cause, and behavior than diet/lifestyle or 'normal' fat) through the lymphatic system to the limbs (typically starting with the lower legs going up.) The areas are usually painful to the touch in varying degrees and can become debilitating as it progresses the disease to obesity.**

**Lipedema fat CANNOT be lost through diet or exercise. Lipedema fat strangles the lymphatic, nervous, and circulatory systems. Conservative treatments merely attempt prevent the spread of the disorder and treat symptoms. However, lipedema often spreads regardless of treatment through estrogen-based events such as puberty, pregnancy, and even menopause.**

Waterjet-assisted liposuction is a lymph-sparing procedure specially designed for lipedema. It is NOT a cosmetic procedure. It is done under local anesthesia and is extremely painful.

\* -- I'm delaying the fourth surgery until it becomes painful/necessary, but lipedema can spread in the untreated area\[s\] even faster if other areas have had lipedema removed. The final surgery would be $8,300. I've had doctors in Germany confirm via emailed photos that I definitely have lipedema in this area.)

&#x200B;

# Results of Surgeries (so far):

Since my first surgery alone (lower legs), my physical therapy sessions have improved dramatically. My balance, gait, and overall mobility have become much better than expected. My legs have full feeling now (sometimes more than I'd like -- tables hurt.) **AND my fat no longer hurts to the touch!!!** It used to hurt to be poked or squeezed!! I thought everyone felt this until a rheumatologist explained it was NOT normal. (Guys never understood why my body would hurt so much during.... intimate moments. I just figured they were being too rough.) In contrast, my arms -- which have not been done yet -- internally screamed in pain when I got a tight hug from a friend recently.

I make it very known on private lipedema forums that surgery was one of the best decisions of my life, regardless of the debt.

# Insurance, wtf?

Most US insurance companies are in class action lawsuits because they keep arguing this is cosmetic, especially due to the lack of insurance codes, yet in spite of pre-cert letters and peer-to-peer discussions with my doctor. (Ironically, Aetna lists the procedure as the main medical way to rid of lipedema on their website... under cosmetic surgery.) I'm doing my best to appeal in the meantime.

However... I can't entirely blame them. Really. The World Health Organization essentially publishes all insurance codes it adds to a system called ICD-##. We are currently on ICD-10 and ICD-11 will come out in 2021. Part of the ICD-11 has been published for preview and includes lipedema (not the surgery though as far as I can find), however until this is fully published, insurance companies cannot use the codes.

Each country has its own department that handles their domestic interpretation of codes. Germany has had lipedema codes available for several years (including lipedema stages, which ICD-11 will lack) as an addition to their own system, but that system cannot be used anywhere but Germany.

The CDC and CMS manage the diagnostic and procedure codes, respectively. The CDC is not expected to fully implement ICD-11 until at least 2025.

&#x200B;

# How am I giving back and how you can help non-monetarily!

* Demographics for lipedema are severely lacking. A small study was run in 2013 in Germany stating the demographics are: 11% of women and two men. Not 2%, two men. No racial breakdowns. No cis/trans breakdowns, which scares me tremendously for MtF transfolx given the disease's reaction to estrogen (and possibly other hormones, we don't know enough yet.)
* I have developed my own survey that will run for the next few months gathering demographics and other medical history to try to establish trends for new researchers to explore without having to deal with university red tape. (I am keeping the data anonymous when publishing results.) I have already gathered 552 responses in one month.
* I plan on using this data to promote not only knowledge of the disorder but knowledge of the medical and research industries' absolute failure to get any reasonable research or promotion of this disease that's been known since Mayo Clinic discovered it 80 years ago. SO many patients (including myself) have come to doctors with nearly anorexic abdomens with disproportionately large and fatty limbs and are told to just lose weight and that it's all our fault. SO many patients are fooled into following diet and exercise trends which can actually harm our lymphatic systems and produce more lipedema. SO many patients on private lipedema forums are suffering from mental abuse from their spouses, friends, family members, coworkers, superiors -- whoever wants to shame them for something that is not their fault. **Ultimately, my goal would be to partner with someone like Jameela Jamil to make sure when someone goes to the doctor with lipedema, it's as easy to spot as someone with psoriasis, and it's treated with actual DIGNITY.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* My lipedema demographics survey is available here: [https://forms.gle/KM3wMJTWLMnoft956](https://forms.gle/KM3wMJTWLMnoft956)
* If you believe you or someone you know has lipedema, please fill this out/share to them. I am particularly interested in the underrepresented groups: WOC (particularly black and hispanic/Latina), men, and transfolx of any gender identity.
* I currently do not need data from people who do not believe they have lipedema.
* There is a privacy statement available on the first page that I take extremely seriously.

&#x200B;

If you can't donate, please share just for the sheer fact that people need to know more about lipedema, EDS, and dysautonomia. These conditions often go together and are often tied to traumatic events in family history or a patient's own life.

453,pets,"We already have two kitties, not expecting to get another one but me and my wife walked to our local target next to the highway and heard meowing, in the bushes next to the highway we found a very very very skinny low energy cat, looked like it was dying, so we took her in our garage (didn't want to mix with our cats yet) we don't know if she had diseases/fleas, etc. Also she had been declawed so no chance of survival.

In the garage, I  built her a nice warm bed gave her food, water and next day took her to the shelter where they advised us if we want to keep her (which we did because she asked for our help) it was better to take her to a vet.

At the vet they told us she needed a lot of vaccines as soon as she gained a little weight, she was 3 pounds and is 1 year old.

We need to get her spayed as well and of course,e we were not looking to spend this money but of course, we wanted to help her! On Sunday she is allowed to come inside our home with our kitties.

If you want to help us out that would be amazing, in return, I will send you a printed photograph of the cat as soon as she looks healthy and gains some weight.

455,pets,"My cat Thumper has something wrong, we aren't sure what, but she's been limping with her hind legs, and doesn't want to move around a lot. I noticed this yesterday, so we called an made an appointment this morning. We took her to the vet, admittedly not the vet we usually go to, but they didn't have any spots open ay our usual vet, and we didn't want to wait for her to be seen. They did a brief exam, and noticed she has a bit of a fever, but couldn't find any initial reason for her behavior. Here's where it gets expensive, and where the wonderful people of Reddit come in.

Plain and simple, instead of doing the bloodwork and x-ray they wanted to do, we had to settle for just getting her some pain meds and antibiotics because the bloodwork/x-ray combo was going to cost over $600, which we VERY much do not have. The only reason we could even afford to get her meds is because my brother offered to pay for them.

We're already in a tight spot financially, our house is being foreclosed on, and we've been sinking pretty much every dime we have into renovations to be able to sell our house and move to Texas (where my sister and her family live). One of our cars took a shit so we're down to an 18 year old car with transmission issues (that we clearly also cannot afford to fix).

Today my thesis supervisor told me that I need to hand everything in by next Friday, when the original deadline was the end of the month, because he's taking a holiday.

I still need more than 100 respondants on my thesis survey and I tried everything, from survey sharing platforms to asking people on Facebook, but I did not manage in time. I already asked this subreddit last week when things did not look as bad as they do now. I basically have 1-2 days to collect more than 100 answers. I am really scared and worried I won't managed, and that's why I asked the help from this amazing community.

I would appreciate if you could share the survey and possibly do it, it's for everyone and if you get lucky you can win a 20 euro gift card when everything's over.

Long story shortened- Hubby was unexpectedly laid off three days after Christmas, and I'm disabled and can't work... We're both dealing with PTSD, crippling anxiety and depression, and suicidal ideation. Going to therapy, just got on new meds, we're on medicaid and food stamps and in the process of getting on unemployment benefits. (They told us that best case, we would have benefits by the end of the third week of January.) He's had a few interviews this week, but if we don't have $110 in the bank by Friday the 17th then we'll lose our car. He just spiraled into an out-of-body panic attack this morning when I tried to encourage him to go to the day labor place, and I had to call the crisis line again... Please, please help us if you can. We're fighting so hard to keep going, but we just keep getting kicked back down....




Long story Long- We are both 25, together for 10 years. We were both raised by narcissist abusers, and have recently been diagnosed with PTSD from that. This past May, things because so dangerous, living with my parents, that we packed everything we could into our tiny Chevy Spark and drove halfway across America to escape them. We have no one out here, we had to cut off the absolute entirety of our families to escape safely. He tried and tried to get work, but kept having to quit because of his mental health, until we just had a full blown breakdown. At that point we were helped, given food stamps and medical insurance, and got a therapist through a charity service. We've been seeing her individually since August, and she's made a big difference for us. We just got on medication this Monday- I'm now on blood pressure meds to keep my body from freaking out with my anxiety, he's on a strong anti-psychotic. It's *that* new to us, that his psychiatrist suspects he could have schizophrenia, so he's still very upset about that.... 

I'm physically disabled and cannot work, not to mention the disabling PTSD on top of it all... I just feel so helpless and trapped, and he's doing his best but can't always push past a breakdown. After he got laid off, we called the people we have our car loan through, and they proceeded to chew us all the way out and threaten to take our car, because we were one payment behind already and had a payment plan set up.... They now want $110/week until it's paid up. I don't know what to do... 

We're very frugal people anyway, we live in a 300sqft studio and don't ever go out, I don't know how much more we can tighten our belts. We now live in the Midwest, spitting distance to the Canadian border. It's been consistently in the negatives lately, I've never felt a cold like this. If we lose our car, we lose it all... It's rural up here, no public transportation, no income to afford ubers, no way to get to our therapist or any new work without our car... Please, if you can, please help. We're trying so hard, but still feel so lost...

First let me reiterate how thankful I am. Everything has arrived except for the USB wall chargers and not a day goes by that my life isn't improved by your generosity. I found myself smiling at random points throughout the day, which is very new for a depressive type like me.  

The smiles lasted about a day and a half.  

The following Monday someone from Guardian Asset Management (a HUD contractor) showed up with two cops and it looked like I was going to have to vacate the building then and there. HUD has sent people twice, but they didn't take possession of the house when they found out I was living there. But December 10th, while I was in the hospital, Guardian broke in, changed the locks, screwed the windows shut, stole some of my property and vandalized other property. Not sure why they did that this time, the contractor *may* have exceeded HUD's mandate. Nevertheless the place is legally theirs now, however ill acquired it may have been.

When I got out of the hospital, I was able to gain access (no comment as to how), and we've been just missing each other in terms of when we are at the house. Until Monday when as I said there was a semi dramatic interaction between us and the police. The police seemed inclined to throw me out, but last minute the contractor frustratedly said something like ""OK, look I'll call my boss and tell him someone is still living there, I don't know what'll happen... Maybe ten days, maybe less.."" and gave me a number to call the company, then left. Cops advised I contact a lawyer instead of calling the company myself.  

Not great timing as there is forecasted to be a coldfront coming late next week where lows will be in the 10s for quite a few days in a row. That was already going to be hard to manage with a roof over my head.

That's where things sit now. The week has been insanely busy, and I only make outgoing calls via google voice when I have a spot of wifi access, so I've only made around 8 calls to organizations that may provide legal aid. No luck. I've two more to make, one to a general advice line that's always busy and probably won't lead to representation, and one where I can leave a message at what seems like quite some latency.  

All of your gifts are still just as useful as before. I have a storage unit for the time being where I can store things I'm not carrying. I hope karma returns your generosity tenfold. This time I just need prayers, if you're the praying type. Sorry for the long and maybe disordered post, I don't converse regularly and I may have lost touch with my communication skills."

Let me explain: we became homeless just after Christmas last year (2019) and are now living in emergency accommodation whilst the council (local authority) decide what to do with us.

The emergency accommodation is just a single room for the three of us to live in.

It can't continue, so we have [this GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-us-reunite-our-family-buzz-bear) set up in order to hopefully allow us to get a place of our own and to also be reunited with our two beautiful cats, Buzz and Bear (you can see a picture of them on our GoFundMe page), who we haven't seen since May 2019 and who have been in foster care since.

Since May 2019 we have been staying with friends and family but they can no longer accommodate us, hence our current predicament.

We are in talks with the council to find us housing, who told us that we could have to stay living in this single room for three years, or perhaps even longer (this is the average for most families) and that they ""probably wouldn't get around to reviewing our case for about one year"".  That would certainly not only destroy our mental health, but more importantly the room simply isn't suitable for our baby to grow up in as he has no personal, safe space that we can let him play in, either.

Please help us to reunite our family and to rebuild our lives.

494,medical,"Hi Everyone,

For complete transparency, I learned about Reddit while I was starting up a GoFundMe for my third round of IVF (please note I’ve never done a GoFundMe before, and our previous IVF costs were fully paid by ourselves - as it should be). Reddit is a recommended site on GoFundMe for promoting a campaign. So naturally, I joined Reddit when I learned this information.

My husband and I have already tried (and paid for) the process twice. We were blessed with a pregnancy by our single achieved blastocyst. Unfortunately, we had a tragic outcome to that pregnancy at 36 weeks. Our fertility clinic has offered us new protocols to try, so we are looking to begin our next round soon (we have our consultation booked for February 13).

When I joined Reddit, I was hoping to find a place to reach a large number of people, in hopes that we could have more support (whether in the form of financial contributions, prayers, sharing our campaign, or well wishes - all are most welcome). However, in the last couple of weeks I have actually been quite surprised by the communities I have joined on here... of special interest to me are communities related to child loss and IVF. I’ve been fortunate to have some very good interactions with people who can understand my circumstances, and the support from those communities has really helped me see that we are not alone on this journey.

Of course I hope that by sharing this on here it will help our Fertility Campaign grow financially, but I also believe that we can also benefit through the positivity sent our way via well-wishes and prayers. Any support you can provide is much appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my message. If you are able to support in any way, I don’t know how I can thank you - other than to say thank you so very much.

Here is the link to my campaign:

My savings is exhausted due to a wreck (not my fault) and a new battery needed in the replacement car immediately after I purchased it.

Ever since finding this thread and a few others like povertyfinance and eatinghealthyonabudget (or something like that) I've taken all of those things into account and am HOPEFULLY better prepared for next month.Right now I am struggling. Last August I had to get a new vehicle because my old one crapped out on me. I bought used with the 10-20$ I had been saving each month. Things were going fine until this month. Wisconsin's weather isn't great to begin with but turns out my new (to me) vehicle doesn't like it and it needs to be fixed, which is going to be around 278$ for the parts. (Dad said he would help me fix it myself, which likely means that he will end up doing it)I am disabled and get SSI/SSD on the 1st and 3rd of each month. I am on the waiting list for S8 and have been for 2 years now. I finally paid off the small amount of debt I had left after selling my old car to a friend for parts, but my credit still isn't good enough (nor do I have the income) to get a loan from my bank. Over half of my monthly income goes towards rent alone.On top of that our building got a new landlord. While I got my rent check in on time, she's still charging me a 25$ late fee for having it in after office hours. (There's a box to drop rent checks into) The last manager of the buildings was polite, understanding, and as long as it was in by midnight the night of the 3rd she counted it as on time.I've asked for help from Leaven too many times and they won't help me anymore. My mom is out of the country until summer and a technophobe so she can't/won't wire me anything, and my dad and his wife are living paycheck to paycheck due to having to care for my drug abusing step-sister's 4 children in their 2 bedroom house.I feel like I've exhausted all of the resources I have and am coming here as a last resort.

A few people on here have been so great to help me out. Between needing clothes for work, period products, and needing a few things when I move out, people have just really pulled through on here in ways that I never really expected. Not only has their help been with physical items, but with having people to talk to. Having adults that understand my situation (I'm officially emancipated from my abusive parents and am moving out tomorrow!) and being emotionally supporting means everything to me. I know I can talk to my friends about things, but there are some conversations that are better to have with adults if that makes sense. I've really met some fantastic people through this sub and even made some new family members!

I can't thank everyone enough for your kindness. I have all of my absolute necessities right now, and I'm starting to get a real plan on how to manage the next few years of my life. People have sent me budgeting advice, lists of things I didn't even realize I would need I move out, and so many encouraging words. Thank you so much everyone. I love you :)

Also, if you have the time, could you please go through my lists and tell me anything that I will need in the future that I don't have on my lists? I would appreciate it so much! Some things are more expensive than they will be at other stores, but it's mostly so I know what colors and styles of things I like. It's also to give me a general idea of what I should be paying for certain things and how much I should save for my future :)

We All Have an X-Chromosome has been working since February to do what we can to be a voice for intersectional feminism. Being intersectional also means we have to tell stories and share information for not only feminist issues but any type of issue regarding LGBTQA+, race, financial inequity, etc.

The startup of this podcast came completely out of pocket due to a well-timed tax return, but bills are due. The first thing is the website. Due to our needs for the podcast, our hosting bill is due on January 13th. That is $300.00. This pays for the full year and all of the various business aspects we need and use for the website.

Look, we don't have sponsors banging on our doors. If we did, we'd be very particular on what we would bring onto the show because we don't want our editorial process hindered because a sponsor doesn't want something. We have a loyal set of listeners and the better we are funded the more we can do. Our podcast family has gone through trials and tribulations that have caused personal financial strain. Yet this is something that we do because we feel it is a benefit for society and hope our friends and allies agree with that.

The $300 is the immediate need, but anything beyond that will go for the next set of bills we have to pay (which hopefully there would be my tax return so I don't have to do much about it).

On Oct. 21 I and one other driver were Tboned by a Denver Police Officer. We had a green light when all of a sudden the officer hit the car next to me, the car next to me was then slammed into me. Our cars were span about 45 degrees  the police car ended up on the opposite side of the intersection. 

  The driver next to me wasn’t injured I however wasn’t so lucky. My medical history is very extensive I have some extremely rare medical conditions one that causes tumors to grow on my nerves and other organs called Neurofibromatosis. Another that is a rare spinal defect called Tethered Cord Syndrome. The tumors have invaded my spinal cord I can prove this to anyone that wants the back up. I can also prove the tethered cord. In 2018 I had to undergo radiation therapy in a last ditch effort to avoid an extensive surgery that would involve removing vertebrae, and the muscle around my spine to get the tumors out because they are growing in the spinal canal. As you can imagine the tumors in them self are very, very painful. The radiation did not stop the growth of the tumors, it in fact made them grow even more now I’m looking at being forced into surgery because the pain from the tumors has changed causing the pain to shoot into my groin and legs. Since the accident my hip and spine have been in a lot more pain we were hit at no less then 30 (or right about) miles an hour. 


Because it was a Police Officer that hit us I am having to go through a lengthy legal battle to even have my medical bills payed by the city of Denver. The car repairs came to 2,738.00.  As you can imagine by the medical issues I face on a daily basis it requires a lot of doctor appointments and I can’t rely on the bus because a lot of times the appointments come up last minute like the one I had with urology last week which I found out about less then a day in advance.  I also need the car to get to my part time job and back living in Denver is very expensive and I don’t have family, or friends that live close that I can rely on for a ride.   If you can find any extra little bit of money to help me fix the car I will find a way to pay it forward in the future.   If  you would like any proof of the things I have said don’t hesitate to ask I’ll happily 
send it. 

Edit I only had liability at the time of the crash before this car I drove junk to make things worse it was the car growing up I always told myself I would get one day.  I got it in mid June.  The insurance is my fault I’ll own up to that but the health issues didn’t help cloud my thinking I was distracted by those and didn’t think about going over my policy. 

After finding out my tumors had not stopped growing and the radiation hadn’t helped having a car to get out and drive somewhere to be alone and think gave me a a way to not let all of the negative energy build inside. Driving somewhere scenic was a move way to just decompress. 
Asking for this help is hard I feel bad having to ask but this coupled with my medical issues is just too much for me.

The gofundme link lists everything that had happened to her for the past few months, but to paraphrase what happened, my friend needs financial assistance for this month so she can find a full time job. She used to work as an assistant for a class that had special needs kids, and one of those kids attacked her one day, fracturing her legs.

Since then, she has had other jobs, but due to her legs swelling up, she was let go from her other jobs. Her son has special needs and can not attend classes for more than 3 hours, until his IEP is setup in 4 weeks, meaning that until then she can not work full time as she will be attending to her son after those 3 hours.

She is getting documents setup to work for Lyft and uber, as all the other jobs she applied for have not gotten back to herz nor has her applications for government assistance. So even small donations for gas money will go a long way.

Again, her gofundme is more detailed on what she went through and why she needs the assistance, so if you do have the time please read it! Thank you for taking the time to read my post, and I hope you all have a great day/night!"

541,bills,"Have been maintaining myself and my mother since I was 22. At the time she worked part time as a cashier. Those funds paid groceries and went to grandma while I paid for EVERYTHING else. She was fired from her part time job for repeatedly showing up late. This was 3.5 years ago. Since then she has not looked for new work or filed unemployment. At the time I gave my mother access to my cards and account so she could pay my bills and buy groceries while I worked in the AMs and went to school in the PMs since she was home all day. To this day she still has my cards and access to my online banking accounts.  She also sent what little money I had in my savings to my grandmother to help her out.

I opened a hidden account where I work and had been saving up for almost a year so that I could get away/ move when my lease is up, but I had to have emergency back surgery in September, and had to use that money I'd saved for copays, an xray, an MRI, medicine, and paying some bills while I was out of work recovering. Some of my bills ended up going late which further compounded my financial issues with late fees and interests. Both my mother and my medical costs have ruined my credit so I cannot get a loan.

I was able to save up enough to cover the app fee and the deposit on the new apt so they could hold it for me, but they require the ($160) pet deposit AND 1st month's rent ($690) before they can give me the keys on the 24th and I won't be able to come up with it because I have only $54 left in my bank account. I am absolutely beyond desperate and have no one I can ask for help. The only friend I have is a coworker who can only help me by moving some of my stuff in her car. My family are all on my mother's side and they basically think I am a piece of shit for ""throwing my mom out on the street"" but no one questions why she has not worked or studied a single day in 3.5 years.

I can provide proof of EVERYTHING... my medical costs, the fact that I work full time plus whatever overtime I can, the new apt costs, and what I have already paid for. EVERYTHING. I really just need someone to help me get the hell away from my mother so I can try to piece my life back together. Thanks to her I am in debt, my cards are maxed, and I lost the support system I had in friends and family. I now suffer from clinical depression and PTSD, and am basically falling apart financially, mentally, emotionally, and even physically.

The new place I need to get into is smaller and $150 cheaper that where I am now. It's close to my current job so I can walk/take the bus ( I don't have a car.) And is owned by the same company that owns where I am right now so even though my credit is bad they approved me because I've always paid them well. They just want me to pay on January 24th (my move in date) instead of on February 1st.

I know the total I need is steep, and I don't quite know how this kind of help works here but I am willing to accept ANY amount that anyone is willing to help me with towards that total, and again, I can provide proofs.

543,misc,"Hi, I'm not sure how to format this so here goes:

My gran walked in to the hospital a few weeks ago with a pain in her stomach, two weeks later she had surgery for pancreatic cancer.  They got it all, they said, without needing to cut away her stomach or other areas.  She recovered nicely for a few days in hospital so they sent her home to stay with her niece.  In the night, she developed massive bloodclots in both of her lungs.  She died on Christmas Morning from a double pulmonary embolism.

I had had a bad dream the night before she died and posted it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/efkt0e/angie_u_fkin_hick/).  The last time that I saw her was three years ago at my brother's wedding. We took [goofy photos together.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/emvxmp/me_with_my_role_model_from_brothers_wedding_photo/)

We always met near oceans somehow and would hold hands and dip our toes in, even during a hurricane.  She took an interest in me, even though she was my grandfather's second wife and so no real obligation to love me, you know?  She loved me though, and she made a point to be a fantastic role model for me.  Before there was Marie Kondo, there was my GrAnn who used to always ask me:  ""Do you love it?  If you don't just absolutely love it, don't bring it home. "" \*She was referring to clothes shopping, but that advice is true on so many levels.

I have never asked for help online before but the swiftness of her passing, she had a diagnosis, a surgery and passed away all in the span of less than two months.... combined with my own issues this year:  I had a stroke in May and a pulmonary embolism in October as well as a diagnosis of Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APLS) which basically means my blood is too thick and can be fatal.....  I just don't have any options other than asking for help.

Currently  I do not have any cash or assets to sell in order to make it to her 'celebration of life' memorial across the country in two weeks time.  I really would love to go so I thought I would try to ask here and see if there would be any kind souls willing to basically pay  my way home to Texas (Houston) and back.  I would also need some assistance for a hotel room for a night.  I sure hope this finds the right person.

I have paypal and I have bitcoin or other crypto payment addresses I am not sure how this works if I post my info on to the post or if I use direct messages?

Well, thanks for reading.  I just got out of hospital yesterday, my guts had literally got all twisted from continuous weeping and crying which resulted in something called cyclical vomiting syndrome.  When I think that I will miss this memorial service (It's an annual Chinese New Year party she threw every year) I start to well up inside so I am posting here and hoping for help.

My GrAnn was not religious she was someone who followed her heart and believed in the power of love.  We both loved the same things, red hearts, elephants, sparkles, bright colors.  I felt like her daughter and I think she felt the motherly tenderness for me too.  Every year she threw a Chinese New Year party, so her family decide to continue her tradition and have a memorial celebration of life.  I want to go.  I would mean a lot to me

&#x200B;

What I want to do is to give her a letter.  When my grandfather died I wrote down all the things I had ever wanted to say to him (he was quite stoic, a business man and engineer )  Since he was in the military, he was presented with a folded flag at his funeral which my gran took with her.  I had slipped the letter into the flag unknowingly thinking it would be buried with him.  She must have read that letter and I would like to deliver a eulogy or letter or some sort of tribute to her as well.  It is really important to me and I do not know where to turn to for help so I thought I would try here.  I had made a point to tell her in writing how I felt but I still have some things left unsaid.

Please message me if you would like to help via paypal or crypto

I would be more than happy to send an original piece of artwork to any kind-hearted assisting souls who would like one.  It would be an honor to thank you in this way.

Now it hasn’t happened and they keep charging extra money for a bill that was payed off months ago. In November they shut off my internet because, get this, I payed ahead and instead of applying it a month ahead they just lowered my monthly payments. After discussing this with them they said it was all resolved. Then double charged me for 235 in December. Once I payed off the late payment I then payed off my next months payment, so the one for January, and they are now shutting off my internet again and are now asking for 217 and I just can’t. Me and my wife make just enough to pay all our bills and have some leftover to save and this has been bleeding us dry. I had heard ATT was the worst company but this is just unreal.

Seems like things are a like a snowball, get one bad time that just rolls bigger. And regardless of the tolls or scammers I will keep trying everything I can including writing this post.

To the point, I been in a bad spot for awhile now , having a hard time getting work and have lived off of my credit which is totally shot now from me and helping my grandmother and uncle and family as both died in 2018. I have done some odds and ends and sold all I can leaving only a couple things on eBay one of which is my grandfather’s antique flag which seems my price is too much and hard to find buyers I need to come up with a little over $400 for  for the winter, and other immediate things,  and I have a Gofundme on another sub for a less  immediate thing at the moment.I can not get a loan as well I’m being sued from just about all my credit cards, I can’t use the borrow sub here as who wants to lend money to someone without the promise of repayment. My family is limited and have nothing to help. I have been doing surveys and signup for pays but that’s not cutting it however does help with small things. I was unable to get unemployment, disability gave me a run around for my issues. So lol I’m just up the Creek and really need a paddle. I have no friends no social media and have posted my gofundme on a sub here but that has gone no where.  

I try, but know it is not very hopeful to get anywhere.( but trying to stay positive ) If you want to sit here and tell me to get a job...I’m trying, if you want to belittle me for being out of work so long then please just move on, I really have had enough of comments telling me I’m wrong for being in a bad spot, really don’t need it.

547,pets,"Past monday, a relative who knows Im a vet student brought home a severly injured dove he found on the street. Someone shot the poor bird right in the inner part of the wing, and it was bleeding a lot. I tried to do my best with few materials I had at home (since I don't live there anymore, it's my family home and I'm studying in another city). Dove has been eating, drinking and pooping well, however I couldn't prevent the infection and condition is now very poor. We've been to the vet a couple of times now and the dove is under several antibiotic and anti-ifflamatory treatments, and will most likely need a surgery to remove its wing. I'm paying everything because I know there's hope for this little bird, but I'm just a student and any help would be amazing.
For most people a dove is just that, a simple, unimportant animal that doesn't deserve this much attention, but I just couldn't leave It like that, already knowing I could do something. It deserves to live, too.

554,pets,"Yesterday I noticed a bump and infection on my Syrian hamster’s bottom. I have no idea if it’s a tumor or what but I know he’s in pain and he really needs to see the vet tomorrow. The closest exotic vet near me costs $70 just to see him. I have no money and no options right now which is why I’m here. I know I may lose him, but I won’t know if he has to be put down until I see a vet. All I’m asking for is some help in paying for the appointment. Seriously, any little bit would help.. I’m not sure what I should do to receive money, I have paypal but I’m not sure if that’s okay with some people. [This] (https://www.instagram.com/p/B5thyItFljh/?igshid=juv1z8sn2alc)is what he looks like, he really is my baby and is irreplaceable. I just want to make sure he’s okay, and if not, I don’t want him to suffer. Thank you for reading."

I've taken it to other places, and have recieved similar quotes. I'm a single mother with a 4 year old son, and driving with a shotty heater is the last thing I want to do. If there is anyway anyone can help, you would be a godsend. I'm a working single mother on limited income, so any help would be greatly appreciated!"
556,misc,"I'm opening up an online clothes shop that sells anime apparel. A question that I can't get answered is, do I NEED a license to sell apparel that has people from anime (Example: A shirt w/ a character from the anime on it).  I've read different things that you do need a license, that you don't, and I just want to get a clear answer. I don't want to sell any apparel if I'll get stopped by the producer/creator even though the show has ended. If I do, where do I go or apply for a license to use the characters I want to in my designs?"
557,basicneeds,I have posted previously that my grandfather who for all intents and purposes is my god given father- had a heart attack resulting in triple bypass surgery a few weeks back. I have been taking care of him in his home until yesterday when he had a stroke and deteriorated his condition further to now being on life support. He is in a very good hospital an hour away from our home. I do not have the means to keep up with gas to travel back and forth and if his condition should change I'd be an entire hour away before I could get to him. I stayed in the hospital last night dozing in and out of sleep but I desperately need to get real rest while not having to go all the way back home and spending money I don't have on gas. I will stay nearby if it means staying in the parking garage-I have brought blankets and hand warmers as that's the most likely scenario. I just need one night to close my eyes for a bit and still be closeby. If just a few people can donate even 5$ each I can get a cheap motel room on the same block. With the money I have to spare I only need 35$ more to be able to secure a room so if there is any kindness left out there and you are able to help even in the slightest please comment or PM me. Thank you.

560,bills,"Hey guys, this is embarrassing to speak about but, I thought maybe speaking about it would help me clear my head to think things through more thoroughly or something. I don’t know but, I’m a 26 year old who lives with my mother who has been living with Lupus and has not been able to work for about 9-10 years now and a younger brother who hasn’t had a job in 3 months. I work a high stressed office job in NYC. I get paid crap for all the unreasonable things I get asked to do, it’s another stress in my life that I have but, I cannot afford to lose it since I am the only person who works. Currently I have my mother crying hysterically because she received a call from our landlord about us owing 12K in rent. I’ve been paying as much as I can as often as I can but, this isn’t cutting it. I’ve spoken to my brother about getting a job and have seen him actually trying everyday to get a job but, nothing seems to going out way. Today has really been a bummer. With all the bills I have to pay alone while taking care of my mother and brother. I have had mental breakdowns constantly and have had some serious serious depressing. But, I wake up everyday look at my mom’s face and think to myself that I have to keep pushing but right now, I feel like I’ve hit my limit and don’t know where to go, who to talk to or what I should even do at this point. I need serious help. I need help figuring out who/what I can go to for help or guidance. I tried calling my landlord but they don’t answer any of my calls. I will continue to try to reach out to them to speak to them about something I can do to not be homeless. I can barely find enough money to buy basic necessities (toilet paper, toothpaste, food, etc.) because all of my bills plus the rent.  I thought I’d speak here on this platform to try and just get this off of my chest. But, please, if anyone knows who or where I can go for help please let me know as I am literally on my last straw and don’t know what to do."
561,pets,"My current foster dog Will is AMAZING. He’s never met a stranger, and even though he’s 4, he acts like a total puppy (I have to take him on at least one extra walk a day to keep him from driving my resident pup totally insane with his attempts to play). Overall, Will's an all-around Very Good Boy, who’s gonna make some family deliriously happy and constantly entertained. And, ya know, he’s [bananas handsome.](https://imgur.com/gallery/HikZsPG)

But after TWO MONTHS of fucking around with a vet who just kept giving him antibiotics for a UTI for blood in his urine, he finally got to see a new vet who did a full work-up and diagnosed him with a huge-ass bladder stone that’s getting removed tomorrow, at significant expense to Waggytail Rescue (which is also dealing with at least one other major surgical issue, and typically has at least one or two surprise heartworm diagnoses to treat). 

So if you can [throw a few bucks to Waggytail](https://www.waggytailrescue.org/donate) to help Will & his friends, that would be amazing. They’re a legit 501(c)(3) charity, and their 2018 financials show that juuuuust shy of [PDF warning] [95% of expenses in 2018](https://3f6fd405-5984-47fa-8153-e694a808e665.filesusr.com/ugd/ffde22_34e52cdf8e394a52a39a2220485e4c9c.pdf) were for pet supplies, vet care, or transport (they take small breed dogs, mostly chihuahuas, off euth lists in TX, Mexico, and LA—where there are waaaaay more chis than there are people who want them—and take them to NYC where there are waaaaay fewer small-breed dogs up for adoption than there are people looking to add a small-breed dog to their fam).

And if you don’t have cash to throw at Waggytail, think about throwing some positive vibes or prayers his way tomorrow. Like he & his current vet are both champs and don’t *need* vibes and prayers, but it can only help, right?"

I just moved into a room for rent, and I have no other forms of income if I lose this job.

Thank you for reading.


Edit: Cost of an Uber to and from Work would be $27.85, but honestly a $25 card would suffice and I'll walk the rest of the way home.

If anyone has any experience with ligament tears, it would be much appreciated if you could tell me if this is normal or not.

574,misc,"I decided recently that I want to propose to my boyfriend of 4 years. I remembered that this year is a leap year and is one of those times where a woman is “allowed” to propose- I’m also a very liberal woman and think why the hell shouldn’t I be the one to ask?!?!  I was the one who asked him out first, I said I love you first, I asked him to move in— so, it only makes sense that I propose to him. We love each other dearly. Also, I read that Finnish people believe if a woman asks on feb 29, it is good luck. 

Anyway, I recently saw an article of the UK poundland store selling “standby” rings. I love this because I really have no clue what ring to get, do I get him a ring? Can we just go through that process together? 

Also he says “standby” anytime he’s in the middle of something or about to go underground for the subway and won’t get reception, or focused on something and I’m trying to interrupt him lol 

So PLEASE! I’m asking for your help - could someone please mail me a poundland ring to Canada!! I will reimburse for your troubles. I think he is a size 9 ring.  

Much appreciated



Our back story:
We have known each other for over 20 years. We were always friends but he was in a serious relationship that turned in to marriage that turned into divorce. I was in several long term relationships, one was his friend back in high school. We finally were both single at the same time and I always knew he was the perfect guy.  I finally got a chance and I didn’t want to lose it- we saw each other basically every day since our first real date. We can chat for hours and enjoy lots of things together and apart. We support and encourage one another. We also keep each other in check. It’s great finding your equal but I still thinks he’s the smartest, sexiest, greatest catch of a man!!

I estimated that i really would need about 500 over the next two weeks to carry me to my next paycheck after rentals and upcoming bills are due, but i was conservative inorder to keep my requests to my family, friends, and reddit. 600 was to give myself a little wiggle room if needed.

584,bills,"I need help, I don't like asking for help because well I'm kinda a pain like that. But I've no options left besides asking Dad to help and that's not something I want to do. (He'd create drama about it because it's him) I've been out of work for about a month now, due to medical leave so I've not been able to make any money to pay my phone bill, and now I need a new brace due to why I was out of work on a leave of absence (same as medical leave) I was diagnosed Tuesday with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome so I need a brace that fits correctly so I can go back to work but that is my lesser concern. (I can use the brace I have until I can get paid to get a new one) but what I'm most concerned about is the phone bill. Because that is my biggest concern and where I need help the most.

Normally I would not care that my phones turned off because wifi works the primary parts of my phone but I need my phone this month due to needing to be able to take calls due to medical appointments. I have been approved for the medical surgery I need but I am waiting for the call to set up the final appointments to get said appointment and now that I have to see a physical hand therapist bi-weekly I need to be able to take their calls if she has to reschedule or I need to because of my other therapy or appointments. And again I cannot ask dad to help because that's already been an issue as of late and I was hoping to be back to work by now but trying to work with my caseworker for my leave of absence has been hard. She likes to communicate through phone calls, and I prefer email. But I still have to get to my primary doctor to fill out the papers to come back to work, and theirs a chance I will be laid off after I get back. (its a seasonal gig so not sure they will treat my absence due to medical etc) so I really need help.

I need help paying my phone bill first and foremost, I can make my brace work until I can pay for it myself. the phone bill is $40 dollars and I'm more than happy to send a screenshot showing this (Its metropcs, its the cheapest plan I can use because I can't always get to wifi so its easiest to use the unlimited data part) normally I'd have no issue with this but sadly as of late again I've had a problem. It's due today which is a problem as well and I cannot do much about it, I was truly hoping to be back to work much sooner than this so I could pay it myself. And I'd be more than happy to pay the money back as well or to pass it to someone else who needs help as well. I would use the borrow subreddit but I cannot give an estimate of when I'd be able to pay it back. But I'd be happy to or pay it forward as soon as I get a check again. 

I use paypal as my transfer stuff because its the simplest form I have. Please if you can help me that would be amazing and again I'd be happy to pay it back but I just do not know when exactly I'd be able to. I hope to be back to work next week or the week after at the latest And then I can pay it back and get my brace. so please if anyone is able to help with the $40 I'd be so grateful and it would mean so much to me as well.

Thank you so very much"

Good afternoon Reddit.

I've posted here before, and I feel horrible asking again especially so soon. But here's my story.So I'm waiting on Disability to be confirmed, until then I absolutely need to make every penny count. I have Epilepsy and am unable to drive. Luckily, there is a soup kitchen on the other side of town, I've got pretty used to the walk. Heres where the problem starts: We have some significant winter weather coming over the next few days - and even if I could trudge through it, the kitchen is likely to be closed...and I'm plum out of some basic staples, and cash.

I'm a great budget cook (learned from necessity), honestly even just $3 would make me enough lentil curry to last the weekend. I really would like not to starve during this cold weekend. I use PayPal as my bank, and can give you my email. Either way thanks for reading, I hope everyone has a wonderful day."
590,misc,"Just wanted to see if someone could possibly help with this since I have no family to ask for assistance. I discharged from an inpatient rehabilitation facility about 2 weeks ago for my depression and anxiety overcoming my life. Since then was able to obtain a job and also rent a room for the first time ever. Before my mental illnesses became severe I had a nice career and was close to finishing college on my own, but it seems like I've had to learn how to be independent all over again after losing everything due to my mental illnesses, I used to be assisting people not asking for assistance so it's been hard for me to get the courage to have to ask anyone for such a favor like this. Luckily a nice redditor had helped me with food until I get my first paycheck in a week and a half, but I've been having issues with transportation to and from work as almost every other day I dont have enough $ for the bus.  I've been looking online and have found a nice bicycle for $65 on Facebook marketplace. I didn't know if anyone could possibly help me financially with obtaining it. Or if it was possible for someone to buy me a 30 day bus pass online that would be great as well. I just need reliable transportation so I dont lose my job.  Currently live in Raleigh, NC. I can provide any information you'd like for proof or if you have any questions about me I'd be happy to share.

My pain never went away and it got so much worse. I was going to the bathroom upwards of 20 times a day. Didnt return to work. End of september i had a fully under anesthia colonscopy with biopsies. Nothing was found. I fought for a hida bc i knew it was my gallbladder. Sure enough it was. October 24th i had my gallbladder removed plus another allergic reaction to the preop! They found it was chronic cholecystitis plus benign tumors. Im a 24 female not overweight. Id been suffering for 9 to 10 years. I finally returned to work part time beginning of December for 2 weeks. Full time since then and im barely surviving. Had insomnia since surgery #1. My joints started to swell big time after this last surgery and ive lost 30 lbs.  My insulin resistance is bad bc i wasnt able to take my medicine due to not eating alot. My thyroid has developed 2 nodules that are being tested(i had hashimotos before anyways). It was going to be saturday but we are getting bad weather saturday so i have to postpone it again :(  My gyn had to take me off my birth control for a few months(i have bad pcos!) Because i wanted a new birth control as my old one probably added to my gallbladder issues. All this is new since surgery. i can no longer wear watches or jewerly because i develop rashes. I had to cut 9 inches off my hair because it hurts to wash it. I have (seemongly) permanent severe pain where my gallbladder was removed from in the front and the back. I have to sleep on an electric blanket just so i can move on the mornings and sometimes i stuff pillows behind my back and semi under me for supporrt. The nights i dont sleep with heat my mom literally has to apply heat to me for hours to help un stiffen my joints. My left wrist is basically gone with pain. I sleep with 2 wrist braces on, 1 on each hand. I have to wear an abdomen binder (i have 3 options depending on the level of pain that day), i have gloves and compression for my hands and fingers, i have compression for my elbows, braces for my knees, and compression for my ankles. I sob in pain and today i i couldn't make it to work because of my pain. I can't do things like consistantly chop vegetables anymore because im not strong enough to push down sometimes or the pain gets too bad. Im using pickup for things like a 24 pk case of water so i dont have to load it in cart and unload it etc. I feel like my life ended overnight in many ways. I hope this makes sense. Im so exhausted most nights i can choose to shower or eat a small meal but never both. The pain is just indescribable and im terrified. Im only 24. We are trying to figure out what is causing this all. 

Could be a severe nutrient deficiency but also we are inclined to believe that im severely allergic to the metal clips in my body that they used for both appendix (also used and left metal staples in me) and then my gallbladder. So thats a whole mess that im trying to figure out without much help from drs, except for  dr who isnt covered by insurance

Im asking for the items on my lists because ontop of not working for 3.5 months, i am now having to meet my deductible again for insurance and ill do that before end of February at this rate. We have had multiple home emergencies that consumed multiple months paychecks right before and right after my first surgery. Last month mg car needed maintenance i had already pushed off for 6 months, a new battery (not related to maintence that was pushed off), and all 4 of my tires were bare. That alone consumed 1500 to 1700 dollars. All my credit cards are maxed out and i cant afford the items on my list(esp list 1, bc i tske care of my kitties and mom first). 

The items on this list #1 are things that are meant for people with arthris/bad joint pain(my mom also has SEVERE arthritis), things to allow me to get food/nutrition with minimal work, allow me to clean without having to stay in bed the next day, compression for my hands and fingers, tools that are meant to be easier for people with joint pain to use so i can take care of my home.

The items on list #2  are for my furbabies. 

List 2:  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/VR2M05IPRAT6?ref_=wl_share

We adopted 2 kittens end of December because #1 my older cat has extreme separation anxiety from me and panicked when I was overnight in the hospital. #2 he has the energy of a wild cat and needs a play mate #3 he gets SO lonely its heart breaking. He watches us leave in the front window #4 i will always put my kitties needs before my own and they are so so spoiled.  Always. #5 before my surgeries i worked a 2nd job where i made an extea $200 to $400 a month. Since the new yeat my pain had increased tenfold snd where i had hope of returning to that job in December, these new developments are preventing that .

I have enough cat litter for a year or so because i managed to coupon so well i got each box for $4 vs the $15 it normally is so im covered litter wise. 

Mom and i didnt want to let my cancer scares(negative for breast cancer thankfully) hold us from doing things we had planned on it. especially since i will most likely have to have another surgery or two to remove the clips and then another 1 or two for exploratory reasons. :( 

Thank you for reading this. Im so sorry again if it doesnt make sense.  And im so sorry at how long it is. I hope i followed the rules. Thank you.

Edit: pics of cats for fun. All 3 are special needs. I can submit proof o dr bills. My paycheck statments showing how much it is vs my monthly bills etc if needed! Yall are bringing me yo tears with your generosity. I wasnt evem done adding stuff before you all started helping. My mom and i are shocked. We never have had support like this. Its always just been us. And i just.. thank you all. Thank you so so much. 


2nd edit: to further clarify the dr not covered by insurance agrees something is 100% wrong with me and is willing to run the needed tests. One of the tests i need will cost anywhere between $500 to $800 and its to test for metal allergies. Yes. Its alot. Yes. Its needed. No insurance wont cover it :(  my mom has severe arthritis, fibromyalgia, no cartilage left in hands or neck, and she is looking at a cataract surgery and potentional knee surgery and to see if the dr can do surgery on her hand. Her feet have hsd 3 foot surgeries on 1 foot and 4 on another and all failed so she id obviously hesitant. I am truly the ""healthier"" one of us and the only one capable of doing any ""heavy"" lifting etc. Of course im not going to tell my mom no if she drops something on floor. It hurts me a ton to get down there. But it would kill her to get down there."
593,bills,"Hello everyone, this is the first time I ever did something like this, and with my luck, I doubt it would work out well. But to explain my situation, I have graduated last year; my mother and I have been trying our best to uphold the house. Sadly, my mother wasn't able to pay the rent for a bit, and we have a court date due tomorrow. I kept searching for ways to get help, but after seeing so many stories about these things failing, I am scared. I wanted this to be a last resort, but everything we have tried to do just kept falling through.

If you can help, anything will be appreciated. We owe $1000 more to the landlord, and they have been trying to avoid our calls for any type of assistance or partial payment. We have looked around for churches or services that can help us, but many either don't respond to us or aren't able to help us. If you can't help us, sharing around would be very appreciated.

I’ll start off by saying that I’m a senior in college that works part time to pay bills. I recently had to take off for four days to be in the hospital with my mother. She had been recovering from a hemorrhagic stroke since last year and she accidentally fell trying to get out of bed and hit her head. Luckily she’s fine and didn’t cause any more swelling or bleeding in her brain. Unfortunately, my paycheck was not enough to pay my rent for this month. I’ve tried all possible routes that I could think of. My family members can’t help, I’ve posted in R/borrow with no luck, the area I live in doesn’t offer any type of rental assistance, I’ve talked to my landlord and she’s already extended the deadline to the January 12th.

It's supposed to rain for the next 2 days. I could really use some help getting the rest to stay at least one day. Two days would be awesome but I don't expect that.

I'm working part time, But with funeral cost, bills pilling up and fixing our car. (drive shaft fell through) I don't really have enough money to cover preasents. 

It's been pretty rough.

I found both and I was ecstatic. I love the place and I did like my job. On the downside, my boss made flirty gestures toward me and management was chaotic. However, it paid well so I thought it may be temporary while searching for a better place to grow my career. 

I got fired for being 2 hours late due to an emergency. At first, my boss was okay with it but his boss was in the office that day and immediately shut me down. I begged and pleaded but she had decided I was done. 

I haven’t saved up much money because I spent so much getting a new car (used, bought outright) after my last one gave out. I only have some pocket change for gas and groceries. 

I live in a hire at will state and I do not qualify for unemployment. I have rent coming up next month ($775) and a phone bill ($100)

Over the past month, I’ve accumulated over $300 worth of NSF fees due to automatic/recurring payments. I reached out to Bank of America in hopes of getting some of the fees waived, but the representative I spoke with basically told me there was nothing that could be done.

I’m currently a college student, and starting my spring semester next week. I don’t receive any financial assistance, and will have to pay for my own books/tuition out of my own pocket, on top of these fees and other financial priorities. 

I understand there’s some accountability to be taken on my part for letting the fees accumulate and not taking necessary action sooner. All I’m asking is for a little assistance in helping get back on my feet. Even a little bit helps tremendously. Thanks. PM me if you’d be interesting in helping somehow.

610,misc,"My husband and I just celebrated our ten year anniversary and his first anniversary serving in the United States Air Force. 

We just moved to our first location. Our town is very small and I am struggling finding work while being in school. I decided to take this term off and focus on finding work without any distractions. So far, I have applied at a dozen or so different places and haven't heard back yet. I do keep checking up and hopefully some good will happen soon! I have never been without a job for this long and I've been battling depression along with the financial stress that comes with unemployment. To add to this, our base is also very small and I am working with hiring staff as well. 

My husbands birthday (29th) is coming up in a few weeks and he has been so stressed since starting this new career.

Throughout the last few months he has been mentioning that he wants another keyboard someday...

When we first met over ten years ago, he would play music for me. He is so extremely talented and would often compose his own music on his keyboard. He would play for hours and fill the house with the most amazing harmonies. It brings tears to my eyes just remembering it. 

He had a nice grand yamaha keyboard that broke a year or so after we met. Over the years I tried to get it fixed for him at two different repair shops and they both confirmed that it was unfixable and he decided to donate it for parts.

I would love to get him a new keyboard for his birthday, much like the one he originally had. I know that's hard to ask, and I wouldn't be asking, but know how much a new keyboard would mean to him.

I would never normally consider using his military status to gain anything at all. But this to him would mean the entire world. Music for him is an outlet, it's his therapy, his happy place and know he needs this outlet right now. 

I've saved the monetary gifts that I received from my parents for Christmas, which isn't a lot. Our family's are not in a financial position to help.

This is a total shot in the dark for me and something way outside my comfort zone. I'm doing this for him, for his sanity and his happiness. If there is anyone willing to help me do this for him I would be so extremely thankful and beyond grateful. 

If you read this I want to thank you for taking the time to hear our story.

Edit: more financial information

Upon completing technical training (tech School) he was delayed three weeks because he received his orders late. 

He was supposed to be allowed RAP where he gets to stay in his home town while assisting the recruiters office. But, because his orders were late he missed this opportunity and didn't get to spend time with friends and family before moving.

Because of the delay of information, he had no choice but to use his entire leave (PTO) and had to cash in his retirement in order for us to afford to move to our new location.

While we do receive basic housing allowance, it's not that much. Our rent is on the higher side because it's the only housing we could find when we got here. We are absolutely planning on moving somewhere cheaper when our lease is up. 

So for those who don't understand why I'm asking, hopefully this information helps. It's not as great as people think. Pay wise, he was making more money working at a Mill back home. 

We have had a very rough year. Please be kind."

I moved from the south to the north and am facing the newest enemy to drivin: snow. I had an accident with thin ice on the road and ended up in a ditch.
Now my insurance is telling me it is a possible total loss. I don't know what to do.

How do I bring this up to my parents?
Can I convince the insurance to pay best they could and I pay the rest to fix the car or is it over the moment they declare ""total loss""?
How much do they usually pay for scrapping the car? Visually nothing is wrong but the front driver side bumper. Maybe something under it is wrong?

Local Arizona/USA lady here who could a helping hand. I'm not proud to be posting this but I have to admit I've run out of options.  My account is overdrawn by -$324. I managed to buy a box of ramen with change but I am going to run out before I got paid in 2 weeks. I have a handful of pennies atm. 

If I am being straight honest, I'm this situation because I had a mental break down and wasn't able to work. It's a long story but I come from a small family of addicts that are abusive. My sister had my niece last year and I agreed to be a part of the family again if she stayed clean. Right before Christmas she decided to abandon her baby to go on a 3 day heroine binge. After involving CPS I said goodbye to my entire family forever and then promptly broke down into my first anxiety induced psychosis. I wasn't able to take care of myself properly but I am now. I am on medication and am working with a wonderful therapist. I just returned to work part time. 

I don't know if it's possible but I would be eternally greatful for any food. I would absolutely be over the moon for anything healthy like fruit, vegetables, nuts, yogurt, eggs though! Ive lost a lot of weight from eating ramen for months. Anything that can help me regain streng sounds amazing. 

I don't get paid for about 2 weeks but when I do I can and WILL come back to pay it forward! I can absolutely take verification and thank you photos too.

617,misc,"Hey all, my family and I have all been struggling to help my brother get on his feet in life. I am reaching out to Reddit as a last resort as all other efforts have proven to be unsuccessful. I will try to include as much of the important details as possible while at the same time keeping this post concise and to-the-point.

My brother is 23 y/o, currently unemployed, and living in an apartment with me. Nothing seems to truly spark his interest besides video games. He's a very unique fella, and I suspect that he may be on the spectrum but have nothing to back that up. Here's a little bit of a back-story.

After high school graduation he went off to college but failed out after two semesters. He proceeded to move back home and work various minimum wage jobs for several years, such as food delivery driver, factory worker, and landscaping. He has never formally quit a job and has always been fired because of not showing up/being late most of the time. The period of time in-between jobs has never been less than two weeks. He has an inability to save. Most of his money is spent on gas station goods, computer equipment, weed (it is legal in our state of residence), and various other items. To sum this up, he has a chronic spending problem.

My brother does not seem to have any interests other than video games and watching YouTube videos. He doesn't have many friends, and doesn't talk to any girls. We have a gym at the apartment withing walking distance, but I can never get hit to come with me. He has no awareness of world & national event and has little to no desire to learn about much other than the latest video game news. In my honest opinion, he is living in the dark. My family and I have tried to brainstorm ideas with him but hasn't taken a liking to any of them.

Tensions began to grow between him and our stepdad as stepdad saw no sign of my brother moving out and growing out of this phase of life. At this point, I invited my brother to move in to my college apartment. I thought that he may need someone there for him on a day-to-day basis to help him get off his feet. Furthermore, it might help to be surrounded by people who are closer in age to him. I have always tried to motivate him in a positive manner, and seldom do my family members and I come down hard on him as we are all aware of the delicacy of this situation.

My brother has operated on a late sleep schedule for a long time now, but in the past few months it has only gotten worse. He was fired from his last job about three months ago and has been scraping by since. His sleep schedule has evolved into a stay up all-night and sleep all-day kind of deal. He showers only a couple of times a week and rarely does laundry (only when it is absolutely necessary). For the most part the only way to reach him is to physically speak with him. He avoids responsibilities by ignoring texts and calls from both family and friends alike.

His rent is paid for by our father, as he is the lease guarantor and my brother has no money to cover the costs. He now lives off of Christmas money (not much, believe me). It would be easy to say that my parents are enabling my brother's lifestyle, but I have gotten together with them and discussed the alternatives. I am a firm believer that he would simply resort to sleeping in his car if he was cut off. We all want to best for him and would like to see him find a passion, something that motivates him to wake up in the morning. There are a lot of issues here that need fixing but I believe that there are underlying issues here that explain all of this, I just don't know what they might be.

618,basicneeds,"To make a very long story short, I was supposed to come out with my boyfriend over Christmas to meet his family. Instead I ended up getting arrested and charged with a felony for having a quarter of weed and 4 grams of wax on me. It was for personal use, in child proof safety bags (multiple) and I have a red card for it. I would NEVER smoke and drive, i know the rules and wouldn't put my medical card on the line over something like smoking while I was driving. They arrested me and kept me isolation for two weeks and took me cold turkey off my prescribed medication cold turkey.  Anyway. My boyfriend had to use every penny including our rent money, gas and food and hotel money to get home. We were able to get to my sisters house in Hondo Texas to stay the last two nights but we have jobs and appointments and other obligations we have to get back to. I just need help with some cash or a gift card for gas and to get a hotel room so we can pull over at the half way mark to rest. And possibly be able to eat at some point as well.  But we would be grateful for literally any assistance we could get at this point. We just want to get home and get home in one piece. Thank you all."

I'm here, so that you may hear my story and just maybe if you connect with my story, and are in the position may offer assistance that will not go to waste and that will live through myself as I too pay it forward as I'm able. My wife and I have just went through 6 months of hell, we have went from homelessness to new jobs and renting a duplex. Two days ago our car broke down and we are both at risk of losing our jobs if we are unable to have the vehicle repaired. We are still living paycheck to paycheck, and we are now extremely scared to have to return to life on the streets. 

6 months ago my wife and I boarded a ride we would never forget. It was a very frightening and trying experience, and in the end it brought us closer. 
I lost my job of 12 years and not long afterwords my wife's employer of 10 years went out of business. Our home, newer vehicles, summer vacations, all faded faster than I can explain. 
We found ourselves struggling to pay for a hotel daily and before long the focus of finding a job and a source of income  quickly shifted to learning how to survive on the streets, and formulating a plan to get our life back.
We fought through dirt and sweat, rain and cold, we learned what it was to be hungry and tired, often times people would avoid eye contact, and we would learn what it meant to feel ""less than human,"" as if our lives simply held no value to this world or our community. We also learned humility and we learned how to be humble. Most importantly we discovered the true strength of our marriage and our love, we learned commitment and dedication, and we learned that we are stringer than we ever thought. 
Many hiked miles, we find a new city, enlist in new jobs, sleep under our roof in a place we are learning to call home, and we purchase a cheap vehicle. The pieces to our new life were falling into place. The prior months of hell finally paying off, and everything went smooth, until, it didn't........

Two days ago my wife dropped me off at work, and proceeded to drive to her new job when our 16 year old car decided to stutter as she tried to drive and ultimately stalled out. The holidays were rough as it was and it took every dollar to have the vehicle towed to a shop, and be told that we are going to have to have the valve body replaced. The best quote we have received is $260.00, my wife works with a woman who happens to have a son that owns his own mechanic shop, and he has offered to do this with no labor cost. 

We are in desparate need of $260 to repair our vehicle so that my wife and I both can keep our jobs. Neither of us have yet to be late at our new jobs. Now, we have far more than being late to fear. Losing our jobs can so easily slide us back into homelessness, and without this repair it seems inevitable."

629,pets,"Hi everyone,

UPDATE: The hamster has seen the vet, had what turned out to be a large abscess drained, and has been prescribed antibiotics and pain meds. They said he should be back to acting like a healthy hamster in 7-10 days!

Someone in my local area found a pet hamster left outside in the snow- presumably because of the large tumor/growth on its face (pics attached- its on their left side). The person that found the hamster couldn't care for it, so we took it on as my boyfriend and I have experience owning small pets and quickly made a bin cage for the little guy, until we get to the pet store today and get proper bedding, a wheel, etc. However, we need to get him/her looked at as soon as possible so we can treat the tumor on their face, and it'll be a financial hardship on us as we're both working college students and weren't expecting to pay for vet treatment of an additional animal. The campaign is currently just to cover the initial appointment but we will likely raise the amount/ start a new campaign once we know how much it will be to fix whatever is wrong. To clarify, no matter what this hamster is going to receive care on Jan 9th, and we will be paying the veterinarian with CareCredit. However donations will help us out greatly with paying off the CareCredit. Anyone who donates can request more pics of the hammy and even help us name him/her too. Thank you so much!

633,basicneeds,"Location (Iceland)


Okay so the story of how I got here is a little long, and I don't really expect this to work but I am very desperate..

So I'm a 21 year old father of 2 (2 year old and 9 month old), who Is dealing with severe deppression, anxiety and many other mental health issues as well as having very severe psoriasis covering every part of my body to the point where it is hard to move..  Because of these issues I couldn't keep a job, and my doctor recommended I'd try to go to ""work rehabilitation"" to try and get to a place where being a working man would be more reasonable.

I come from a family where you are not supposed to accept money from the government so I was very hesitant but my psychologist and my doctor convinced me that it's okay to admit when you need help and that it was obvious that I wasn't going to get better without some serious treatment.

I do that, and after about 6 months of work rehabilitation, they tell me that their professional opinion was that my problems were to severe for them to be able to help me right now, and since they didn't expect to be able to get me ready for the job market within the next 6 months, they said I had to apply for disability until I've completed more treatments and then they could take me back and help me get back into working.

So I did.. But there was a problem..

The person who wrote what is called ""the final report"" worded a certain part in a way that was misinterpreted by the government employee handling my application so they thought I hadn't completely finished trying out rehabilitation which is a requirement. This was confirmed as a misunderstanding and they fixed the wording and made it so it was 100% clear that was not the case.

But the damage was done.. they are notorious for never changing their verdict here and even with 100% no way to misinterpret them documents stating that it is fully tried, they deny me disability based on the fact that it wasn't fully tried.. after getting rejected 3 times even after explaining everything and even having them talk with each other (the people who ran the rehabilitation and the government office handling disability) it always ended the same.. So I thought I'd just go back to rehabilitation, I mean that's what they're telling me to do, right? Nope.. I applied again and they denied me do to me being to sick for them to be able to realistically help me..


So they ask me to apply again for disability..

We've issued a kind of ""law suit"" you're supposed to do if you want someone from a different agency to check if they are justified in their denial but I'm not sure if it's gonna work..


But this has taken 6 months.. 6months of no stable paychecks .. I have 2 kids and have no more ways to scrape money.. we owe thousands of dollars to the bank and have no way of getting more loans.. 

My girlfriend has just finished her maternity leave (which was about 900$ a month in a very expensive CoL area, which my whole country is) and has no job to go back to either.. So we have nothing to keep us afloat..


I do have amazing in laws that help a lot so we do have diapers/formula for at least a good chunk of the month, but would appreciate any help for everything else (weather it would be cash deposited to PayPal or food ordered from somewhere and sent to us, doesn't matter)

Anything at all would mean the world to us!

I am currently unemployed for the first time in my life and recovering from hip surgery. We have two tiny humans to worry about as well.

654,bills,"Hello everyone! This is my first time posting here and my first time asking for help like this so bear with me... 

My fiancé and I currently live in a two bedroom house with our one year old daughter. We have both been dealing with some medical issues. His cost him his job, and I lost mine after taking off too much time to take care of him and myself, not to mention our child who also got sick at some point in this time frame. 

It took awhile but we finally both have jobs again but our savings have been cleaned out because of bills. And we won’t be paid until well after our bills are due. At the moment my phone bill, the electric bill, and the rent are all past due as of tomorrow at 4pm EST. We have cut all expenses and have been using all of our money for bills— meaning we don’t have food either. 

All I am asking for is help with rent and electric so we don’t lose our home, and so we can keep the house warm for our child. I can give specific amounts and proof of the electric bill through PM. (Can’t do this with rent— we do not have any paperwork to prove we live here as we rent from a friend of my father)  I am also willing to try to prove illness if I can find the paperwork from the hospital for myself, if not both of us. 

I would not ask for help if I didn’t truly need it. Anything anyone can do would be so appreciated. Thank you.

Edit: 

If I can pay my electric bill before 4pm EST tomorrow, the total amount needed (with rent) is $807. I will have to call to see how much the late fee is tomorrow when the company opens, so the amount will be more if it is not paid by then. I am willing to send pictures of my electric bill through PM if needed. 

Also currently building a grocery list on amazon, I’ll post that when I’m finished (slow internet— bear with me)

Edit 2: my post is only NSFW because of my post history. Sorry, this is my main account :(

Edit 3: here is the wishlist— https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/dl/invite/b4sH0nU?ref_=wl_share

Pretty much all of that is for the baby, minus the rice.

Edit 4: If the internet is correct, it’s possible you can call the electric company and pay the bill over the phone if I share my account number. If you would prefer to help that way rather than sending money (understandable!) I am willing to PM my account number. If the bill is paid before 4pm on 1/9/20, the amount is $307

UPDATE: a friend has loaned me some money for the electric bill and now all that is needed is $200.

FINAL UPDATE: a family member and a friend helped pay the electric bill so that it wouldn’t be shut off, and I received help from a redditor with my groceries (thank you again kind stranger!). Thank you all for your help and your patience! 😊"

I've been working as a data entry specialist and a virtual assistant on Upwork for over a year to fulfill the monthly payments but things are somewhat slow right now and I only have one contract that barely suffices my expenses, thankfully.

661,basicneeds," Hey. My name is Shawn and I'm trying to raise money to purchase an accessible vehicle so that I can get to and from work. When I was 17 I was in a mountain bike accident in British Columbia. It left me a quadriplegic for life.  


Since then, I've been on a journey to better myself and become a productive member of society. I put myself through university and for the last 6 years I've volunteered at a home care facility running its day-to-day operations. However, volunteering does not allow me to support myself so over the last few years I've been applying for a massive number of jobs.  


I'm currently living on government assistance which I desperately want to get off of.  In order to do this I need to work and I need reliable transportation as the job requires traveling around the province of Alberta. Thus, the purpose of my fundraising request. The vehicles they convert are some variation of a mini-van but the cost of the van plus the conversion to allow access to my wheelchair is prohibitively expensive. It costs $39,085.58 CAD for the conversion and $47889.54 for the purchase of the van. This out of the price range of a person on government assistance.   


Your generous donation would be greatly appreciated as it would allow me to work. And working would allow me to break out of the poverty this disability has put me in. It would allow me to marry my girlfriend of 10 years. It would allow me to carry the responsibility of providing for my family. People often say that there is dignity in work and I firmly believe that. I just want to live a dignified life and a reliable vehicle would allow me to achieve that.   


If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

665,misc,"So I've been wanting to start therapy for a while.  The tl;dr about why I need it is that I was raised by a narcissistic mother and emotionally abused by two exes.  My main problem is that I don't drive, and my city's public transportation isn't that great like in major cities.  Furthermore, my mother makes me take Uber/Lyft to work on her days off, so that can be up to $80/week that I have to spend to get to work. 

I have never gotten a direct answer from anyone on whether or not online therapy is covered by insurance.  However, this is where I want to start, since I work five days a week usually, and that way I can talk to my therapist when I want to.  What I would like to do is go to therapy for a year, then see where I am financially and where I am living by then.

670,misc,"Hello everyone,

I am a twenty year old college (sophomore, nearly a junior) in an small town on the Ohio River in Ohio. I have recently changed my major from digital simulation and game engineering to early childhood education for special education due to the fact that I could not pass my first engineering classes. I also come from a low to no income family, which means all of the money I have for college is in scholarships and grants. These grants will not cover my degree switch. (Can provide proof if needed) 
So starting in Fall 2020, I will be taking out loans in order to go to college, which is a major change in the full ride tuition money I had. Basically the money that I may possibly receive will go towards buying new clothes for the educator/teacher path that I have set myself on. 

All of the clothes I currently own are graphic tees, leggings, and jeans... All of which are not suitable for teaching. I also have no shoes that are sensible for the teaching path as well.

I can accept anything that will help out.

Thank-you

Edited:  Clothing and Shoe Sizes
I wear a woman's 2xl top, 22petite dress pants, and 10.5w woman's shoes."
671,misc,"I'm 21 living on my own in a house owned by my girlfriend's dad's house. She's 19. We both have mental health issues we're working on and supporting each other through all of it.

Early December she was living with me at my parent's, and we got kicked out. She was on food stamps, and we worked hard for any sort of small jobs we could find for $20 here or $15 there. 

Unfortunately, as I type this I'm using the neighbor's WiFi. We are completely broke, with no active cell service. We're struggling to find work because employers aren't emailing us back. We're relying on her dad and an unemployed housemate with 2 young daughters.

I want to switch to a cheaper phone plan just so we can accept calls for work, and talk to family.

Now to the **emergency**: I have to drive an hour for a legal meeting and if I miss it I could end up in serious trouble. I am asking anyone from the kindness of their heart, to PLEASE feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer them to the best of my ability.

I am *begging* for just $20 to have the gas to make it where i need to go and back. Anything else is seriously appreciated, and will go towards switching to the cheapest phone plan I can find so her and I can take more steps to get our life together straightened out.

I'm working as hard as I can, to the best of my ability. We have both been diagnosed with major depression each within the last 6 months, and have been together only a couple.

I am on probation because of a manipulative ex-girlfriend from over a year ago, that led to me attempting suicide.

672,education,"
Over the past month, I’ve accumulated over $300 worth of NSF fees due to automatic/recurring payments. I reached out to Bank of America in hopes of getting some of the fees waived, but the representative I spoke with basically told me there was nothing that could be done.

I’m currently a college student, and starting my spring semester next week. I don’t receive any financial assistance, and will have to pay for my own books/tuition out of my own pocket, on top of these fees and other financial priorities. 

I understand there’s some accountability to be taken on my part for letting the fees accumulate and not taking necessary action sooner. All I’m asking is for a little assistance in helping get back on my feet. Even a little bit helps tremendously. Thanks.

673,basicneeds,"I posted a while ago about needing gas and vehicle maintenance to get out of town on. There was no response to that post so I’m reaching out for winter wear because whatever funds I can come up with will go to the travel expenses. I won’t have anything to work with to get proper clothing on top of travel expenses . I’ve been out of work for a long time as I’m disabled and was applying for social security. Due to circumstances I can’t wait for the determination. I got hired for a job that still hasn’t gone through yet. I have to make money to get home on because suddenly the place I live at is being sold. I thought I had more time being that the deadline was August... then June... now it’s March. But considering a recent turn of events I need to get out as soon as possible. My significant other is a recovering alcoholic (sober almost 2 years) that has relapsed and I need to get gone MUCH sooner than March. ASAP.  The change of plan with him not going with me adds to the level of broke I’m going on. The situation is volatile. I have a mental illness and this kind of thing has a really bad effect on me. So I will be leaving as soon as I get enough to cover the travel expenses whether I have clothes yet or not. 
I’ll be traveling with a small dog and two cats. I have hardly any clothes even for Florida and I have zero clothing for anything under 70 degrees. I prefer donation of clothing you already have but no longer wear. I’ve seen the amazon wishlist in other posts so I created one in case someone out there wants to look at it and see if they have any similar items. I also left the list open for editing in case someone out there knows of an item I would need that I don’t know about yet ( I’m not familiar with cold weather necessities) if you do have suggestions add it to the wishlist for me. I am 5 foot 2 , 190 lbs, female. My size is around an extra large.  Both male and female clothes are fine (I even have some male clothing on the wishlist.. cheaper and does the same thing..) I’m short, but if the pants or sleeves are too long I can hem them. shoe size is anywhere between 8 and a half and 9 and a half. The conditions of the clothing matters none to me. If it’s stained.. worn... doesn’t matter as long as I can put it on and get warmth, the appearance is the least of my worries. It’s 60 something degrees right now in Florida and My feet have been like ice for 3 days (no.. not every Floridian is like this.. I’m anemic so I’m always colder than the people around me) so anyone that got  new winter socks for Christmas and you need to get rid of the old ones I would LOVE to have them! And the 10lb pup could use some warm clothes too if someone out there has any their pet no longer uses. He’s really old so his bones won’t like the cold. 
Also.. if anyone knows any cold weather tips for animals.. vehicles relocating from warm area to cold area tips.. cheap travel road trip tips... any and all advice is welcome. I haven’t been in this kind of situation since I was in my early 20s and times have changed so let me know if you know!

675,medical,"My name is Devin and I am almost 20 years old. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis three years ago, as well as GERD two months ago)

I’ve never been in remission, it’s always been a long downhill battle. I’ve been hospitalized for a total of 90 days now. Countless small procedures and surgeries. 

It’s been very hard on me and my family. We’ve always had a very healthy family. It was super sudden and shocking for everyone when my brother and I were diagnosed in the same week, he is 21. Fortunately, he has been in remission for almost two years. 

Because of the constantly worsening flare up, I’ve been exposed to some very rare infections. My immune system is so shot from the biologics I’ve been on, steroids, and many other meds, as well as malnutrition and anemia.  The worst being Staph Aureus Bacteraemia, and a super rare bacteraemia, but I can’t remember the name.  The doctors say it’s a miracle I’m still alive after everything. It’s one of the worst colitis case they’ve ever seen. 

There is hope for the future. Finally I am on a biologic that seems to be starting to help. I’ve been able to lower medication doses. I had to be put on lots of pain medication from the severe pain I had daily. Finally that’s come a lot down. I’m also on all the nausea medication you can think of, the most expensive being Intramuscular Gravol I am on over 15 different medications daily, and 14 of them are covered. Unfortunately not the IM Gravol (dimenhydrinate). 

It’s very expensive, but it just so happens to be the medication that helps the most for my nausea. I’ve tried CBD oil, I’m on Nabilone, as well as 5 more including Ondansetron. Altogether, the Gravol is around $400 every month. I’ve had to spend just under $3,000 on it now. Without it, I can barely move many times during the day because of how bad the nausea is. I throw up constantly. The nausea, as well as some other bad symptoms, make it so I have to miss many days of work. That makes it so I’m losing a lot of money that way as well. 

It would be extremely helpful for the cost of the IM Gravol alone to be covered. I would be so so thankful. Unfortunately I just can’t afford i. I’m going in to quite a big debt. With the costs of school, other health care stuff, and everything else, that’s already enough. Without the Gravol, I wouldn’t be able to function normally in a day. I wouldn’t be anywhere close to myself, even though I already am far from the athletic cross country runner I used to be. It at least helps me through the day. 

Having that money reimbursed would help me be able to pay back my parents. They’ve been a big help for lending me that money for it. I love them so much, and it’s killing me to see the financial trouble they’re going through now, I really want to pay them back. It’s been a hard year for them. After losing a close sister, seeing what their two boys are going through, and much more, it hurts me so much that they are always willing to lend more to make it so I will feel better. I truly am thankful for it. But it’s hurting me to see them going through this hard time. We all are. 

I know it’s a lot to ask for. I’m not expecting anything at all. I am super thankful for what I have now. It would be the biggest help to have it reimbursed. A gift from God. I love all of you and thank you for taking the time to read this.

I did odd bar jobs a couple of times a month every time I could find an opportunity ever since, but have been unable to get a full time job. A couple of months ago I finally applied for unemployment benefit, and received about £250 for the month. 

I live alone, in a small studio apartment. It’s in the city centre. My rent is £575 per month, £65 bills, and the council tax was £120 per month (I’ve applied for a reduction due to my unemployment but am still waiting for this).

I’m young (22), and will admit that I’ve never really had to look after my finances to such an extreme before. I made the poor decision of taking out credit cards so that I could pay my rent and living costs. 

I am now in almost £8000 credit card debt, with an old payday loan debt and bills creeping up on me. My family are not in a position to help. I would be forever grateful for any help or advice that anyone can offer. At the moment I’m trying to sell my clothes and possessions online just to buy myself some lunch."

THANK YOU to everyone who sent diapers, we appreciate the help so much, you’re all incredible!!

My sister and her husband just suddenly got custody of her sister in law’s 3 kids (all  3 years old and under) and has a 2 year old of her own. CPS removed the kids from the mother and my sister was the only person willing to take all of them to keep the kids together. Otherwise they would have gone to separate strangers. 

They are 9 months, 2 years and 3 years old. The 2 year old is SEVERELY autistic and needs round the clock care or else she injures herself. 

While they need an abundance of help, the one thing she says she really needs is size 4 diapers because the autistic toddler goes through several diapers a day. 

My family has been helping as much as we can but ANY additional help would be immensely appreciated, just PM me please and thank you everyone in advance!!

692,basicneeds,"I'm in the middle I have a really messed up situation. I am temporarily homeless because of a combination of things that are really a typical. Waiting on insurance reimbursement, and the fraud department of my bank to recognize and reimburse me a significant amount. This should have been over a month-and-a-half ago but as of right now my pup and I are still living in our car. My storage unit is going up for auction. If this happens, all of my papers regarding the bank, promissory note, title to my car 3 insulin pens insurance papers and my best friend's ashes are all gone. The late charge is actually more than what the rent is. I am also not eating properly. I had to apply for food stamps three times and they were finally going to be here in 7 to 10 days. I haven't been here long enough to qualify for food pantry. I have been to the food pantry in my town and they only help you once a month. They gave me five cans of vegetables a can of sloppy Joe mix + 6 cheese sticks. I'm not picky cuz I didn't even have a can opener at the time. I have quite a few small kitchen appliances that I had bought to go in my tiny house. These are things that are in the storage shed that I can sell. I don't know how much longer I have to wait for this money to come in but if I have to fight the bank, approximately $26,000, I have no proof if I lose my storage shed. If I have to refile the insurance for any reason, I'm screwed and having to sue my sister, I will be screwed. No hope of me getting back on my feet. If I lose my best friend's ashes, I will have a awful hard time living with myself. I would like to ask for some help eating. I'm putting gas in my car to help keep us warm. I had to ask for help a few weeks ago and somebody that was kicked off of this site made some very ugly comments about me that broke my heart. He became drunk and misunderstood a comment that I made. I saw some posts he made but he had already been banned prior to me seeing his posts. He wrote me some very beautiful messages as well. I had nothing to do with him being banned.
 I have tried churches and 211 and I'm going to continue to try but I'm getting nowhere. I have a GoFundMe that might help explain a few things and why I can't work. The money that I'm asking for help with on the storage shed can be paid directly to them. I am very capable of proving everything I'm saying. Please forgive the long post. I'm very grateful that this site exists and for the people that helped me the last time to be able to take a shower and wash clothes eat and put gas in my car. They made me feel human again. I hate that I'm having to ask for help. I just don't really have much of a choice. I have had hard times in my life but never this bad financially. My pup has never known a time that I couldn't buy her treats or take her to the vet. Her personality has changed significantly in the last 2 months. I'm sorry for any formatting issues. I was attacked at a Truck Stop bathroom recently by a woman that was absolutely insane. Thankfully I wasn't hurt but it did break my phone.

695,basicneeds,"Hi everyone. So my cancer adventure has come to an end and I have been cleared for work. 

I can offer proof of nearly any kind. 

Reddit has been amazing to me especially the people over on food pantry- they’ve been exceedingly kind. 

I am able to go back to work immediately. The obstacle to returning to work is having enough gas to get through until what would be my first payday. 

I contacted the American cancer society about gas cards. Nothing available in this area. 

I’ve called food banks and Salvation Army. They don’t offer them. 

I live in a little town called Latham, Ks. We do not have Uber or Lyft or any of that, that’s how remote we are. 

My family is on an extremely fixed income and poor to be honest. Prior to cancer I helped them. 

So what do I need to get back out there to work and go back to the real world? Gas. 

It is 63 miles one way to Wichita. That’s 126 miles round trip per day. I will be returning to work at six days per week.

My first real full paycheck will be 2/1/20.

I’m looking for help with the gas which I’m estimating at 120.00-130.00.

Edit: down to 100.00 needed. 

I’m going to work tomorrow - I have enough to get there and back and right now every penny counts so I don’t want to miss any chance to earn money. 

I asked my supervisor about an advance. Essentially since I’ve been gone during treatment I wouldn’t qualify. I would need four paychecks under my belt.

So, here I am.

I can accept: Paypal and Venmo, Apple Pay edit: and cash app. 

I have nothing to hide and can accept reasonable requests for proof. 

PS. I will not be declared no evidence of cancer until two years of clean scans but it’s looking good. 

Thanks for looking as always Reddit and thanks for the downvoting. Classy."

699,misc,"Hi all,

So I think I'd posted here before asking for advice but most people just said to let the car go and just ""save up for a cheaper car."" That's absolute worst case scenario.

To break it down, I'm in my early twenties living with an abusive mother because the old place I had after my first college dropout ended up becoming a near literal traphouse. Roommates doing coke frequently, not a good environment as I'd finally come to an upswing of mental health that had me on only one medication to manage my anxiety, no pot smoking, and I was about to quit cigarettes (have been smoking for nearly a decade now). The issue I've ran into is that with both my mental health and physical condition (full-body arthritis) it's extremely difficult for me to manage a full time, on my feet position just in order to make enough money to pay my bills. I'd been working a decent paying butcher job when I got my car, and made payments early with no issue.

Today marks the second due date of my car payment I'm late on, and my biggest struggle is the APR of 15.91% on my auto loan. I've found other banks as low as 5.72% but with my poor credit (maxed credit cards I'd been making small payments on since I've never held a job over $12/h to give me more to send that way with enough for food, medical supplies, other household items after bills. The car I've been using to drive for Lyft with how that form of work allows me to not be in physical pain all the time. However with the current stress of not pulling in enough to make the car payments on top of what other bills I'm behind on.. The car is about 12k and my 1k since May has primarily gone towards interest alone. 

That being said, I'm the only driver in my household. Only one licensed. We live outside a college town but to the point where getting to any job would require bike-riding or walking, both of which I struggle with as frequent travel this way would send me to the doctor in a matter of days, which has been the main stickler in my job consistency as none of my employers really gave me the flexibility in my schedule that I'd always been assured of during onboarding.

I'm in the process of appealing my third Social Security application through a pro-bono law firm that's spoken highly of in my area, but my case manager informed me the process usually takes up to a year. Without my car I can't make money through Lyft, can't go grocery shopping, and can't go to my bi-weekly counseling/psychiatry appointments which are detrimental to my wellbeing.

Food stamps I can't receive, although I had been approved living in my own during the process, the sudden shift home led to denial with my mother being on disability and making too much to qualify for herself, essentially sweeping me under her decision because I live with her.

I don't have any family closeby (nearest is over an hour drive and it's my 70 year old grandfather), and I literally do not have anyone who could help with rides due to conflicting schedules and just lack of disposable aid, which I'm not upset about in the slightest. I respect my friend's lives and it's hard enough burdening the few I have discussed when as much as they'd like to, they can't help. My mother doesn't assist in any of my bills spare the roof over my head and my phone. My brother picked up the electric bill but barely has much left from that. My plan all in all is to move out and get my own place for privacy (I don't have my own room) and a place to get rest after work.

As far as employment, I'm trying to figure out how to find work more suitable for my conditions so I can actually hold a job longer than 4-6 months, and one that doesn't have me living from paycheck to paycheck. In terms of education I have an associate's for graphic design that I haven't used because of a lack of a recent portfolio, and after dropping out of college twice due to stress at home and my mental health affecting work quality in the jobs I've had for their short time, I feel completely at a loss. I'm scared I'm going to lose my car if I don't make money fast, but I don't know my options and am desperately in need of guidance to help me figure this out.


All advice is welcomed, but please, for the sake of me not having a panic attack I'd like to try and avoid the notion of just letting my car get repo'd as I've put too much into it already and still can't stand the thought of fucking up something I had such high hopes for considering this is the first auto financing I've ever done.

Thank you for reading.

update(1): Managed to make around $50 to throw at the bank, praying that'll take some heat off of the repo fear. I've got therapy later today and I'm in the verge of tears knowing I have to tell her what I'm dealing with and that I won't have rides to even stay in therapy anymore.

update(2): Got in about five hours of sleep, woke up to my mother getting hundreds of dollars worth of new shit after telling my brother the car is most likely gone soon he just said ""who cares."" I have therapy in an hour but I'm reaching my mental fucking limit.

update(3): Therapy earlier helped calm me down drastically, and with the people who commented thanks so much for the advice because I'm not gonna let this day end in a negative mindset. I appreciate it!"

I recently moved about 3 hours from my hometown to start my first job out of college. On the way I had some car trouble and other unexpected things come up and the only food I currently have in my apartment is a few things of pasta and a box of macaroni.

I’m going to be starting plasma donation to help pay for smaller expenses until I get paid on the 24th, but can’t begin until next Wednesday. 

I am simply requesting a few dollars to go to the grocery store and get some items of substance. Anything small will help. Thank you!"
718,basicneeds,"I know I said food was my main concern, but our water just got shut off. The bill is $219 to get it back on. 

EDIT: accidentally hit post before I was done writing. So I'll be adding to this.
EDIT: I finished the post, sorry about that.

For anyone who didn't see my post last week; I'm disabled and live with my boyfriend and his 3 kids from a previous marriage that he has 50/50 custody of. He left his job to accept a job offer for a better paying job. But the hiring process has taken around a month now. He starts his new job any day now, he had his physical today and passed so it's just a waiting game to start working. Once he is working everything will be fine. 

But now our water was shut off and even with emergency assistance the soonest we could get it back on is the end of the week, and that's only if he can get a hold of all the documents they need by then. We didn't know it was THIS close to being shut off. 

Any help would be so greatly appreciated. And as I said on my last post, we will be forwarding all help we receive once he starts working. If anyone needs proof of our bill or anything I can get that for you. 

Thank you for reading. Thank you for the previous help with food.


ETA: The reason this is urgent is cuz we have no clean dishes as we weren't expecting this, so we can't clean any dishes to cook anything. There are animals here that don't have access to water. His ex wife is known to throw custody in his face and not having running water for the kids is already a bad thing if you don't have someone up your butt about custody. We were already only drinking tap water as we have nothing else to drink here. We've been doing our best to tough through this, but losing water makes it impossible."
719,medical,"I had to go back to the doctor because I wasn’t feeling any better and they told me to go back if there wasn’t any improvement in a few days. He had sent me home even though I tested negative for strep and now they’re telling me it’s tonsillitis so I have a new prescription but just like the last time I can’t afford it. If you’ve seen my post history we’ve been having a pretty rough time with money lately, I hate to keep asking but I really have nowhere else to go.

They gave me a prescription for something called Metriondazole (I probably spelled that wrong) to treat tonsillitis. 
As always, thank you!

Edit: Here’s an image of [proof](https://imgur.com/xeDGQNL)  that I picked up my last prescription"

721,misc," Hi everyone!

For my dissertation I am currently investigating how social media usage impacts body image concerns among pregnant women and would very much appreciate it if anyone would be willing to complete my online study to help me out.

The study involves answering a number of questions relating to your social media usage and your body image both pre-pregnancy and currently.

Must be 18+ and currently pregnant to participate and the study should take around 30 minutes. Thank you!

722,medical,"Hello Assistance! I am requesting help with the last bit of my down payment so that I can finally get my teeth and gums worked on.

I have been saving up for this and I'm currently about $162 short of what I need to schedule the surgery. I already have a payment plan in place with the dentist's office for the rest of the balance estimated by my insurance.

In return I can crochet you something! I can do hats, scarves, baby blankets. It'll take me about a week to do and ship if you're willing to wait for it :D (it'll cost less to ship those than the payment) I have all of the yarn and hooks already. I'm also dabbling in making characters so I could make you a wonky looking Dobby. So please let me know if you would like to help. I have PayPal and CashApp

Edit to add: I'll start projects tomorrow and will gladly send picture updates of the item I make you :D"
723,basicneeds,"My girlfriend is on her way home and has had a bad day. We have both had really crappy winters so far, actually. I came out to my parents and they aren’t speaking to me, I was hospitalized for half of December, and my car was stolen the day before Thanksgiving. My girlfriend ‘s job has been pretty rough lately and on New Year’s Day she fell and broke two teeth and fractured her kneecap. Things have been...not great! 

I would like to surprise her with some pizza or Chinese food as a treat, but I am completely broke until Thursday. She had to borrow $20 for gas from a coworker today, so I know she is similarly broke. Would anyone be willing to help this sad sack (me) and their gorgeous girlfriend with a hot meal tonight?"

725,basicneeds,"Would anyone be able to donate a few dollars so me and my mom can eat today? We're homeless and unable to make money due to her not being able to uber/doordash without a car and my own job hasn't started yet. 

We should be able to get calfresh pretty soon, but we would really appreciate if someone could help us get food today.

I have PayPal and cash app if anyone can help.

Thank You

Edit: I think the way I worded a sentence my have given the wrong impression. We are not homeless because my mother couldn't uber/doordash, we became homeless due to outside circumstances unrelated to her job."
726,basicneeds,"Hello to anyone reading. I hope your day is going well. I recently lost my car this week to a break line and while fixing it is an entire different problem, I have a bigger one. I’m living out of my car currently so I’m homeless. I was able to pay for a weekend at this extended stay, but I do not have any money to extend my stay any longer. Checkout was this morning and I walked to my gym where I’ve been at all day. There are a good amount of hotels and extended stays around me  and any assistance will be appreciated, please and thank you."
727,bills,"Heya I don't know if I'll get help from here but I don't know where else to go. I'm trying to scrape up money for rent and no one can really help me from them having Christmas and all. And also I don't have many friends that can help me. My mom is struggling to pay rent and take care of my sisters so she can't help me. I can't donate plasma cause I'm a diabetic with bad sugars cause I never see a doctor cause I just can't afford it. So that's out of the question.And I got fired from my job at 7-11 a couple weeks ago and that sucked cause I don't have a car and the job was only a 5 minute walk away. I have 135 after selling stuff but I don't have anything else to sell really. I live with my friend but shes strict with rent. It's only 175$ cause I pay half of hers. And there electricity coming up. Im sure I can get electricity but I need help with 40$? If anyone can help me? I'm so fucked on rent right now I can't even buy food for myself. It's a small rent to pay but I'm struggling so much that 40$ is a lot. Please and thank you. I've been on Reddit for the past 2-3 years and this is the first time I'm reaching out to this sub cause I'm genuinely in need of help right now. 

Tldr: please help with rent I need 40$ to cover my rent and it's kicking my ass."
728,misc,"Hey guys! I’m having a really rough few months! I always wear contacts, even though my insurance only pays for glasses. But i recently got out of a scary relationship and got my own apartment and lost my car and most of my stuff. Then i almost immediately fell and broke two bones..and my glasses. Glasses do not stay well on my face so i don’t like to wear them.
My prescription is outdated, but i order my contacts online, and the place i get them from, i can get them for $111.80, shipped. 
Please help, if you can. I can’t get new glasses for a year and a half. I just had wrist surgery and need to start physical therapy soon, but my vision is so bad, i rarely leave the house because i have to wear one ripped contact!"
729,pets,"Hey there, 

My sister and her boyfriend care for a herd of Galloway cattle, have rescued one male calf from a dairy farm in August and are in the process of rescuing another dairy calf that was born blind. The herd used to be raised for meat, but when my sister and her boyfriend took over, they decided to end the killing and to let the animals live in peace. Dairy calves are more expensive to raise than Galloways because they can't be outside day and night all year, they need grain on top of grass and hay and they are much more prone to disease.

We have set up a Gofundme page with more information and pictures here https://www.gofundme.com/f/rescued-blind-calf-and-her-friend-need-help
PayPal is also available. 

We are thankful for all donations, let me know if you need more details."
730,bills,"Hello everyone. My name is Nick and I've recently come into some really hard times. 2019 was an awful year for me. I lost my girlfriend of several years, I recently lost my job due to things out of my control, and my living situation is now in jeopardy and I may be homeless if I cannot figure out a solution. My rent is now past due, and I am really scared and desperate for help.

So here is some backstory on me... if you don't care to read that's ok, it's mostly me venting I guess. You can skip to the next paragraph if not.

I don't like getting handouts. I grew up in Maine where hard work and manners was the standard. My father was a carpenter with his own business for over 20 years and I definitely picked up his creative gene. When I was 18 my mother left my after being married for 21 years. It wasn't until my father committed suicide on Thanksgiving day when I woke up and realized how unhappy they both were. I was living at home with him in the same house when it happened and They gave me and my sister such an amazing life but looking back, I think we always sort of knew they were unhappy. I just never thought this hardworking, stubborn, genuine man would leave the way he did. Needless to say I have been such a wreak ever since. I tried moving away as far as I could to forget my pain. California is where I now live, but let me tell you, being on my own has been so hard. I'm severely depressed and have been for a long time. I had a relationship with someone who slowly developed a bipolar disorder and ultimately completely ruined my self esteem. Now, it's made relationships so hard for me as I was abused physically and mentally, cheated on, lied to, stolen from... the list goes on. My credit was ruined because of this girl I dated a long time ago so even finding a good apartment or taking out loans is almost impossible. I then dated another who was an absolute angel. Supportive, kind, genuine... she was the one. She grew up with a Mexican/Persian background and I am very white. Her parents both despised me just because I was white and I never could have a real relationship. In every situation, holiday, event, celebration, they always made their daughter choose them over me. I spend/spent every holiday alone and the relationship had been a secret for the last year, which is how bad it had gotten. In the end, it wasn't healthy and she left me. Everything sucks. I have no idea why I have it this hard but I really hope it gets better...

So a few years ago I came across an artist online (I can't remember the name) who was making these really small bonsai trees out of wire and really thought they were special. I wanted to see if I could make them and sure enough, I could! I couldn't stop making them. I ended up making about 7 in the first week. They are extremely time consuming but I love it. Some were really large, but most were small as I was still practicing the technique. I wasn't sure what to do with them at the time so I gave them all away to friends and family as gifts for Christmas.

Anyways I currently live alone and am 3000 miles away from all my friends and family. I have no support group where I am and have no way to take out loans without a job.

Then I had an idea...

I thought instead of begging for money, maybe I can give back to those who help donate to me!

I thought maybe if people who donate $50+ will get their own wire tree of their choosing! If you donate a larger amount (maybe $100+?) I will send you a much bigger wire tree if you want it! 

My rent is $1400 so any help at all is greatly appreciated.

Below I am attaching some pictures of the ones I've made in the past so you can see how big they are. I am attaching below as many pictures as I can so you can see!

Thank you for your time.

731,misc,"My pup went through a very rough pregnancy. She was very small for a pregnant dog (shes a pitty) so the vet thought she was experiencing a fake pregnancy. Turns out she only had 1 pup in the womb. Yesterday they called for an emergency C section at 62 days (luckily my mom was more than willing to help with the costs so I could get my baby into surgery, which I will truly never ever forget.. She saved her life) and the puppy didn't make it. Im completely heart broken. The baby was beautiful. Just this perfect little thing. As I was holding her while my dog was being sewn up and in her recovery kennel, we got to spend time with the little one. I just kept expecting her to start moving. To wiggle around and grunt and whine. She had been gone for a few days and her little lip was already peeling. We've had some legal issues with the studs owners so to lose the only baby we had just crushed me and my fiance. Bless his heart, when I asked about the cost of our little angel's ashes and it was out of my price range, he jumped in immediately saying he wanted to buy them and didn't care about how much it cost. I will never forget that. They say our girl doesn't know she was pregnant and she just feels like she had a great nap, but i know she knows. I know she's crushed by this, and I know she feels the pain of us losing the little one right along with her. I haven't felt a pain like this in a long time. Its deep within my chest and I feel hollow. I want to be strong for her, I need to be... But just thinking of how perfect that 1 baby was.... Im just devastated. I should've taken her to get an ultrasound. I should've taken her in when I felt something was off on December 27th. I should've listened to my gut. Everyone told me she was fine. That everything was normal. And I really can't forgive myself for letting my girl and her baby down.

Edit: we will be focusing on her and not getting another dog, thank you for the insight

P.S. I don't intend to get any donations from this post, it really is just to gain support and reassurance, however I'd be more than happy to accept any donations to go towards paying my mom back for the vet bill faster than I am capable. Im missing some work so I can help my baby recover from surgery so help is definitely appreciated ❤ However like i said, it isnt what this post is for :)"

733,loan,"Hey all, I made a post not too long ago asking for help on this sub and tried out a recommendation one of the users on here gave but sadly there weren't any of the said resources around me that I could get to.
So here is my situation. I'm $180 short on rent, I've managed to scrounge some money together but I only have 2 days left to make rent.
I just started a new job and my first day hopefully will be tomorrow. Just waiting on the background check and such to pass. 
Anywho I would really appreciate any assistance at all. No matter the amount. If anyone does help me out here I can certainly promise I will pay it forward on this sub since my new job would allow me to in someway.
Thanks."
