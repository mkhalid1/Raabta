It's been a goal of mine to get my long time friends and partners better PCs.  
We live in different countries and gaming together was the way we initially connected (with each other and our extended friend group) and is still one of our main sources of group entertainment.   
Their current PCs are old Dells from the 90s running intel graphics however and struggle with anything but the simplest of games (default minecraft with the graphics down runs, dark souls runs at about 10fps, etc)   
Life always manages to get in the way of being able to upgrade however and whilst they don't like asking for money, I will absolutely ask for them!   


I've put together builds for budgets PCs that would run about $300 for each PC with room to upgrade.

I finally got them to create a money pool so I could help by donating a bit at a time (set to $1200 but that is just a generous ceiling for GPU and all, $600 is closer to accurate) and would be eternally grateful to anyone who wishes to help, with however much they wish to spare!

bills,Panicking last minute I dunno what to do,"Today (Saturday, Jan. 11th) at noon is the absolutely last day I have to turn in our rent for this week. (Weekly payments needed this place sucks its a long story) in the past we’ve come close but family managed to help us but this time we’ve been told they aren’t going to help us and I’ve frantically tried everything at this point. Selling all my possessions anything of value, doing lewd things for extra bits of cash but I’ve only managed to scrape up like 30$ on top of the leftover cash from our last pay period last Friday. And that’s only like 50$ (last I checked however bf might have used some for gas today) and we owe 279$ for the week. I have a few odds and ends to sell so I’m willing to not just take free money but please help me out. I don’t want to even think about what happens if this place kicks us out. I have kids. I’m freaking out. My bf works full time (and a second place) I watch our children and sell on eBay but my business has really tanked as of late it’s really not doing well. In fact fees are hurting me and I may just close the account. 

I’ve applied to jobs even fast food at this point but daycare is an issue as my family wants nothing to do with my bf or his sons we would have been just fine as expected until we got our electric bill and it really fucked us bad I don’t know what else to do I’ve written here before in times of panic before friends had helped me out but they’re hands are tied too so I really am stuck

Literally anything would help even a dollar I swear to god. I can show bills, I’ll surely get a notice today for rent (landlady is quick to post them) I’ll show that, and if you are interested in the items I can afford to sell pls dm me if not, I offer other things and if you can’t afford to help I 100% understand that just please I ask you to share this or spread the word I can even draw anime like stuff I’m not very good but anything for compensation Nothing is too far fetched at this point I really am desperate mY HAIR IS TURNING WHITE IM ONLY 25 WTF"

medical,"I'm in some real dental trouble, and it's not cosmetic.","WARNING: KIND OF GROSS PICTURE.

&#x200B;

Okay, so. I have some pretty weird teeth because I had a lot of high fevers as a kid, and in the last few years I've had a couple of teeth just . . . hollow themselves out. No apparent cavities or anything (although I have plenty of those elsewhere, my teeth are crap in spite of regular brushing and my funds are low), they just go hollow.

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago I noticed this weird swelling on my gum. But it didn't hurt, and this being December and me working in the service sector, I sort of went ""I should get that looked at"" and forgot all about it.

&#x200B;

I woke up this morning and that swelling is very, very angry about being forgotten. It's doubled in size, it's centered right over one of those hollow teeth, it's *throbbing* and the gum around the tooth is bright red. I've had to do this before: it's an infection and the course of action will be ""dental visit, 'we can't save this tooth,' antibiotics, another visit, pull it.""

&#x200B;

Even through the cheap dentist in my town that's going to be around $450: three hundred to pull the tooth (*I'm not joking it's fucking ridiculous*), $60 each for dental visits, and about twenty bucks for the antibiotics.

&#x200B;

In the past, I've always been able to pull money from *somewhere* when one of my teeth decides to go rogue. But because it's year-end/year-start, my final 2019 paycheck was out-of-cycle and constituted one week's pay that has to last three weeks instead of my usual ""two weeks' work for two weeks' pay"". Once I paid phone and rent, that was all gone, and I don't get paid again til the 21st.

&#x200B;

If some guardian angel wants to throw the whole $450 at me I certainly wouldn't say no, but right now my main concern is eighty dollars: enough to get in, get meds, and get this infection down. I'm running through PayPal because GoFundMe says it takes up to a week to get funds and I literally cannot wait a week (if the infection got that much bigger that fast, its next stop will be my sinuses), so I can be found at [technicolor\_nina@yahoo.com](mailto:technicolor_nina@yahoo.com), BUT . . .

&#x200B;

If you want proof, here's a (gross, sorry) picture. You can see the hollow tooth third back, with the broken bottom. That weird gray/black quality isn't cavity--it's literally a lack of tooth innards. I had to get the camera too close to my mouth to do the traditional ""paper with my reddit name on it"" thing, but you can pop the image into Google search, nothing else will come up.

Basic needs,Winter Appeal Samos Volunteers,"We urgently need your support! 

Winter has arrived in Greece, temperatures have dropped drastically and it has been raining for days on end. There are currently more than 7500 people living in the hotspot on Samos, the southern-most Aegean island, in a camp which is build to only host 648 people. This means the numbers of people have DOUBLED within the last 10 months and the camp is more than 11 times over capacity.  Most of these 7500 people are sleeping in tents and makeshift shelters which provide no protection against the cold or wet. For us, this means  even more people are coming to seek some warmth in our community centre, shelter from the rain, a hot cup of tea, an hour away from the  conditions in the camp, away from the rain and cold. 

We are running the biggest community centre on the island, and our doors are open six days a week for everyone who wants to come. We teach  an unbelievable 120 classes weekly - 19 daily language classes, alongside art, fitness or music practice - and we offer activities for children and women. We also run the only laundry station on the island, offering some basic hygiene for people living in muddy and wet tents. With the increased number of people and the terrible living conditions the needs are getting bigger and bigger - but our resources are scarce. 

Samos Volunteers relies 100% on donations. This winter, we urgently need your support to be able to maintain our activities during the next months to keep our lights on, our tea warm and our classes running.

Edit: i already posted the same thing to another subreddit but it didn't get as much attention"

'Hey friends! I am blocking the person I am making this post about from seeing it. I have a friend who is just the sweetest person. Shes had a rough life. She lost her fiance and two children. Shes really trying to be strong but shes suffering. She had to face the hardest thing any mother could and pull the life support on her baby. We met just before this happened and I am too far to hug her... Too far to hold her. She was the first person to support my business among the midst of this time. She blows my mind. Now shes out of remission with cancer and shes back in chemo. Shes losing her hair. Shes dealing with pain and illness. Today she had a tough day where someone made her feel really bad about her appearance and the way she smells while going through chemo. Its ripping her apart. She has no real solid support system and no supportive partner. She is in a state of extreme anxiety panic and depression. I noticed in her posts shes putting herself down for not having things she needs not even having the right things to cover her hair loss not in a way where shes seeking pity or help but shes genuinely putting herself down because her self worth has plummeted My heart aches. I remember going through sickness and losing my jobs not having any support the day of my tumor removal, medicines making me sweat through my clothes, peeing myself having no clue about how to buy the right wig or wear it, the mood swings, and the lack of the will to live... I want so bad to be there for her. I remember two strangers named. A.S. and L.W. being the only twobpeople there for me. Thats how i met them total strangers who had hearts of gold and chose to be there for support. I was thinking that I would like to ask for a gift for christmas. Ill post my paypal link in the comments of this post and If you would like to donate towards this and include a message for her with your donation I would like to buy her a wig and the nessicary supplies to make this more comfortable for her and to show her she is loved and valued and that her life is precious and she deserves nice things and she deserves to smile. Ill find an artistic way to include the messages so whenever she feels consumed by loneliness she can turn to them. Thank you for reading and considering helping out! Every single penny will help ! And yes you can share this story with your friends and family and the link to my paypal and my email but the post will only be viewable by my friends because I had to block her from seeing it in the settings'"

Well to keep things short [VoiceMod](https://www.voicemod.net/) is an application that serves as a PC virtual soundboard (alternative for expensive physical soundboards) that I would like to use on Dota 2 games to entertain my team and well to have fun. There is actually a free version but very limited in features and unfortunately the feature that I need is covered within the pro version which costs 20 USD. I currently have 10 USD from my first (and currently last) commission 5 months ago as a freelance starving artist. I really do not want to spend it on this but I also would like to have something for myself this Christmas. I know it sounds absurd for me to want such expensive product despite not having resources but I really would like to have it if there is any less spendy way for me to have it. 

Please do not force yourself or feel guilty if you cannot help. I do believe it is not a primary need for me anyways just something to add some fun in my life so I'd appreciate even the slightest thoughts or wishes. Those are more than enough.

As gratitude to the sponsor, I will illustrate any character/image of your liking in my style for FREE (though I don't think my art is worth much). You can browse my account to have a general idea of my abilities and whether it is a good trade. Of course you can hire me instead if you somehow appreciate my works that will do just fine. Thank you.

You can send me a message if you have any inquiries. I don't expect much donations really but I would gladly discuss further transactions in personal messages to avoid sharing credentials. Thank you very much and happy holidays!"

I don't know how to contact them since they don't have social media I tried to call them but never connect. I bought 2 hen and 1 cock for him last week.  so he can do something and maybe he could sell it after the chicken has chicks.
I desperately want to help him out more but since my parent's medical condition requires me to spend almost all my monthly salary (my salary is around USD 750 per month) for them.

So today it was brought to the attention of a local community, an elderly gentleman put a bag for life on his garden gate with a note asking for food and electricity as he had nothing. 2 local citizens arranged to meet at the property to see how they could help, on arriving they were greeted by a elderly gentleman called William, he explained that over the past year things have just got too much and couldn't cope! No electricity and No Gas heating for OVER A YEAR...........the house is freezing, infact warmer outside. Locals put £100 of his own money on the gas and electricity meter to find out that the meter hasn't been working for over a year, he spoke to the gas company and they are coming out to sort it with the next 4 hours (that was 5 hours ago). I have spoken to Local Foodbank and they are going to provide help and direction to help him but in the mean time ..................... WE NEED YOUR HELP ASAP. ITS A SHORT TERM FIX but will help somewhat in waking William and feeding him

I love computers and was doing what gave us a life and a place to live and rest and have great family times, My kids were stolen from me with my exes help when I went into a mental hospital over 18 years ago for delusions and thoughts, I'm still severely depressed over my kids being taken from me but after many years of trying anything to kill the pain well it is always there no matter what it comes back sometimes harder than others but it's always there, I don't want to keep doing this it's really killing me I have to try and I have to give it one last good shot ok so I figure this is my plan any input is greatly appreciated and will be cherished: since my babies I used to tuck in at night and wake up in the morning are gone hopefully not forever that will really kill me, sand since I have mental issues and I'm severely depressed I must do something about it I can't just try to grab another mind altering drink, I believe God is letting me know it's now the time, so I want to have somewhat of a Christmas for at least my son that I haven't been in contact for over 17 long painful years, he just started talking with me but just for him to tell me he wants to do things by himself he said since it's been that way for so long, (and now is not responding to me) now obviously he doesn't know I've been searching for him and the girls for so long and took a toll on my health because of this. I need start up money to repair and refurbish and resell computers, I think somewhere around $200 to $250 start up cost, I'm very good at computers that when I was doing them I had three nice motorcycles one was a Kawasaki klr650, the other a Honda Shadow 750, and a Harley nightster 1200, and a nice impala always rebuilt and in the driveway along with a nice little apartment along with work space and space for my tools and a work bench to show for it Once people get to know me they always told everybody else that I know what I'm doing and my rates are unbeatable and the lowest anywhere and that I guaranteed everything I sold and just word of mouth put my good name out there like the plague I would have at least three computer sales a day, I older people to learn from and they like me so I like to keep my prices pretty low for everyone unless someone wanted to tip for the work or the equipment they're buying which I always said there's no need to but some you can't argue with, anyhow I would like to get some start up funds going even if some people would pitch in one dollar that dollar added to other dollars would make a world of difference for me to get what I need to repair and rebuild the computers and get the funds to try to go and see my son and pay off my license to legally drive again, I will need tools and software and money to purchase broken ones for rebuilding. I'm not going to sit on my butt any longer I'm done with the drinking although I've done it for about eighteen long sad depressing years days to where I don't even want to be here or even wake up I would always ask God to take me because the pain is just too much. I'm not going to sit and do nothing anymore I'm sick of it I  know I'm homeless but I can start now here today (there is a spot I know of that I can work around at if I ask them I'm sure) and I have to keep trying now with what I have left in my mind body and soul to get to know my kids that were wrongly taken from me and put up for adoption without my knowledge or consent while in the Looney bin WITHOUT MY CONSENT! Yes I'm homeless and don't have much at all except alot of bills, I'm sad, and suicidal, but this is insane if I keep doing and thinking the same things and I know it is. So I want to start trying right now, I want to change my situation because if not it's going to kill me, I want to feel much better than I feel and felt in the past and stop some of these meds or at least lesser doses because of side effects, I want my babies back most of all and I want them back now they are mine not hers she didn't care enough to keep and help them positively grow! I've missed them so deeply for so damn long I wouldn't know what to do if someday my hurt and pain lightened or disappeared, all I know is I can't do this anymore like I'm going because nothing good is happening the pain just comes back 100 times worse and this is my last stop im giving this situation in my life all  my energy everything I have so if anyone can help with anything at all it will be so appreciated it would be giving me the tools to help myself be successful, productive, and constructive so that I can provide so I can better  my and my kids lives, if anyone can donate at least just $1.00 it would be a blessing. $1.00 with others goes a very long way it all counts, I will keep everyone posted on what anyone donates if they wish with their name, if not requested then I will just put donated this much if anyone at all donates to my cause. This will more than likely be my very last stop here as well as in life only time will tell...

basic needs,Donate: wheelchair for a mom carrying her disabled son on her back for his entire life,"Hi dear redditors. Today I saw this video in one of the regional Serbian media about an 80+ year old mother and her 50+ year old disabled son. They live alone in a village and she's been taking care of him for 50 years, carrying him on her back all the time. She did this for his entire life: carrying him to and from school that is far from their house, etc.   
This is the video: [https://youtu.be/bSkJBz\_MCe8?t=80](https://youtu.be/bSkJBz_MCe8?t=80)

My situation is a bit complex, I'm a college student living in a low-income apartment (government subsidized housing), in a town where I have no chance of getting a job and there is no car to speak of. Nobody in the house works, and have been basically living off the kindness of others for some time now. Recently, things have changed and I'm very anxious about the future. There's a city not far away, and I want to move there with my family so I can look for a job and begin supporting myself and my family, though I am the youngest in the household. The thing is, I don't have money, any its going to be one and a half more months if not a bit over that before I get a bit less than $400 back from my college loans that I'm using to pay for school, and that's not enough to move on at all. Its not nearly enough. I'm not sure what to do. Is there a direction you can point me to?"

He is a ginger hooded, ruby-eyed rex and is approximately 1 year and 3 months old. At this moment in time, he is suffering with a severe upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and I fear it may have turned into pneumonia.

Rats are extremely prone to breathing problems and infections, - rex rats even more so.   
Without some antibiotics, Muradin will die. His breathing is laboured and he has lost weight. He's tired, barely eats and constantly comes to me for comfort. I even think he might be scared. I don't blame him. I'm scared too.

Usually, I'd be able to take him to the vet, but with Christmas coming up, all of my bills and trying to prepare for the festivities have meant that I don't have enough money to get him to the vet. I feel like an awful pet-parent, and I don't want to see him suffer or lose him entirely. He is a smart, sweet and wonderful little guy. He deserves a long life.

And I'm still not comfortable with saying everything, so let me just tell you as much as I can right now. You have no idea how many times I have thought about moving out. How many times I was crying alone in my bed. How many times I was just laying there not thinking, not moving. Not knowing what to do with myself. My ex still doesn't understand. He still thinks that the problem is with me and me only. Well, now it is. He wasn't aggressive. He never yelled. He was always speaking in a calm, soft voice. But it was even worse. First, when we moved in, he was a total disaster, he almost never did anything. I thought that I get it - he was in a sh.ty relationship before he needs time. He used to do dishes once a week and after that he was saying that he did so much while I did nothing. But you should hear him saying that. He sounded like a real knight in shining armor who was worried about me. He was so convincing. So manipulative. And I felt bad, so every fucking time I was getting to work. But I was always the one who didn't do a thing. I was always the one to blame for everything. After few months I thought that I don't really care and I stopped. I was exhausted. And guess what. Two more months after that, he started doing everything. But by then I already felt like I don't want to live there and I was wondering if I ever wanted to live at all. Every time when I was considering moving out he was changing again. We were acting like real partners again. But it never lasted for a long time. I dropped out of university 3 months after I started my masters. Few months ago my friend realised that I'm not myself. She asked me what happened to the old me. The one who took care of her health and diet. Who cared about the environment. Who read a lot of books and watched millions of movies. Who wanted to adopt a dog in few month. Who enjoyed life.I started crying. And I couldn't stop. And I didn't know. I probably still don't but I want to fight and be even better person that I used to be. I am moving out. I will live with my friend and her dogs. I have never felt so free and so empowered. I just have to wait two more weeks. But there is a problem. I will need money. My family is not supporting me at all and I can't count on them. I also don't want to ask my friend because she already helped me sooo much. I'm changing my job in a next month but December and January are going to be hard as hell. I have debts, because of this year and my stupidity. I decided to sell my laptop, so with this I will be able to pay a deposit for an apartment. But this month I earned almost nothing from my current job. And I thought that maybe I can do something here. I need to get 150$ or even better 250$ to be able to pay for everything. I was thinking that I can write personalized poems or poems with dedication. I can write personalized Christmas wishes. I can design entire Christmas cards that you can send you friends online. Whatever you want, with any theme you want (I used to be into many things, but if I don't know something I will do my research and I will do my best) Please, I feel horrible with asking for help from strangers but this is huge opportunity for me. I just need to survive 2 months with almost no money. You can send me anything here: https://www.paypal.me/weirdandsassy And let me know what you want to get, because I feel horrible with asking for money for nothing. Not being able to be totally independent is something I have always feared most. Thank you! https://www.paypal.me/weirdandsassy"
loans,Sorry to Ask,"This is my first time ever having to ask something like this and it's so uncomfortable and awkward, I'm just desperate.

I'm a college student who is just completely broke. I lost access to my online banking and won't be able to get in and fix the problem until I'm home for Christmas in two weeks. Something went weird when my bank was bought out by a bigger bank, and I need to reset my login. It's been a couple months since that happened, and so I've been trying to be as careful as I could about spending money because I couldn't actually see how much I had left. Yesterday I started getting notifications from Paypal that charges that shouldn't have bounced, bounced. I went through my Paypal account history and Amazon orders and the receipts from any time I've been out somewhere and paid with my debit card, and the numbers just don't add up. I'm not sure what's going on, but there are payments that should have gone through that haven't, for two Christmas presents. One of those orders I was able to cancel, but the other I can't because it was a custom order on Etsy that has already started processing. I talked to the shop owner and it just isn't possible.

Obviously my situation isn't as dire as some of the people here. I don't need much, I just need to get a positive number in my account before I start getting overdraft fees, only about $75. $100 dollars would be great, but I don't need that much. I'll take anything. I have a job, but since it's work-study on campus, none of the money actually goes into my account, it goes directly to my tuition. I just need enough to cover the things I've already paid for that won't go through on Paypal, and I need it in the next few days. Once I get home, I have a job waiting for me. I'll pay whatever I get forward, I just need help right now.

basic needs,Christmas Donations for kids.,"Hello!
My husband and I will be donating various items for kids to the Boys and Girls Club in our area. The Boys and Girls Club is a non-profit organization that offers lots of services including after school programs, lunch programs, shelter for homeless youth (they typically go into foster care), education programs, and so much more. This particular club seldom receives donations due to the area its in. 

Currently, this club has 50+ kids using their facilities. Many of the families are low income, and can't afford basic necessities like winter jackets and boots, or gifts for Christmas. The ages of the kids range from toddlers to teenagers and everything in between.

bills,Had to pay tuition bill earlier and now I have no rent money,"Had to pay my tuition bill earlier than I thought, now I don’t have rent

I posted a bit ago about having a tuition bill due at the end of this month. Something came up and I had to pay tonight. I had been not paying electric either, and got a shut off notice so I had to pay that bill too. Both of these add up to $1,033. Unfortunately, my rent is due tomorrow and now that money i saved for that is gone. 

My rent is $447. I have asked my property management company for an extension but I’m not sure how that will pan out. Literally anything helps me. I can show you documentation of these bills as proof. Thanks 🌈"

misc,I really really need gas asap to get home,"In between work from healing

Hi! I’ve been getting back into the swing of life after getting out of a long term abusive relationship and making a lot of great progress with my mental health journey. However, it’s been so rough for me trying to keep working and keep a stable state of mind while my therapy progresses. I’m getting better! But right now, cash is so incredibly tight and I’m so close to being into a steady cashflow and a good job but atm I can’t even afford gas to get me to said job. My parents are supportive of course and I feel guilty for my situation but at least I’m keeping my head up!
I could really use some help, anything really. Especially just some coin for gas. Survey apps and stuff is only working so quickly hahaha!

basic needs,it’s time to ask for help...,"buckle in, folks, this one is a little bit of a long read. :/

my name is alex and i’m a 26 year old girl residing in the southwest united states. first, i’ll provide some context- i had successful surgery on my right kidney (the good kidney between the two) in late august and thought it would get me by long enough to get back on my feet after 5 weeks of unpaid medical leave from my job. fast forward to now, just a few months later, and i am undergoing treatment for my left kidney already. between the pain, constant appointments, and the heavy likelihood I will have to undergo another surgery or two, i have been forced back on to unpaid medical leave, again... for an indefinite amount of time until i can be well and functional again. I have never felt so defeated, useless, and down right broken... 

Because of this, i am swallowing my pride and finally asking for help. my partner works full time and is usually able to take care of our rent payments and all of our most important bills (utilities, internet, car insurance), and we have cancelled all unneeded subscriptions like netflix, hulu, spotify, etc. Unfortunately, we are still already beginning to struggle with gas for our car so my partner can get to work, food and household supplies, supplies for our kitties, and my medical expenses. 

below you will see i have created a wishlist for things like food, household supplies, and kitty supplies if you feel so generous as to send anything my way. 
any cash donations would be deeply appreciated and will go to gas for my partners car, my prescriptions, groceries (if needed), and upcoming procedures/appointments. this would be unbelievably helpful. i am comfortable sending any proof I have, should you request it. i’m not shy and, at this point, i will do damn near anything if it means i can keep myself and my partner afloat. 

i can also offer small tokens of appreciation/gratitude (like handmade jewelry and crocheted items, resumè creation and career/interview consulting, a sticker pack from my sticker collection, etc) for your donations. I am limited as to what i can offer as tokens (since i only have so many skills) so DM me if you have something in mind. 

please DM me for my paypal link.

medical,struggling mentally ill + lgbt artist,"i was really trying to avoiding making this post, but i really need the help. things are only getting worse for me. my boyfriend suggested coming to Reddit and posting a bit about my situation. thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this or donate im so so so greatful and i wish there was a way to give back to you. everything means so much to me.
im a 18 y/o artist who has struggled with mental illness my entire life. my anxiety is so bad that i am unable to leave the house most days and it is keeping me from getting a job. i worked for a former Olympian (for free in exchange for knowledge) but im terrified of putting that on my resume because I left so soon due to their rudeness and abuse towards their animals. my time there made me even more afraid of working and i regularly have nightmares about my time spent there. i have made an effort to try and ignore my fears because I do not want to use my mental illness as an excuse, but it's getting so bad theres nothing i can do about it. i was receiving weekly therapy for anxiety, suicidal thoughts, trauma, ect. for about a year but quit because I was afraid to open up to my therapist. 
since i am unable to work, commissions are my only way of making any money. now that im 18 my parents no longer want to spend money on me, so I am forced to buy my own items such as clothes, things for my dog, and food because i am lactose intolerant and also have issues with textures. i am very picky. recently my old hand me down computer broke and is unable to run. i tried everything I could and asked my tech savvy boyfriend what to do and he confirmed that its 100% dead unless i take it to a shop. because my computer is broken i am unable to do commission work in exchange for money. this has greatly affected me. i am not even able to pay my monthly $3 fee from my bank. my boyfriend has been an absolute angel and does what he can to help me out, but i don't want to burden him anymore because he is also struggling. it's at the point where i have been considering becoming a sex worker to make money. my suicidal thoughts are worse then ever and the only thing keeping me from calling myself an ambulance is the money it costs and how scared i am to speak on the phone. 
im sorry for typing so much I really appreciate you taking the time to read this. if youd like to you can donate here: paypal.me/7brdges

medical,Seattle Children's Hospital,"Honestly, I don't even know if this works here, but I'll take a stab. 

Earlier this year, I travelled with a friend of mine as he walked across the state of Washington to raise money for the uncompensated care fund at Seattle Children's Hospital. We raised over $175,000 to help pay bills for kids whose families struggle with payment. In short, you shouldn't have to go broke because your kid got sick. You've got enough on your plate. 

We have since made wall calendars to sell with pictures that we took during the trip. 100% of all money made goes directly to the hospital, thanks to sponsors paying for production. We recoup nothing.

The father of the children does not pay child support and hardly ever comes around.  She just told us a couple weeks ago she was getting kicked out of her trailer. She has a job but they cut her hours and her daycare expenses were getting out of hand She has no real family- her mother abandoned her and is a drug addict so my wife and I are going to take them in temporarily until she can find something- we are by no means rich, actually struggling a bit ourselves, but we have a roof and food on the table and we feel blessed. We couldn’t stand to think of them not having a home to be in, much less during the holidays. We are really proud of her she is trying so hard to be a good mother and provider.

misc,"My friend & her mom have worked really hard to not become homeless, and they just need a little bit more help to get through this month.","Hi! I posted in r/assistance a while and everyone who responded to me via DM were scammers so I'm hoping that doesnt happen again. 

My friend Lena is a full time student who usually does doordash. I say usually because even though this girl has been through a lot in life (and really, who hasnt?) The last few months have been AWFUL. The car her and her mom were using to do doordash broke down, and the car they loaned from a friend was hit by someone while they were doing doordash. They managed to scrape up enough money to get a replacement car so they can work whenever Lena isnt in class, but alas - this car is now also breaking down. 

In addition, right after the car accident they were facing homelessness because her moms ex boyfriend kicked them out so he could have a friend of his move in. They managed to scrape up enough money from doordash using the car that is now breaking down to get an apartment, and a month in they are now left with no car, no way to pay rent, and no way to keep their utilities on. 

The mom is a former CNA who was laid off by her former employer because with her physical health issues she couldnt lift the client.

misc,Facing homelessness at the end of the month.,"Tldr at the bottom
Hello guys, this is actually my first post of Reddit believe it or not... I suppose a little back story is needed. About a year ago I moved out to Colorado with my husband to where his family lives. We decided to split an apartment with his sister which was mistake number 1. His sister is the youngest and a bit self involved. She's been telling his family that we've been paying rent late and just being assholes to her. We texted her and told hers she's not without fault and now she's looking to cutting the lease. 
We've been having auto problems with almost every car we have. And today when we were looking to sell the old car for scrap we found the window busted and the battery stolen. That's our fault. The other car we got to replace that one, the guy didn't tell us the radiator was bad and the heat isn't working. We live in Colorado where it's been in the 15s for the last couple of days. So now we had to borrow more to get another car. I would at a small retail store and my husband works front desk at a hotel. We're on the verge of being homeless and having to get rid of all our stuff that won't fit into our car. Everytime we think we're getting better more shit just keeps happening and honestly I'm at the end of my rope. I don't really know how any of this works but if anybody can help us get back to my family in North Carolina, anything helps. Thank you for reading 💙

TL;DR: my husband's sister in law in breaking the lease, our cars are undrivable and had to get a new one for work, and we have no money to get back to NC."

Fortunately, I wasn't having a heart attack (although I'm still experiencing the pain, and no one can figure out what's wrong). Unfortunately, that means that I have to foot an emergency room bill that I have absolutely no way of paying; I am currently unemployed due to other physical and mental health issues that have sapped most of what makes life worth living away from me, but I do not qualify for disability aid in my state despite trying time and time again. Luckily, my father extended his insurance to me so I don't owe anything astronomical, but I do still owe $435 that I have no idea how to pay off at this point in time. I currently live with my partner but I put no money on the table, and we're barely making ends meet as it is. I'm, as many people would be in this situation, fairly stressed and feeling lost. Any help, whether donations, or a nudge in the proper direction, is appreciated immensely.

Medical,"My father needs an expensive heart test, and I need antidepressants","Hello,

I'm a college student who is on leave of absence from university because I couldn't cope with mental illnesses anymore. I came back to my parent's place, hoping I could find some time to myself to figure things out, but my life only became more depressing here...

We recently learned that my father's heart is abnormally large and only has 40% of it functioning. He also has water in his heart and lungs. On top of the expensive medicine he needs, the doctor also told us that he needs to have an [echocardiogram](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856) within two weeks. My mom explained to me that, depending on the results of the test, we would have to pay 200,000 to 1 MILLION PHP... and we don't have that much money at all...

Now, my father's condition has become the top priority in the family, while my medical needs had to take the back seat... I'm not feeling resentful about this though, because my father's condition is more critical, so I understand.

However, as the eldest child around here (since my older brother is away for university), I am suddenly thrusted with the heavy responsibility of looking after my father... which is very difficult, considering I can hardly even take care of myself...

I suffer from depression, anxiety, attention deficit disorder, and insomnia. My meds and sleeping pills have ran out, and I'm now relapsing into a dismal state, oscillating between sanity and suicidal thoughts. I feel like I'm such a terrible daughter for being so useless even when the family is going through a crisis...

**Please help me.** I don't know what to do anymore. I need to get better, not just for me, but for my family... I can't keep going on like this... I have to get my act together, but it's really difficult. I don't want to lose my father, but I'm hardly even holding on to myself... Please help. Any small amount would do.

I provided first aid and within the hour we were in a doctors office discussing a 10% survival and the possibility of considering organ donations. My mother had two ruptured brain aneurysm and was unlikely to survive.

&#x200B;

I am an only child and between my dad we balance a job each at opposite hours and the rest of the time we are home in shifts taking care of mum.

&#x200B;

She is somewhat able to move around and do basic tasks but suffers from aphasia, a speech disorder, confusing words, and has trouble moving around much on her own. We live on the 2nd floor and there is no elevator. Basically since coming home in 2016 my mum has left the house on two occasions since we do not own a family car, and it requires both of us to be at home to carry her down two flights of stairs and into a vehicle for a short trip nearby.

It has crumbled us financially having to keep bills paid, speech therapist & physiotherapy. Unfortunately we can no longer afford Physio or the speech therapy for that matter.

 [**paypal.me/janehelp**](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/my/profile) 

What i hope to achieve is to raise an amount high enough to move out of our current rented home & find either a smaller more economical house on either the ground floor or at least with an elevator so its more accessible for mum to be able to get out more often with us. Also we would really like to focus on physiotherapy to provide her with the help she needs be stronger on her feet and more stable.

Basic Needs,Help a family of six afford Christmas,"[The question was asked ""How relatable is the movie *I, Daniel Blake*""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/dy72gp/people_who_have_watched_i_daniel_blake_how/f7z89qx/)

This was my reply:

I got about halfway through. It's incredibly relatable and realistic as far as my own experiences go.

We're a household of four/five/six on ESA and pip. Basically we're one missed payment away from being in Katie's position. As a rule we don't have enough to live on anyway. Our outgoings are as low as we can make them but food bills seen like they're going up every week.

We're not at food Bank level yet, but one DWP fuckup and we'll go under in hours.

I've had to siphon money out of the rent to make ends meet before now. Our social landlord rep was blessedly really understanding about it and we only have to repay a nominal amount a week.

We can only afford Christmas because I borrowed £700 from another redditor. Repaying that loan will leave us almost penniless between Christmas Eve and New year, but that prospect is more palatable than seeing four kids, two of them not ours but ""rescued"" from unbearable and abusive family situations, go without a Christmas.

The scene where she gets caught shoplifting tampons broke me. I had to stop because I was sobbing too hard to see the screen. Tearing up just thinking about it.

That could be us, really really easily. Holding on is knife edge hard. Added to my and my so's mental and physical restrictions, it's a daily...hourly on bad days...battle to keep utter despair from overwhelming me.

Someone has to keep going though.

So yeah, I'm not going to be watching it again. I can't.

pets,Margie the MIRACLE,"gofundme.com/margie-cakes Margie Cakes was found on 11/16/19 hovering against a concrete barrier on a narrow I-40 passage on the west side of the gorge near Tennessee. She was in shock from the speeding traffic so close to her and had obviously suffered trauma and in her hind legs and lacerations. She was wearing a tracking collar and it was soon discovered that she was a hunting dog running bears. The hunter tried to stuff her back into the small dog box on the back of his truck. At that point, the young ladies who had rescued her begged to take her instead. The hunters promised they would take her to a vet. The girls called the hunters phone over the next few hours to follow up concerned  that she would be put down since she was of no use to them any longer and could serve no purpose.  The hunter agreed to let them have her and confirmed their worst suspicions as to his plan for Margie. Margie was provided emergency vet treatment. She was very dehydrated and thin. She has a T11 injury and her hind legs are not working.  She suffered trauma and lacerations and shock.  Although Margie is injured and unable to walk on her own, she is finally free and happy!  She smiles and her eyes are so deep you can see inside her soul. She is grateful and loves to put her face next to yours. She is a beautiful brindle Plott Hound and a little over two years old. It appears that she will not be able to utilize her back legs again and will need a K9 cart and also to finish paying the remainder of her expenses.  She needs lots of prayers sent her way. Margie is a special dog and deserves so much better than the life she had previously living in a box with cedar chips and hardly fed, starved before hunting her prey. Even now, she looks at you as if to say “Thank you for saving me.”  Any money raised will be put toward a K9 cart to allow her to walk again and toward the remainder of her expenses going forward. Thank you in advance for any small amount to help this precious dog!"
,Fundraiser by Chris Aaron : Service Dog for a Combat Veteran,"Hello and thank you for coming here. 

I have been hesitant for the past 4 years about getting a service dog because my situation in life hasn't been easy and not ideal for owning a dog. Thank God things have gone a lot smoother the past few months and I'm ready for a service dog.  


It's been my dream to own an Old English Sheepdog. I remember the first time I saw one walking home from school passing by the vet's office one afternoon in 3rd grade. I'm currently 36 years old and I think it's time for my dream to come true. If you don't know what an Old English Sheepdog looks like, think back to The Little Mermaid movie, Prince Eric's adorable and fluffy dog Max is the dog type. It's the type of dog I've always wanted and I think we are all allowed to own our dream dog and it's my dream to own one.  


A little bit about me and times I spend with rescued animals. When I was stationed in North Carolina I volunteered my weekends at the local animal shelter. I know and witnessed from my time at the animal shelter in Onslow County, Jacksonville, NC how animals suffer and I know how important it is to adopt from a shelter. At the time I wasn't able to have a dog but I figured that there was a way I can help rescued animals find forever homes. Most of the sheltered dogs and cats I helped find homes forever for other Veterans and the elderly. I have seen how dogs and cats become part of the family not just for the Veterans but for the children and spouse of Veterans. These rescued pets have also helped a family deal with separation when a service member is deployed. Growing up we always had rescued pets and I feel like I can make a one-time exception. Again I want to point out that everyone is allowed to own their dream dog and I would love that my dream dog can also be my service dog.  


A little bit about me. My name is Chris Aaron I served 8 years in the Navy as a Hospital Corpsman. I did two tours in Afghanistan one in 2011 and the second one in 2013 in Helmand Providence and very proud of my time there in Afghanistan, it was the most rewarding time in the Navy I ever experienced and proud to have served with other fellow service members in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, my time there had caused me to develop PTSD along with other mental health diagnoses. In 2015 while stationed in San Diego, CA I sought mental health because I knew something was wrong with me. After months of being a mental health patient in the military, I was diagnosed with: PTSD, Depression, General, Social Anxiety, ADHD, Bipolar, Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychotic Episode Disorder, and OCD. A year later I separated from the Navy and continue my mental health appointments. This year in February 2019 I was hospitalized, I lost my memory and it took me 1 1/2 month to regain my memory. I have been in and out of jobs since I separated from the Navy because my mental health hasn't been that stable. I was recently diagnosed with Disassociative Identity Disorder (formally known as Multiple Personality Disorder) and I'm currently being evaluated for Aspergers (which is in the Autism Spectrum), Dyslexia and short term memory loss. (and now I have arthritis on my right knee, too.) My life hasn't been what I imagine it would be but things have gotten a lot better. I live at home with my mother and I have all the support, love and friends I need to help me on my journey to recovery but I think having a pet companion will make my journey more bearable.  


Currently, I found a part-time job working at the happiest place on Earth.....you guessed it, Disneyland! I'm also enrolled in school for the Spring semester at my community college in Long Beach, CA. I decided to major in Nursing. I love and enjoy helping others.    


I hope I can raise and get this all in the works by the end of the year.  


If you could support my GoFundMe by making a small donation and then sharing it on your social media platform, I would greatly appreciate it. I know that the holidays are coming up and money can be tight but please know that even $5 will help me meet my goal. Feel more than welcome to ask me any questions and I'll be more than happy to answer them.

Basic needs,Soon to be separated from my family,"Hello everyone,

Due to a clerical error in the permit application process I will be forced to return to the US for three months. I will be leaving my wife and two daughters in Denmark because my wife works full time and my daughters are in school.

My family is dependent on my income to help cover many basic living expenses and my absence will create financial stressed on top of the emotional stresses of separation.

I am seeking help to ensure my family is taken care of and so my wife can afford additional child care while I'm gone.

If anyone needs proof to my claims I can of course provide it. I am a humble person and feel terrible for asking for help...but I don't know what to do.

Thank you for reading this.

Bills,If anyone knows how it truly feels,"Hey everyone so to make things short and not ramble.This summer I was left almost dead in a hit and run accident that left my 350z completely totaled and even though I had full coverage on the vehicle geico said they couldn’t replace anything on it because it was all aftermarket nothing was stock. It breaks my heart because that was the one thing I had to show in life no matter if I had a job or was homeless or whatever at least I had a car that I built and had won awards at all the local car shows in town. Di bought it back in highschool and it was my baby ever since. My fiancé at the time couldn’t stand the idea apparently of wasting the summer being stuck inside while I healed from fractures in my spine,shoulder,leg,ribs,and hand so she left me. Said that she shouldn’t have to take care of a grown man and that this was a sign we weren’t meant to be. It made things worse when the first two months went by and I didn’t hear from anyone of my friends and I was just alone,sad,defeated and wanting to end it all.i healed up though got a job and soon after was prompted to a team lead at the Qvc call center that shortly after I was asked to part ways from the company because I openly support the lgbtq community and I’m pansexual myself.so now here I am pawning every item I’ve ever cherished to keep paying for my apartment as well as helping my mother with a third of the mortgage. The only problem is I had to spend the couple thousand dollars I had been saving for a new car on my moms house with repairs and now I’m just trying to keep going when I feel like I should just throw in the towel on life at the moment I’m $150 behind on bills and I’m just eating pb&j sandwiches to get by till I start my new job. Guys honestly it’s hard for me to openly ask anyone for help. I’ve always hated the thought of depending or relying on anyone other than myself but guys I need any help I can get. I’m trying to save up for a cheap bicycle from walmart so I can get to and from work as well. I’m just trying to stay afloat when I’m starting to drown.

Basic needs,Family of 5 low on money and food,"Hello everyone 

I do not enjoy asking for help.. I feel embarrassed doing so. I am married and have three kids. This past year has been a challenging year to say the least. We’ve had to contact churches to help pay our rent. We were 700$ behind at one point, luckily that has been caught up. My husband works full time and I am part time. I stay at home during the day to take kids to school and our special needs daughter therapies. She’s still in diapers at 6 and our 1 year is too so those alone are expensive. We do not qualify for SNAP so we are absolutely struggling. My wages will be garnished here very soon because I couldn’t pay a paycheck advance loan. We are in a debt consolidation commitment because we’ve previously done bankruptcy. 

I go to food pantries a lot but a lot of the foods need to be eaten within a day, but I am grateful do not get me wrong. I would LOVE to be able to be able to go grocery shopping and purchase meals and food that will last.

All I’m asking is $5, 10$ or whatever you can help with for food. I have paypal or I can provide an amazon wishlist too. I will work on it today just have gotten discouraged because the other assistance subreddits require you do be minimum of 90 days and I’m only 65 days old. 

Anything is appreciated and I’d be forever grateful. Thank you

It's how I get to work every day and it's a very much needed piece of equipment for me. Without it I can't get to work again to pay my bills and I don't want to lose the small amount of things that I have. I don't make much money just enough to pay my bills and get by. My car was parked in a legal spot but I was just currently in the hospital for 8 days and while I was in the hospital the town i live in had a street fair and they had to tow it. It's money that I just don't have at all, I hardly have money for food even at this point.  I'm not on disability because I already was out once this year for an extended period of time because of the same medical condition. Basically my entire right kidney has turned into a collection of kidney stones and eventually it has to be removed. Please if anyone can help with anything at all, I will be eternally grateful to you. God bless and have a great day"
Misc,Cub Scouts is expensive,"    My 7 year old recently joined Cub Scouts. He hasn’t been much into the various sports he’s tried. However, since joint Cub Scouts, he has been beaming with pride. He’s super into it and I could’t be happier that he enjoys it. The thing is, there are a great deal of items needed to participate in the required activities,. Uniforms are costly as well. My son is a natural leader and I want to provide him the best experience possible. Would you kindly consider donating on his behalf. I also feel bad for a handful of Scouts because they too could use help. Thanks for your consideration. Happy Trails!"
Bills,Need advice/help,"A brief history as to how I got to where I am. Just over 3 years ago my wife, son and I bought our first house, soon after I got very sick and over the course of 3 years I’ve undergone 3 major surgeries. We had our second child in the first year here and a month after my father passed. Now both myself and my wife work full time jobs however the trouble began when I had to take time off for the surgeries and to pay for funeral expenses, my father left everything to my stepmother who moved out of province shortly after as the will stated their estate would go to his and her children after they both passed away. At this point I had to max out and overdraw my accounts to help pay for the expenses and that of my family. I got behind on some bills and can’t seem to get back on track. I have a struck budget and am working as much as I can and still can’t tread water. I have been selling all my non essential stuff to try to help but it’s slow, I’m a musician as a hobby, my father and I used to jam, most of what I’m selling is my gear and drum kit but have had little interest as it’s not cheap and I’m trying to make the most for what I have. I’ve been barely living payday to payday somehow but am overwhelmed as I have to prioritize what bills get paid and which get put off, and now I’m behind on a few with no clue as to how to restore the balance. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.

Also I’m on a throwaway account, I’m ashamed my wife or sibling will find out if I use my real account."

Medical,Friend's health issues,"Good day,

tl:dr I have a friend in Kansas who is having heath issues. She doesn't know where they stem from, but she has been unable to work because of them.

"" I have been very ill the last few months. It started with bronchitis and pneumonia, and that caused a cascade of other hidden ailments. I'm severely anemic, and though I was treating it, it apparently wasn't enough. It raised my iron levels, but my red blood cells are too small, so for the last year my organs have not been receiving adequate oxygen. I'm on a higher dose of iron now, but no results yet. It can take months to work, and given that treatment didn't work after a year, I may need transfusions down the road. I also found out I have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a serious form of fatty liver disease. Luckily we found it before cirrhosis set in. I'm still undergoing testing to see what else might be wrong.

Basically, I'm in pretty much constant pain, have frequent nausea, get dehydrated easily, and can't get very far away from a restroom at any given time. I'll spare you the details, but there doesn't seem to be a pattern to when an attack might occur, so I can't just plan around it. Even light housework and running errands can leave me bedridden for a day or longer. Because of this, I haven't been able to work for months and I'm not sure when I can go back.

I don't have insurance and the medical bills and regular expenses are piling up. My savings are completely dried up. Steven has been a huge help. He picks up shifts when he can, takes care of our dog, cooks, and does pretty much all the housework. Unfortunately, one income just isn't enough.

We're applying for SNAP (food stamps) and assistance for rent and utilities, but it's taking a long time, and most places will only help once in a 12-month period. Anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated.""

Medical,For my 14-yr-old nephew with special needs who requires spinal surgery,"Hi everyone, I've posted this in other subs, but I am hoping this will reach even more kind souls.

This is for my nephew Sam. He has a rare genetic condition called Prader-Willi syndrome. When he was born, the doctors gave him 2 years to live. He proved them wrong and turned 14 this June. It's been a struggle for him since day one, though. He can't really speak or stand/walk on his own, but he's probably the happiest teenager I've ever met.

He needs spinal surgery as soon as possible because of the severity of his scoliosis, which is starting to squeeze vital organs. The procedure isn't available in our country (Philippines), so he has to have it done in Spain (more affordable than the US!).

As you can imagine, the cost is astronomical - 80k euro for the medical fees alone. We're doing all we can to help Sam get the medical attention he needs, and if you can help in any way, we'd be filled with gratitude.

Learn more about Sam, share his story, and donate if you can via this link: [https://gogetfunding.com/i-got-sams-back-sams-spinal-surgery-fundraiser/](https://gogetfunding.com/i-got-sams-back-sams-spinal-surgery-fundraiser/). Our campaign has plateaued, and it would be awesome to get some momentum again so we can get the surgery done by January. 

Anything you can spare - financially, socially, or spiritually - would help a great deal!

Thank you from our whole family."

Medical,Surviving Two Ruptured Brain Aneuryms," 

2015

With no past medical troubles, i came home one afternoon to find my mum red in the face passed out in her own vomit on the living room floor. I provided first aid and within the hour we were in a doctors office discussing a 10% survival and the possibility of considering organ donations. My mother had two ruptured brain aneurysm and was unlikely to survive.

Four difficult months later of ICU and therapy, miraculously she pulled through and we were home.

I am an only child and between my dad we balance a job each at opposite hours and the rest of the time we are home in shifts taking care of mum.

She is somewhat able to move around and do basic tasks but suffers from aphasia, a speech disorder, confusing words, and has trouble moving around much on her own. We live on the 2nd floor and there is no elevator. Basically since coming home in 2016 my mum has left the house on two occasions since we do not own a family car, and it requires both of us to be at home to carry her down two flights of stairs and into a vehicle for a short trip nearby.

It has crumbled us financially having to keep bills paid, speech therapist & physiotherapy. Unfortunately we can no longer afford Physio or the speech therapy for that matter.

What i hope to achieve is to raise an amount high enough to move out of our current rented home & find either a smaller more economical house on either the ground floor or at least with an elevator so its more accessible for mum to be able to get out more often with us. Also we would really like to focus on physiotherapy to provide her with the help she needs be stronger on her feet and more stable.

At this point, every little bit helps.

I ask that you never neglect the ones you care about, and if you are not feeling well, do not just shake it off, get checked out.

Bless you for taking the time to read this novel of a post!

Pets,Slammed with unexpected vet bill - please help if you can,"Hi everyone,

I'm sorry to have to ask this, but I was hoping some of you may be able to help me out.

My sweet dog Bella, a 7 year old Otterhound mix, randomly developed epilepsy around two years ago. Because my mom did not have pet insurance at the time, we now no longer qualify due to her epilepsy being a pre-existing condition.

Bella takes medication 3x daily to help keep her seizures at bay and for the most part it works. Unfortunately a few days ago she suffered a Grand Mal seizure for a prolonged amount of time (generally they're considered very serious if they last longer than a few minutes) and we had to rush her to the emergency vet. She is now stable, but we were slammed with a $1,200 vet bill.

Between my mom and I, we can cover about $750 of the cost, and I just got paid. I'm a waitress, and don't make a whole lot of money. I don't expect the people of Reddit to willingly hand over the extra $450, but if anyone can donate anything at all, I would be SO completely appreciative. We've endured a hard few months financially for many reasons and this just happened at the worst possible time.

I don't know if I'm allowed to put my Venmo here, but I can happily offer it to anyone who may be able to help.

Thank you in advance. <3"

Bills,I'm Fort and I'm in a dire need of money to pay my rent.,"Hello everyone, I’m Fort and I’m starting a new [WordPress.com Blog](https://www.fortnovels.wordpress.com/), for posting translated works. Translating has always been my hobby, and seeing words of one language change into another always filled me with admiration. As such, I thought of starting a WordPress.com blog. I don’t remember when I first became fascinated by the concept of translating, or just languages in general. Computer or Human didn’t matter to me at that time. However, over the years I’ve realized it’s a really fun hobby, and a beneficial skill in this day and age.

Despite the paragraph above, I’m not starting this blog for the sole process of pursuing my hobby. No, I’m doing this because this is my final struggle. I have been dealing with many problems, from lack of money to pay rent that will lead to me being homeless by the 28th of this month, to dealing with stress and anxiety, and also a gallbladder stone that’ll cost me more than my kidneys to get out of my body. Haha…not that I’m willing to sell my kidneys as it’ll only cost me more in the long term.

Some might be wondering why don’t you have a job? It’s because I had to give up school in high school. Yes, you guessed it right, mental and financial problems. Mental problems are in boom nowadays.  
During the second year I became my only family, and the only breadwinner. I couldn’t handle part-time jobs that fed me and my school, and I gave up on the latter. I truly lament that choice till this day.

This and that happened, and earlier this week my landlord handed me an ultimatum. To get out or pay the overdue rent of 4 months. I had been reading novels online for some months whenever I got some free time, and saw that people could make money off of it. It was at that point I thought maybe if I can make enough to just pay the rent from a hobby of mine. Sounds impossible? Yes, even to me, as I’m writing this post, it sounds and seems impossible, and I can see my future as a sweetheart on the street with a comfy quilt just around the corner.

I know this post won’t be read by most, or even laughed at or maybe thought of as scam, or me being not serious enough. Whatever the case may be, I’m tired of living life like a zombie, working tirelessly from day to night every single day and still not making enough to pay my rent or to eat heartily whenever I want. And finally, I don’t want to give up my home as it’s the only place I’ve lived with my parents. With that as my only conviction, I’m shamelessly imploring to anyone who reads this to help me save my parent’s only memento. I don’t need a lot just $2500, but for many even that may be a lot. 

As long as I can get as little as just $1 from a person really wanting to help me, it’ll mean a lot to me. I ask to share this post through link, twitter, facebook, heck maybe even email to people.  
Sharing and spreading this post as widely as possible may restore my faith in humanity. I’ve been treated too badly to believe something as humanity.

I will be translating every single day till the 28th, which is the day I either make it or lose it. If I’m able to survive, I’ll never stop translating. And maybe, probably, I hope I’ll have enough money in a year to maybe redo my schooling years, so I can get a proper job that pays a lot and get done with my gallbladder surgery.

Misc,I have a passion but it seems so far away..,"I have always loved video editing and rendering. I would do lots of 3D animation and its one of my dreams to do those kinds of things one day. It just really sucks because of how expensive of a hobby it is. 

I'm gonna quickly sum up my story. I was admitted to a mental ward for various reasons a couple years ago and in there I became very very involved in drawing. As I got out, I was somewhere that had a PC that could do these kinds of things. It was incredible. Rendering, editing, even gaming! the whole lot. and it was my safe place. making my own creative shit.

It seems so entitled coming out of my lips and I hate myself for wondering what my mental state would be like if I could go through with what I used to cope with the worst of times.

In short, I want to get a PC. A decent one. Not to fancy, just something that can.. fulfil whats been lost? I'm not sure. reddit recommended this sub to me and I thought maybe it was the universe. so worth a shot. if someone out there has a pool of cash (lol) and could help, that would mean the world to me.. god i love reddit <3

Education,Please help me to keetp studying," 

Hello, everyone! I hope you are all having a nice day...I'll proceed to explain my situation. I need money to pay my education. My name is Daniel Hernández and I am 18 years old. I am actually studying journalism at the Arturo Michelena University located in San Diego, Carabobo, Venezuela. My country has been living an economic crisis since 2013 that resulted in what we call humanitarian crisis now. People are starving and eating from the trash and crime and corruption is at it's highest rates. I am a lucky person to have a house and a mom who loves me and takes care of me. I try my best to survive this constant tragedy with a smile on my face and good humour, but it has gotten harder and harder to live decently. I recently got a job as a salesman in a clothing store, I earn 12$ monthly. 12 eggs cost 5 dollars. So you can image how healthy I am eating. I have starved some nights. Even though this whole scenario has made me have suicidal thoughts and develop mental issues I know I, for the most part, have the honour and privilege to have food on the table I started studying the minute I graduated from high school. I am at the sixth semester of my career and I might have to stop studying because I am short of money. Every semester costs up to 20 or more dollars, here this amount is really important, it may sound nonsense but this is what hiperinflation did to our coin. It has no value at all. I also have to use private transport because I do not own a car anymore — we had to sell it — and it costs up to 3 dollars a week. I don't really want to stop studying. I cannot move out now, I don't have the money and also I don't have the documents to do it – which are very difficult to get if you don't have a lot of money – so my only hope is getting my degree and as soon as possible leave the countrt with my mom to seek for a better life...I also have been hapenning to need medicine and funding for my onthodorthic process and mentall illness, if you are interested in helping. 

If you would be able to support me with whatever you want to please contact me — Any questions you have about my situation or any proof you need to proceed and support me please let me know! Thank you so much for reading, I hope you have a nice rest of the day and may God or whoever you believe in, bless your hearts.

**Together, we are raising $50,000 to build a technology center for 1,000 underprivileged youth of the Ojibwe Tribe Boys & Girls Club on Leech Lake Reservation in Minnesota.**   
In the U.S., Native American Reservations have the most urgent need for help. Fewer than 10% of homes on tribal lands have access to internet. The Leech Lake Bank in particular struggles with high rates of alcoholism and drug use, and most of the children in the Boys & Girls Club live in extreme poverty. Only 10% of Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe children go on to higher education (compared to 29% of the general population). Our new center will provide supplies, teachers, training, and support to 1,000 kids in need, inspiring them into higher education, career paths, and greater positive impact on their Tribe.  
My personal goal is to raise $1,000 by September 30th.

Misc,Help Youth Runners and My Wife Get into the New York Marathon,"I'm here looking for some help getting my wife to the New York Marathon.

My wife loves to run and has been hoping to run the New York Marathon for years. She's applied multiple times but has not been lucky enough to get a lottery admission. This year she decided to go the charity route and is raising money for Rising New York Road Runners, which provides free youth program and events to help kids gain confidence and healthy lifestyles.

Unfortunately, she is still more than $1000 away from her required goal of $2620 (26.2 miles, $2620). We've reached out to family and friends and held a few fundraisers so far but it doesn't seem like we'll get to the necessary amount in time. I've been saving a bit but I don't think we'll be able to pay the rest ourselves considering all the other costs associated with flights and hotels.

Medical,Classmate got in a motorcycle accident a few days ago.,"I don't really know how to go about doing this properly but I feel like I should at least try. I've never asked anyone for anything in my life, but I recently started taking welding classes about a month ago and there was someone in my class I noticed was really intelligent and hard-working and I realized this was the same guy who had been dating one of my classmates since before I graduated high school in 2008. He graduated the same year as me, has the same first name, has the same bike as me except 1000cc instead of 600cc, so I thought it all was kind of a cool coincidence.

&#x200B;

The dude busted his ass at work every day, showed up to class, is a funny dude, and has been killing it on all the tests so far. I currently only have a motorcycle so I've been riding it exclusively, which is fine because I'm used to it. Class is Monday-Thursday from 5 to 10 PM. Last Thursday he told me he was going to try and ride his bike the next day, which he did, and we ended up going for a ride on our lunch break. He told me he hadn't even rode his all year which kind of worried me because we both have really fast bikes.

&#x200B;

Anyway, we leave school and I told him I'd ride with him the way he was going but I'd be turning off at an intersection because he lives 15 minutes away from where I do. He was a good distance ahead of me on the highway and was definitely going too fast, and possibly wasn't aware of where the intersections were, but I pulled over into the left lane and started slowing down. This intersection actually has ridiculously poor visibility due to how the ground is inclined. I get a sick feeling before I even saw anything and as I pull up to it can tell the lights and scene I'm seeing aren't right at all.

&#x200B;

I see a car in the middle of the highway and a bike laying on the ground with no rider in sight. I pulled over to shoulder of right the side of the road and see the driver on his phone standing outside of his car obviously on his phone calling for help. Everything is going in slow motion for me and I'm sick to my stomach, 100% sure he is dead and I'm just standing there staring at the scene in front of me. The guy on the phone yells to me, ""can you go be with him?"" and I immediately run to the other side of the car and he's laying there on his stomach. He somehow has his flip phone open and is talking to his girlfriend on speaker and says, ""man, I'm fucked up. I'm so fucked up. Do I look fucked up? Man, please tell me if I look fucked up."" and I'm just telling him that he's going to be OK, he tells me to talk to his girlfriend (who is at the local fair with his little sister and her boyfriend) and I tell her where to go and she told me something to do with her number that I immediately forgot and didn't do. He somehow pulled his own helmet off of his head while I was talking to her.

&#x200B;

He was somehow only probably 20 feet away from the wreck, the upper half of his body on the grass and the lower half on the gravel, and his feet were laying in the road. He asked me to turn him over and I could see blood coming out from under him and figured he had an insane amount of bones broken so I told him that I'm sorry but I can't do it. A fire has somehow started on top of the hood of the car and ends up spreading quickly and I don't know exactly what could happen so I'm standing in front of him in case something blew up because I figured anything hitting him would make sure he was dead. Everything is kind of a blur but the car ended up becoming completely engulfed in flames. The local fire department, state highway patrol, and I assume what is also the fire department (green vests) are the first people to arrive, and a lady tells me to get back.

&#x200B;

The ambulance takes FOREVER to get there, as in his girlfriend who was in the middle of the fair somehow got there directly after. He was taken to a nearby hospital and life-flighted. He suffered severe pelvic damage, damage to his lower body, and a vascular surgeon managed to perform a skin graft to save his right leg. Parts of his intestines were removed and somehow reconstructed. I don't know much about the medical field. I don't know if he suffered spinal damage and I don't want to ask because I'm just hoping he will still be able to walk. His girlfriend has kept things updated on Facebook and it has gone from looking completely bleak with the first day of him being in critical condition, to going out of surgery, to having to go back into surgery.

&#x200B;

He is currently breathing on his own but there's so much stuff going on I don't even know how to explain. Everyone probably thinks we were doing stupid shit and racing but he was far ahead of me and probably just enjoying the freedom of being on a bike. Yes, it was stupid but he has a kid and a girlfriend and she's having to take off work. I have a seriously good feeling he's going to pull through though and everything will be OK in the end.

&#x200B;

I don't even know if I'm in the right place or if this is what this subreddit is for, nor do I even know how to go about organizing something to ask for donations, etc. It's a rough situation to handle and I'd like to be able to help but don't really know where to start."

I’ve been going through some hard times lately that lead me to take money from my savings for college and use them on bills, my next paycheck won’t be for another 3 weeks but I have to pay my last 60 payment for my next 8-week class in the next week. Please, all I really need is 60 to be able to pay for this next class. The next time I get paid I’ll definitely pay you back. 

I was already able to make most of the payments for this class but unfortunately we had a facet break at my house so I had to spend most of my paycheck on that.

Medical,Bring Light to the Darkness of Cancer," 

Hi everyone! 

On October 5th I will be participating in 'Light the Night' sponsored by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society in order to shed light on the darkness of cancer. 

My mother recently passed away from cancer in January. Since her passing, life has been undoubtedly harder for my family and I. She was the brightness in every room that she entered and I am hoping to send a little bit of light up to her. 

By providing a small donation, you can help people like my mom who were impacted by this awful disease. The money raised through Light the Night allows the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to fund treatments for people who are suffering from all forms of blood cancer.

Help me defeat the darkness of cancer, please. Any small donation helps!

Bills,Request to prevent eviction,"Right now I am in dire need of a bit of assistance with my rent. If I don’t have the full amount to them tomorrow, then I will get evicted. I have nearly everything I need but not quite. 

I’ve had a seriously tough couple of years. I lost my Mom in 2015 and I’m still having to pay to sort out probate issues with her things. I went through a bad and long (and expensive) divorce from a manipulative and frightening man after a 10 year marriage. He stole all of our savings and left me with a ton of bills. Then I had to move quickly with all my pets and belongings from a house I thought I’d raise my children in and live for the rest of my life. Luckily I found a new place to live but rent has been difficult the past two months. I didn’t have transportation at all due to an awful car accident (didn’t get anything back since it was an old 90s volvo). I recently found a decent truck to purchase and it was doing great - until it wasn’t all of a sudden - so now I’m still not even sure what the issue is (hoping it isn’t the transmission) but I had to pay to get it towed an hour back to my house. That, along with previously helping my elderly Dad out with a few necessary living expenses, has unexpectedly put me behind in my very tight budget over the past couple months. I’ve borrowed from friends and family, which has been really difficult for me and I’ve lost a lot of pride, but I had to do what I could to survive... I have loans against my 401k. Several things with the divorce process (longer story) has made my credit awful and my one credit card left is maxed and I can’t seem to get any loans. I’m not sure where else I can turn at this point… 

I am employed full time and I’ve been picking up extra hours, so I managed to pay August rent late (along with court eviction filing fees and extra late fees from my rental company). Now I am trying my best to get the September rent paid by tomorrow to prevent the eviction/lock out from proceeding. I would deeply appreciate any help at all to keep me from losing my home. Please message me if you can help me at all…"

I will keep it sort and simple as I have never asked again for money from anyone in my life since i was 16 yo.

I am in need of some money to pay for house deposit. 1000$ is just what I need. I don't want to be kicked out and I will have a job in 3 months.
I even signed a contract with the future employer. But the current landlord won't wait 3 months and has given me 1 month to pay everything.

Pets,I’m up at 4 am typing this... I’m in a dark place and need help.,"I hate asking for financial assistance for my own problems, but I’m desperate. Even if you don’t end up donating, maybe this can be my therapy.

This past year has been the worst in my life. I accept the consequences I’m responsible for, but there has been a pile of unforeseen, unwarranted bad situations too. I’m putting myself through law school, working a part time job that barely paid, and living independently. Finances were tough and life was stressful, but I had a couple of things in particular that kept me going: my boyfriend and my dog.

My boyfriend has supported me through so much: my depression, anxiety, stress, finances, everything and anything. My 4 yo French Bulldog, named Tato, has supported me too. He’s been my companion and a source of joy ever since I got him as a puppy. I have only 2 pictures hanging at work, and they’re of them. 

Well this past weekend, Tato has a strong reverse sneeze attack. He’s had these before, but this one was the worse it has been. He had strained himself so hard during it that he locked up and fell to his side. 

The emergency vets juggled us around, until they finally suspected a herniated disk and possible IVDD. His limbs are paralyzed. I must spoon feed him wet food and bottle him water. He eliminates in his bed because he doesn’t when we hold him up outside. 

The vet recommended and MRI and possible surgery (totaling $7K) which is scheduled for this Thursday. My friends and family have rallied to raise just under $4K, but we are still far from our goal. Even if every person donated just $1 each or shared his GoFundMe page, it would make a world of difference. 

I am still actively pursuing every avenue I can. I’m kicking myself for not getting pet insurance. I applied for Care Credit. I’m considering quitting law school to work full time again. But I’m terrified it won’t be enough and it won’t be fast enough. 

Please, if you understand how dogs can become family and a support system to you, please help Tato at GoFundMe.com/helpTato. 

TLDR; I’m about to lose my dog, who’s family to me and my life’s support. I need help paying for his medical treatment. Please 🙏🏼 (If you’re here to troll, please skip me for today. I’m in a very low place right now.)"

The endoscope is **inserted** through the mouth and down the esophagus, which leads to the stomach. Which then we will pump more nutrition because he has uncontrollable spastic shakes, that just burns all the caloric intake.  


I am devastated because the doctor did give us a fair warning that since he is immobile, he is at a very high risk of infection and the worst part is, he cannot tell us if he is sick, he has never talked nor walked. His name is Aaron Mathher Hernandez he is 6 years old and wheel chaired bound, we live in South Texas, (RGV) and we need funds for  travel and other expenses. The hospital is in Houston (Texas children's hospital), where my wife and son currently are.   


I love my boy he's a happy camper but it has drained us that i gave all i had to my wife and it was not enough, this hurt extra bad, but I ain't going to let this weaken me, I was born a fighter, I have always found a way, i always will but my vision has been obstructed by thick tears. I need some Reddit love to illuminate the path so i can keep going and find a way. 

My wife's sister was kind enough to provide transportation up there and lodging as for me I had to stay here because my 10 year old cant skip school.   


The weight on my shoulders grows exponentially and I will keep truckin with your help of donation or sharing the link will prolong the collapse.   


Thank you for your time. I will be answering questions because i know reddit loves to ask.  


Below is an Facebook link, I hope I am not breaking rules, as I kneel, lips quivering casting this desperate prayer.

Pets,The kitties at the Ladybug Kitty Nursery desperately need your help!!,"In a video circulating Facebook, Eugenia kisses and cuddles a beautiful white and brown cat. She cleans him, dresses him in a diaper (due to urinary incontinence), and a specially designed 'cat-sack' which protects his legs when he drags himself around on the floor. This is the day-to-day norm at **Ladybug Kitty Nursery**, an independent volunteer project run out of Eugenia's own house!  Her mission is to provide temporary shelter and medical care to Romania's unwanted and abandoned cat population while they await adoption. Some of the cats are perfectly healthy, while others come to her with special needs such as blindness, amputation, FIV+, cancer, urinary incontinence, etc. Sadly, many of the issues these cats have are due to human cruelty.

&#x200B;

*How did Ladybug Kitty Nursery begin, you ask?*

&#x200B;

*It all started in 2014 when Eugenia saved a paralyzed cat that was attacked by a pack of dogs in front of her house. She had no money to see a vet, didn't even know of a vet caring enough to be trusted with such a special little cat! She realized there was no place for special needs cats to go after being rescued, so she took it into her own hands. And after this cat was adopted, others started to hear about the wonderful gift Eugenia had given it and wanted to help.*

&#x200B;

*She decided to call her project the Ladybug Kitty Nursery, in honor of that first kitty, Ladybug.*

&#x200B;

Eugenia can't do it on her own, though. She needs help! She relies heavily on donations for the things these cats need, such as litter, diapers, wipes,  cleaning supplies, cat toys, towers, pee pads, pillows, blankets, etc!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**9/10/2019 HELP NEEDED URGENTLY!**

&#x200B;

There has been an outbreak of panleukopenia at the Nursery!  5 out of the 6 kittens who showed symptoms have already passed (Mumy, John, Mina, Micu, Amy Lee).

&#x200B;

Panleukopenia is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease caused by the feline parvovirus. Kittens and unvaccinated cats are most severely affected.  THIS is why your donations are so dearly needed and appreciated, to help keep these babies healthy.  Unfortunately, due to no fault of Eugenia's (some kittens do not have up-to-date shots due to receiving antibiotics at the time, or they were underage) the virus has been allowed to spread.

&#x200B;

Every cat brought to the Nursery has tested negative for  panleukopenia, otherwise they wouldn't have been taken in, as Eugenia knows that this is an absolute nightmare for a cat fosterer. Mumy unexpectedly tested positive a few days ago and sadly has since passed. Any cats that begin to show symptoms are moved upstairs to the quarantine room where they recieve fluid therapy, antibiotics and a hyperimmune serum that has proven to be highly effective. Unfortunately, however, cats are still dying.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Right now the cats at Ladybug Kitty Nursery need your help more than ever.  There are vet bills that need to be paid, air purifiers that they desperately need, as well as stainless steel food bowls, etc.  Essentially anything these cats have come into contact with needs to be destroyed. Eugenia is hard at work sanitizing everything that can be salvaged.

&#x200B;

Any and all donations are tremendously appreciated! After all, don't forget this is an independent project run from Eugenia's own house! She's doing the best she can, but she needs our support!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are several ways you can help:

&#x200B;

Basic needs,26 year old primary provider for family,"Hello everyone and happy saturday.

My story is this: I currently have a car that i’m paying $322 a month on. This car is at risk of getting repo’d due to late and missed payments. I have decided to return this car to the bank before they take it.


This means I need a car. I want to buy a used car with cash so i no longer have payments to worry about.
I have found a great car for just under 6k. My goal is to raise 7k to have wiggle room for taxes, fees, etc. anything I don’t use, I will donate back to causes on this subreddit.

The reason I need a car is because I have 2 jobs and go to school (school started tuesday). Without a car, i will lose my jobs, my insurance, and my ability to provide for my disabled mother and autistic brother.

This is very time sensitive, as my car will be repo’d soon, i fear. PLEASE help. I can provide images of negative bank balances, current status of payments, current credit score (cant get a loan and have no cosigner), declined letter for loan, and the car i’m trying to get before someone else buys it.

misc,Help my brother move away from an unhealthy living environment,"My brother is 23, autistic, and living with our parents.  In the next three months or so our parents are planning to move to Georgia (we live in Florida) and they intend for my brother to go with them.  He absolutely does not want to go, our dad travels a lot for work and often is away for long periods of time, which would mean he would usually be stuck at home with our mom.  She’s narcissistic and controlling, and over the past few years her behavior has taken a serious toll on my brother’s mental health.  He feels stressed and depressed much of the time, and an environment where it would only be him and our mother at home for long stretches of time would, we both think, have a very negative impact on him.

He does have a job, but he rarely gets scheduled despite being part time.  He gets one shift every week or two, and hasn’t had much luck in picking up from his coworkers.  He’s trying to save up money so he can afford an apartment with some roommates, but currently only has about $400 to his name (a lot of which goes toward his car payments + insurance).  I’m also trying to help him financially here and there when I can, but I’m also in the midst of moving apartments and am transitioning jobs at the moment.  He’s hoping to have at least $1,500 saved up by the time our parents are ready to leave, but he’s extremely worried that if things don’t work out with his job that he might not make it.  It’s this desperation that led to him letting me make this post in the first place; usually he doesn’t like taking from strangers.

If you are willing to donate his venmo and cashapp are both under ChaosHero236.  I really don’t want to see my brother be forced to leave his job and friends and home, so any little bit helps.  Thank you."

misc,Help me get my aspie bf a telescope for his bday!,"gofundme.com/telescopeforjames

My boyfriend, James, and I have been dating this time around for a year now, but our story starts 12 years ago. We dated briefly way back when we met in grade 8. Immaturity, timing and bad decision-making left us going our separate ways, but little did we know we both considered each other our soul mates all these years. We completely lost contact, but fast forward to a year ago, we ran into each other at the grocery store. We both couldn’t believe who was standing in front of us (you could see it on our faces) and rambled on about where we were in our lives and updated each other a bit, and then parted ways again. That day started a whirlwind of emotions in both of us, and we began messaging and opening up about how we never forgot each other and hoped to one day be brought back together again. And here we are! He literally treats me like a princess, and I’ve never known a human who better intertwines with everything I am. We love all the same things (including, but not limited to: french-press coffee first thing in the morning, going metal detecting, doing trash clean-ups in the streets, painting, tending to our garden, cooking, hiking, camping and having bonfires, looking at the constellations etc). James has high functioning aspergers, and he makes me proud every single day. For example, he just filed a bullying report about a coworker of his that he witnessed bullying another coworker, who, James thinks is on the autism spectrum because of certain behavioural cues. He didn’t stand for it at all, and immediately reported it. I’m not only proud of who he is, but proud to be his girlfriend. He makes every day count, and reminds me to not take life so seriously. To put this into perspective, a regular grocery store trip just to grab bread is easily turned into a big fun fest with me - and strangers within earshot - literally in hysterics because he has no filter (he is an aspie after-all) and he’s the most hilarious person I know. He makes a positive impact on everyone he meets, I’m sure of it. But I’m here to ask for your help. He gives so much, and I want to be able to give back to him! I’m a student with a part-time minimum wage job, and he is a full-time minimum-wage worker. We definitely have enough money to be content and live comfortably for now, but I don’t have anywhere near enough to splurge on anything to spoil him on his birthday for being such a wonderful human (on my birthday he bought me a beautiful opal promise ring - how can I top that?!). So his birthday is coming up and I want to surprise him with a really amazing telescope! A specific one he has mentioned is the Celestron Nexstar 8SE which are $1,500. He’ll tell anyone who will listen about his passion for stars and planets and owning a really good telescope one day. When he talks about it his whole face lights up, and I just want to be the one to open him up to that whole new world through the lens of a telescope. When the night sky is clear, you’ll see us out on our front deck with his binoculars, trying to get a closer look at the stars and the moon - but I want to give him better than that! Please help me make his dreams come true :)"

education,Help me achieve my dreaming of studying abroad,"I am an Algerian software engineering student. **I need your help in order to take a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity** to attend the Computer Professionals Program in the Maharishi University of Management in Iowa, USA, this university extending a special offer to Alergians who apply for the November entry.

[You can check the program's website here](https://compro.mum.edu/)

However, the money needed to sign up for the program is usually $3500-$7000, **but with this special offer I only need to pay 2000$** (plus another 2000$ for personal use when I am there since I won't have any way of getting money when I am there till I get a part-time job or something) My family cannot afford the fees, they are barely feeding us and getting the necessities we need since they are both deaf and mute so it's harder for them to work than normal people, and as a practicing Muslim, I cannot take out the kinds of loans with interest that are usually offered to students, because charging or paying interest is not allowed in our faith. I’m asking for your help with $2000 of those fees.

I have worked hard in university for 3 years just to get an opportunity like this! This is my chance to build a bright future for myself and my family. It has been my dream to study abroad, and money is the only thing keeping me from following that dream now. Please help me with any amount of money you can donate, even if you can't donate I would appreciate it if you just shared it amongst the people you know. The deadline closes on November 2019.

Edit: some people here might think that my post has no meaning and other people should get attention while I don't deserve it because my campaign is stupid, I just wanted to mention this, maybe you don't know how it is to be in a poor family, here in Algeria it's so hard to find a job even if you do, you won't be able to keep up with the monthly expenses especially for my parents and they really did everything for me, I want to at least repay some of their kindness before they pass away and I want to relieve them of their stress and help them out, they are growing old and they won't be able to work anymore so it's up to me as the older son to help my family and I really can't do that in Algeria, I need to finish my studies abroad and get a decent job so I can help them with everything I can, I am not asking for a lot, **if each person here donated 1$ it would mean a lot to me, it will just take 2000 people donating** but even if it doesn't at least the small money I gathered might bring me close to my goal, if you don't like this post or think it's stupid just ignore it please \^\^

This woman was my friend at the nursing home we are employed at she was a certified nurse aid and always had a gigantic smile despite the stresses of her job. Sadly on saturday the 10th of August her and her 10 year old son were murdered in their own home for seemingly no reason. the main suspect who is still on the run in her stolen car at this time is her stepson he faked his death on facebook to buy time and is still at large. There are many questions that nobody has the answer to right now but all we can do is try to get as many donations as possible to help with funeral costs. Please help if you can.

education,Animation Studio Business for civic education," 

I\`d like to set up a private animation studio that will be involved in the production of animated media. I will conceive products to produce, own the physical equipment for production, employ operators for that equipment, and hold a major stake in the sales or rentals of their animation works.

The pilot project of my animation studio will be to create animated and explainer civic education videos that will reach the ordinary man and woman. This is because I have seen that most people are unaware of their basic civil, human and fundamental rights in my country.

I\`d like to combine civic education with short animation videos to reach many people and make them aware of their rights and obligations as a citizen of my country, as well as other important matters for example, matters that are of public interest and affect them directly such as changes in law, regulations and other things that they might not have otherwise been informed.

My objective is to build a world class animation studio that will be known to produce top – notch animation contents and to become the number one choice for TV and online platforms.

If you have any questions or clarifications, please PM me.

Thank You.

misc,Desperately Need Help To Get Out Of Crisis | All Help Would Be Appreciated,"To all the generous members of this sub-reddit,

I am a 30-year-old guy from Pakistan. I've been working as a freelance web content writer from home for the past 11-12 years. Presently, I am primarily supporting my household, which includes my parents. There have been a lot of ups and downs in my life, perhaps even some highs, but somehow I've managed to help make ends meet.

Shortly before April though, I wound up losing a major source of my income. So, I decided to invest some money into my own blog/website, for which I had to purchase a domain and web hosting. I was fairly certain and hopeful that I'd finally manage to earn a decent monthly income, while also creating something of my own.

Unfortunately, I haven't managed to earn anything feasible from it. Yet, I haven't given up hope and am working hard on getting it off the group. My blog/website is just 3 months old, so I am still hopeful and positive that this venture will eventually prove to be fruitful. I am also an author and I've published some erotica, but it isn't too lucrative yet either.

Getting to the point though. I know this may sound bad and wrong, but for my own personal reasons, I had to lie to my parents and I've claimed that I've managed to earn $1,200 over the course of the past 2 months or so. It may not make sense why to you, but although I'm the one earning, my father handles the household budgeting and financing.

Hence, considering that I do not have $1,200, I now find myself in a crisis. Once again, it is too complicated to explain, but my parents will flip if they discover that I do not have the money I claim to, which will lead to dire circumstances. Consequently, I've been experiencing tremendous anxiety and depression since the past week or so. I don't mean to exaggerate or gain unfair sympathies but I've been feeling a bit suicidal because I feel like my world is collapsing around me, which may end up being true.

The reason I decided to state all of the above is to explicity present my current situation and why I decided to post here, and also for the sake of utmost transparency. I know that there are probably far more deserving causes and charities that deserve attention and monetary assistance. I never imagined that I'd find myself in a situation like this, but I'm utterly desperate and panicking.

TL;DR: I am in desperate need of coming up anywhere between **$800** and **$1,200** within the next few days. I know this practically impossible, but this is kind of my last resort, so I thought I'd give it a try, in any case.

The money I receive is supposed to go towards my household expenses and rent for the month of August 2019. This is somewhat unrelated, but my father was recently diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes, so I need to begin saving money for his surgery as well. If manage to get through this crisis and raise enough money, I have vowed to turn my life around and secure a more stable source of income.

As I am in Pakistan, I cannot create a GoFundMe at the moment, but I will ask a friend of mine in the U.S. to do so. Once again, I know it is probably impossible to raise **$1,200** within 3 to 4 days but if anyone here might be generous enough to contribute any sort of amount in order to get me out of this predicament, here is the PayPal email of the same friend: roswell250@hotmail.com

To anyone who decides to help me out, I will be forever be grateful and obliged. I may not be able to pay you back, perhaps, but I promise to pay it forward some day. While it is not mandatory, if anyone does decide to transfer an amount, it would be helpful if you could leave a comment below and mention the amount. That way I could inform my friend and above all, thank you for your contribution.

I am really afraid and panicking, and feel really helpless and don't know what to do. It's like all the happiness has been sucked out of my life because as I've stated, my life might as well be literally over, and I don't mean to exaggerate. Anyhow, I won't drag this any further.

Kind Regards and utmost gratitude to anyone who may help."

I've been staying at a Mountain Sanctuary, and they're willing to let me use their mailing address while I'm here, but I only have until this Friday (07/19) before they're asking me to leave so there is room for new guests. Once I place the insurance claim, the phone is shipped over night. So I really only have today to finish trying to raise the money.

bills,St. Vincent DePaul Question,"Good morning and thank you for taking the time to read this. I'm in a bit of a desperate situation and was asking for advice from friends and family when I heard of St. Vincent De Paul. I have until Thursday to come up with a significant amount of money as Friday I'm due in eviction court. My two roommates decided to move out on me right before Christmas, leaving me to pay 2/3 more of rent that I was not expecting to pay and due to the Holiday did not have in the bank. I've notified my landlord about the situation, and they don't care (its a business obviously and I get it). I've been denied for loans online, pawned of what I could and I still find myself searching the couch cushions for change in tears . i have contacted 211 but based on my income I was overqualified for rent assistance. Then I heard of St. Vincent and found a local office. So mainly the point of the post is just to ask if anyone has used them before and know the rules/qualifications. I checked out their website and saw something about a month wait.. Does anyone know if that's accurate? Or of any other organizations that may be able to help in a more prompt way?"

Due to my family member's lease agreement, I can only stay one more week, out of the two originally intended. 

I am looking for any type of help in finding a place to stay that I can rent which will let me slide on a week or two at first or a transitional house or halfway house that offers grants or a sliding scale based upon my income.

I am a type 1 diabetic and my health is most important to me. I am drug free and clean. I just want to get back up on my feet I am almost there I don't want to lose the progress I have made getting out of a bad situation and creating a whole new better one from scratch.

The homeless shelters I had gotten in contact with are all waiting list only which doesn't help me at this point.

Any tips, advice or help is much appreciated before I end up on the streets in the cold thank you."

basic needs,Requesting help with food and diapers ( family of 6 ),"Hello to anyone reading, I hope you're having a great day :) I've been sitting here thinking about should I post or not. I have received help here before, and I just received a little in the comments of this sub. I just wanted that to be known. I don't want to ask again, but god knows i need to! Short story on why I'm requesting. My husband is the bread winner, and he has always got us by just fine,( family of 6 ) but his work slowed down and he's making less than half of what he normally does. Pay checks have always been an inconsistent amount just because he gets paid for whatever job he does, individually, but the amount he's been getting isn't enough to live off of and it is catching up to us really fast!  Work is slowing picking back up ( he is looking for a better paying job with a SET pay right now) but that isn't going to help us at the moment! I do market research and surveys online right now to try and help, I'm almost to the 25 dollar limit to cash out on my app, but it is going to take a couple days to get there ( you only get a couple surveys a day)  and then up to 3 days for a posted payment. My husband just applied for a small loan threw his retirement to help us out of the hole this has put us in, but that could take weeks. We paid our rent and 1 other bill ( couldn't pay my car insurance because the money just isn't there) and we literally have no money left at ALL! If anyone could help with some food items, diapers and basic household items, I would be so grateful! You have my word that I will pay it forward as soon as we get threw this!

bills,Digging myself out of a hole,I'm new to Reddit and stumbled across this sub and thought it may be worth a shot because honestly I don't know what else to do. About 3 months ago I got a new job. It's a dream job and it kind of just fell into my lap. Because I wasn't expecting to switch jobs I didn't have enough money for the gap in pay checks so I overdrew my bank account and I've been trying (with a little success) to get ahead. A couple days ago I got a letter from the bank letting me know if I don't pay off my overdrafts in 14 days they will be going to collections and I really do not want that to happen. I was overdrawn about $700 but I've managed to get it down to $350. I do still have bills coming in so that also makes it hard to keep my account positive when a big chunk of my checks are going to paying off the overdraft but $350 will just about cover it. I know it's quite a bit of money but anything helps and I would be so so grateful if anyone could help me.

basic needs,Need Advice/Some Kindness,"I guess I just need to get this off my chest and maybe get some kind words and a bit of advice.

I got home from work on Friday to find that my girlfriend had gone, packed all her stuff and just left. I'd had suspicions that she'd been cheating on me, but as yet I don't know whether that is or isn't the case as to why shes left me. She'd left a letter saying she didn't love me anymore. We had a joint bank account, my pay that went in on Friday was completely cleared out leaving me with nothing.

Over the weekend I've applied for a new bank account, so I can tell my work to pay me into this bank account going forward but I just can't believe someone I loved and thought loved me would screw me over like this. I don't even have the money for my bus fares to work next week so it's gonna mess me up financially in the longer term too.

Aside from the bank situation what else do I need to do? She didn't leave her house key, I guess I should change the locks when I have the money to do so? What about until then? What happens if she tries to come into my house? I don't want to see her at all, I'm so hurt. Also foodbanks, can anyone just turn up to them? I've had a look in my area and the one I can find is open on Tuesdays and Thursdays but doesnt specify if you can just walk in?

Does anyone have any suggestions on sites/things that can be done to try and make at least my bus fare? I'm a member of Qmee, where you can take surveys and cash out any amount but weekends are slow and so far I've only made 11p. I just dont know what to do.

I guess I also just want to hear from others that have maybe been in similar situations that things will get better? That even though I feel like my world is falling apart now, that I'll be okay. Because right now I don't feel like I will be."

This coming week is the last week of being broke but I can’t make it. I spent all my money, maxed out all my credit cards, had to take my dog to the vet unexpectedly and borrowed as much as I could. This weekend I tried skipping a meal a day but that’s just giving me a horrible headache. There’s no way I’m going to be able to work all week without more food, it’s a physically demanding job. I’d be more embarrassed to beg like this if I wasn’t so hungry as I type this.

pets,This is my cat Buurtpoes. She needs your help...,"Hi, this is my cat named Buurtpoes, which means Neighbourhood Cat! She is a stray that my boyfriend and I took in after we found her roaming the streets around his neighbour (hence the name, and naming credits to my boyfriend’s little sister). We decided to take her in and she’s been with us about half a year now.

However, she has gotten very sick. She first got sick a few weeks back and we took her to the vet as we were concerned. They thought she might be stressed due to us recently having moved, gave her the appropriate medication, and we thought that was that. But then, a week later, she got sick again but worse this time. We took her to a vet again but as they were unsure what it could be, they gave her another set of medication and treatments, along with blood work and a specific diet. But she did not improve and has only gotten worse. 

Our vet has now recommended to us for her to see a specialist, starting of with a scan for which a specialist needs to come into their clinic to perform, that will need to be followed up with possible surgery or special consultations through a specialist clinic. Along, of course, with more medication and treatments. Our vet told us that for merely the scan, it would already be a cost of £250,- without any added costs of the actual appointment or treatments. We’re already £450,- into medical bills and are at a loss of what to do.

We care about our cat very much, so as a hopeful resort we turn to reddit. If you are able to, donating a just a few pounds would help us out immensely. If you aren’t able to, just sharing this post would mean a lot. Thank you for reading this.

bills,Need $80 to stop eviction ASAP,"Edit: update! Thanks to u/sashagreyhound I only need $67.00. Like I said, every bit helps. I’ve gone ahead and posted requests on a few other subs hoping to find anybody willing to contribute a little bit here or there. We appreciate everything!

Update 2: A redditor who wishes to remain anonymous donated $20.  Only $47 to go.  Please, someone contribute something.  We are so very close.  Even if we don't get it all today I just want to thank everyone who has helped even a little.

Just what it says. My fiancée and I have been in some tough times lately. We have got most of our rent together but since it’s already late this month the office won’t give us an extension. We need $80 to complete the payment first thing tomorrow morning.  Every bit helps so if you can toss in $10 or $20 please help."
basic needs,Could really use some food tonight. Hell anything to eat would be great.,Ive been eating once a day for the past week due to my wife quitting her job due to a mental break down. ive tried random acts of pizza and i got a coupon but i literal have under 2 dollars in my account. I get paid Friday and i really hope she gets approved for unemployment tomorrow because if we dont get that 200 dollars im gonna be in real trouble... Im working on getting her on disability as well. but that could take months.

medical,"I really just wanted to help others and am so thankful I did, but now find myself needing some small assistance after getting sick.","I was hospitalized with a deep tissue infection, and just want to be home with my pups and my children but unless I am able to get all of the required medications to make sure this infection stays at bay. After a new amazing job, my health insurance is not active and this bill alone is going to be thousands of dollars out of pocket, and going with the cheapest possible supplies, and required medications I have almost everything covered and am around $125 short which leaves us with close to nothing for a few days but hey, I will be home with my kids and my pups and hopefully healing and getting better. This has by far been the worst sickness I have ever had, fevers, nasty infection pocket, lancing, stitches, the whole 9. Will be returned 100% and then some in paying it forward!

basic needs,I'm about to be evicted,"Hello all. Ive tried everything. Community resources have denied me. I havent gotten any response posting on here. I have put $50 toward it but that is all i can seem to get together from friends/family.

Ive called the local shelters and, being dead of winter, they are all full. I was asked if i had a car I vould sleep in, I do not.  I dont know what to do. I am starting a new job but the position wont be available until Feburary. I'm looking for something in the mean time but nothing will be in time to save me. I still need $550 to cover this months (January's) rent. I live in NE Ohio. Any help at all would be beyond appreciated. I was able to get my utilities taken care of (I was put on PIPP for gas and electric and get government phone and food stamps will kick in in February). I just need this bit of help to get me through. Next month I hope to be able to pay it forward. I just have no other options. Reddit you are my last resort. Thank you so much for reading."
misc,Need help getting to Indiana [reposting now that I have appropriate karma],"I'm trying to get my fiance out to Indiana so that he can start work, and get us a place. We're homeless as of about 7:30am on 1/13/2020. 2/3 family members have a place to stay, but he doesn't. (We were planning on him flying out tonight, but funding fell through) So, we're hoping to get him on a flight/bus/train before he has to stay outside too long. We're expecting snow, so time is a big factor for this aspect.

Now that details are out, here's the specific ask: Can anyone help me get my fiance to Indianapolis, IN from Portland, OR? Plane, train, bus, rideshare, anything will do. Just trying to start a better life.

Feel free to ask any verification questions necessary. I can provide screenshots of conversations that prove the situation going back for weeks. 

Thank you for reading, and sorry if I come off desperate, it's just that I am. Hope everyone is doing well either way. <3"
pets,Trying to help a friend save his dog.,"So my friend's dog has been having leg problems for a year. He's gone to so many vets to find out the problem and he recently found a vet who was able to identify the problem. She has torn both her acl's.  He found out the surgery will cost 6000$.   He loves his dog and is willing to clear out his entire savings but hes still a bit short.  If anyone could toss 5 dollars towards him or even share the link to his gofundme that would be incredible.    Thank you guys so much.

basic needs,Urgently in Need of Financial Help!,"Hey all, it's VERY unlike me to make this sort of post and I honestly feel terrible asking any of you this, but me and my three housemates desperately need help. 
- one of my housemates was hospitalized after an accident and is currently unable to work as a result and the medical bills are expensive. (I don't know how much, I would have to ask)
- we are currently down a car (see: accident) so the one housemate needs to take Ubers and Lyfts to get anywhere since the rest of us are unable to a majority of the time. That car is still in impound on a 600 plus bond (more by the day)
- I currently am unable to work due to my mental health and therefore unable to contribute to rent or much else of anything other than helping around the house 
- that being said, we have been having struggles meeting the needed amount every month. Collectively speaking it costs over 2.5 grand and it's common for us to be up to $300-400 short.
- we barely have any food in the house because none of us can afford to buy groceries or even spare a fast food place anymore. There are four of us and all of us are declining in weight, and it's especially alarming for me because I'm already dangerously low as far as that goes.
- one of my housemates has a major surgery coming up and, since the deposit has already been put down and has been on a waiting list for years now, it cannot be postponed. Whatever doesn't go to rent is prioritized to go towards that since the deadline is fast approaching.
- the other day we had to pay upwards $1000 because our power got shut off and our water is about to be shut off too but we cannot afford to pay it. We don't know how we're going to pay rent now. 
- we aren't able to pay for our medications half the time even though collectively only ends up being about $20, it's still sometimes nothing we can do for.

We are in a really really rough patch right now and could use all the support that you are willing or able to give. Of course there is absolutely no obligation, but any donations would be greatly considered. Every penny counts. If wanted, I also do art commissions if they are requested.

If that is an option you would like to take up, please just PM me

pets,My dog needs emergency vet care. He is my emotional support animal and I can't lose him...,"I have had Chewbacca for over seven years, since he was only 8 weeks old. He has always been there for me. He knows when you're upset or hurting and does everything he can to comfort you. He is my best friend and now he needs my help. For the past week or so I noticed a decrease in his appetite and a general lack of energy on his part. Yesterday I took him to our vet and dished out $210 to pay for an exam and bloodwork. They called me today and said that his levels were not good and he has an infection that is attacking his kidneys and is close to entering kidney failure. They need me to bring him back immediately to begin treatment which includes emergency hospitalization, constant monitoring, IV fluids and antibiotics. They are estimating he will need to be hospitalized for at least 3 days and the treatment cost will be $1,100 at the very least. There is no way I can afford that. I dont want my baby to suffer and I'm not ready to give him up or let him be put down. Please if you can find it in your heart to help Chewie I will be forever grateful. I'm praying for a miracle.

basic needs,[REQ] $30-$40,"I'm requesting help in the form of about $30-$40 to help get me through the coming week until my next paycheck. My bank account is negative & I was planning on using my credit card for food, gas, picking up prescriptions I need tommorow, etc until I get paid this coming Fri (the 17th).

Unfortunately my bf is also a card holder on my credit account & unknowingly spent the last of the small limit I had left on it. He did'nt do this on purpose. Just did'nt know it was so close to maxed(it's a very low limit card). 

So I'm asking for help to make it through the week until I get paid. If anyone can help with any amount whatsoever that would be really amazing! But the $30-$40 is what I have calculated I really need to buy food, get to my Dr's appt & pick up my medication from the pharmacy/Dr's, and the gas to do all of this.

If anyone can help I would really be so incredibly grateful & you would be helping me out of a really tight spot! I especially NEED to get to my appt & get my meds as I really need them & take them daily..I'll have a hard time functioning during the week if I miss my appt and/or am unable to get my meds cuz I can't pay for my prescription."

misc,Need part to fix my truck so I can start new job next week,"Well.. I do HVAC work in florida.
During this time of year work is scarce.. its neither hot nor cold.
I was offered to start monday doing a different job in the field that would pay almost as twice as much as I've been making. Mainly because ive only been getting 20 hours a week lately ..
It's been a rough year for me. I broke my hip..had surgery.. all the follow up visits I complained about my knee not my hip so six months after the surgery finally the doctor listened to me.. I had been doing rehab and then working for 6 months with a torn meniscus and partially torn acl.

Well finally recovered from that financially and physically.. then christmas came.. I have 3 kids..one is mine..the other 2 are my wives from a previous relationship..guy beat her..was a drug addict..died from an overdose..I love them like they are my own though.
Kids aged 2 (mine) 5 and 6. 
So we did our best to get them a nice christmas with help of their grandparents but it set me way behind.
While driving home from work a few nights ago..I thought I'd ran out of gas..
My brother came and towed me in...

After spending the last bit of money I had on gas..turns out it wasnt even that.
The alternator went out on my truck.

A few days before I'm about to take on this new job with much better pay that would enable me to take care of my family..
Me and her have been not eating much just to feed the kids.
My phone has been turned off for almost a month now.
My wife's kids grandparents paid to keep our internet and buy the kids a lot of materialistic stuff that money could be better spent on.
This entire month the day I get my paycheck I have had an anxiety attack. Because I know just to feed the kids and keep the lights on..I'll have to give up my entire check..
My main fear right now would be the fact I havent been able to pay my car insurance and in florida that gets your license suspended.

But my truck wont even work and I'm supposed to start this new job mon or Tuesday.

So I would ask anyone that can please help me buy this part to fix my truck so I can get to my new job.

The cost is around 100 to 150 dollars.

I've tried everything..I used to collect comics and only had a few left..put them for sale online at a price cheaper than I paid for them. But no one is bitting.

My parents and I dont speak. I was raised by my grandparents and dropped out of college to take care of then as they passed away both slowly and painfully.

Know it sounds like a sob story maybe but I can prove it all. 

It just sucks to work as hard as I have breaking my body..and now my mind to try to take care of these children.
I also have PTSD from the experience with my grandparents and horrible anxiety...I have been off my medication for a month and a half now because of work being so slow and trying to give my kids a decent christmas.

But I cant lose this job.... if anyone can help every little bit matters. 
Please dm if you can help.

God bless you and this sub for even giving me a chance to make this post.

Sincerely 
Justin."

Loan,Help my Mum.,"This is long...

My Ma is a sweet, sweet woman. She has survived a couple of abusive relationships and come out the other side still so nice and generous. She got herself in to debt through decisions made when she was married to my stepdad, an arrogant, feckless, coward who would spend a large portion of his salary on beer and cigarettes and then force my mum to go and ask friends and family to borrow money, and also I to borrow money from banks. This lack of money meant she got behind on her rent and council tax (we’re in the UK). These past few years she managed to work herself to being debt free through working hard at her job and being very careful with her money. 

At the end of 2018 her car was starting to become more and more prone to breaking down, which is not good as she works an hour drive from her home and there’s no public transport to get her there. She did some research and saw that she could take a loan to buy a new one from her bank. She borrowed £10,000, with the intention of buying a new, reliable car, and paying off other debts.

My brother’s girlfriend (I’m not sure how much his role is in this but certainly she was the main player and is, in my opinion, a nasty piece of work - she treats her kids like shit for a start, smokes in the house and in the car with them, swears at them, and generally cannot wait to get someone else to look after them.) was around when my mum took the loan. Now, my brother’s girlfriend used to have a business selling computers which was actually a way to exploit a tax loophole. It’s not something I fully understand. But until not long before the end of 2018 she was earning A LOT of money. Honestly, i was impressed, and amazed that someone like my brother and his girlfriend would be quite so smart and proactive. It wasn’t necessarily easy, so I hear, as took time and effort to build up. However, as 2018 came to a close, the money stopped coming. At first the story was that the Inland Revenue (tax office in the U.K.) had found an erroneous paper, which the girlfriend had filed “by accident” and was actually not a completed transaction. So the Inland Revenue wanted to check everything that had been filed by my brother’s girlfriend (she did the paperwork). I guess you can see where this is going. Now she swore that there was nothing else, it was an accident. And my Mum, sweet as she is believed her. There’s also the fact that my brother’s girlfriend had helped my Ma a few times when she had trouble with money. And the kids of my brother and his girlfriend (they’re so. Damned. Sweet!). Of course my Ma does not want to see them suffer because their parents are going through some difficulties! So the girlfriend asks my Ma if she can borrow a few hundred pounds for bills, and will pay it back when the Inland Revenue completes it’s investigation and releases the money they supposedly owe my brother’s girlfriend. Then it’s a few hundred to fix her car. Then Christmas presents. Over the course of three months the girlfriend borrows £6000 of the money my Ma has borrowed (if you’re wondering, my Ma has little time as she leaves for work at 10am and returns at 8pm weekdays, and often works Saturdays too, plus she was working any overtime available, and this left little time for car shopping - she did try a couple out). How it got so far I don’t know. When I ask her she says “I can’t see my grandkids suffer” and “she says she’ll pay me back”. Of course it has now transpired that the girlfriend was committing tax fraud, submitting fake receipts in with the real ones to boost her income. Now my brother’s and his girlfriend’s relationship has broken down it has transpired that also a lot of their “business” income was actually borrowed money, money which he is paying back and leaves him with nothing to help pay back my Ma.

Now my Ma is saddled with paying back a £10,000 loan which she never really got to see the benefit of.

I send her money each month to pay off what I owe her as she helped me too, over the past few years, and I’m now in a situation where I can pay her back. But she still is working full time, and because her main job has cut back on overtime, she is working a second job as a cleaner and is looking for a third. My Ma has been through so much in her life, and suffered so much at the hands of people who were supposed to love and protect her, as well as been taken advantage of by people who saw her kindness as weakness. I wish I could do more, but there is no option for me apart from to send her what I don’t spend on myself each month but it’s not much after rent and bills (and I live a minimal lifestyle - I cycle everywhere rather than taking public transport, rarely go out, don’t buy the most expensive food, exercise at home rather than going to the gym, I even take my own coffee out rather than buying it).

If there’s anyone out there who can help in ANY way, it would be very much appreciated!

Thanks for you time,

Anyway I’ll start with some backstory. so my sister who has muscular dystrophy, is also diagnosed with depression and anxiety. she has an assistance dog, his name is Pluto he’s a blue heeler and the most precious dog alive. he first came into the family for training so he would be able to assist my sister with her difficulties caused by her muscular dystrophy. but soon after my sister was diagnosed with depression and made an attempt to take her own life that’s when Pluto stepped up and took on more responsibilities. She got put on suicide watch and Pluto was trained to alert us when she was in bad moods, was hurting herself and even if she made an attempt to take her own life. Pluto has saved her life on 2 occasions by alerting us that she’s harmed herself. Which made us able to call emergency services in time to save her. But anyway that’s enough backstory, so I’m sure most of you are well aware that Australia (where we live) has been having horrific bushfires lately which we are somewhat caught in the middle off. we went travelling to NSW to see family for the holidays and are still stuck here due to fires and insufficient funds to get back. I’m only a casual with full time hours at my job so I don’t get any money until I start back at work which I haven’t been able too cos I’m in a different state. So the property we’re staying at belongs to my great aunties who is kind enough to let us stay with her even after her property and portions of her house have been burnt by the fires. Pluto is a very curious dog when he’s not working or is aloud time to play and muck around and the back of the property we’re staying at is a large shed which was luckily pretty much untouched by the fires that hit a week and a bit ago. So Pluto was playing around the shed this morning when it collapsed on top off him due to the structural integrity failing after the fires it took us 3 hours to find him in the mess his left legs are completely broken and he hasn’t been able to do anything really for the past 6-7 hours I urgently want to get him to some sort of treatment but the nearest vet/hospital but the 70km at the least and it’s only me and my sister here for the next 3 days and me being completely broke and her being an unemployed 15yo isn’t helping much. I’m sorry if none of this makes sense I’m pretty stressed and emotional right now and don’t even know if this makes sense or why I’m doing it but I hope someone can help in some way even just keeping Pluto in your thoughts is all I ask for thanks :)"

basic needs,We need help bad,"So some of you my remember my previous posts about how my finance and i were about to be homeless, well now we are and last night really put things to the test. As we were checking out of the hotel yesterday morning we had to leave roughly half of what we owned behind because we couldn't carry it all and this was mostly clothes. But we were ok with it because we had the essentials because a few weeks back some friends gave us each a fairly decent used coat they had laying around to which we were incredibly grateful. Well last night we got caught in a really horrible rain storm and that pretty much ruined the rest of our stuff inclusing the jacket they gave her because we have no where to wash anything on short notice. We really just need a room for the night to regroup and warm up so that tomorrow I can go to people ready (basically a day labor agency) to start making some money to get us out of this whole. The cheapest one around is the motel 6 at $55.60 a night I know it's asking for a lot but if anyone could help we would so so much appreciate it.

Edit: why do my posts keep getting downvoted? Am I doing something wrong?"

medical,Needing emergency assistance to see doctor on Monday. I was scammed by a “friend” leaving me with $1 to my name. Appointment is for my medications for spinal cord injury and major depression. I have no family and missing this appointment will literally be the end of me.,"Hi everyone. I am embarrassed and ashamed that I have to make this request but my situation is desperate. TL;DR at the end.

I (33F) I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder at 14 years old and have been living with a severe spinal cord injury and degenerative disc disease (C3, C4, C5, C6, C7 vertebrae) since the age of 15. Some days are better than others but none of them are ever without pain, most of them I am completely immobilized. The medicines I need require seeing my doctor quarterly, and if I cannot make my appt at 9am(PST) Monday morning I will have to be hospitalized.

Because of these injuries and illnesses I am unable to work “normal” jobs and have had to make due with odd jobs for friends and acquaintances who understand my physical and mental limitations. This has never been a negative experience until after I met and worked for Cailey(name changed for privacy). 

Cailey is a very successful jeweler and social media “influencer” who I met about a year ago. We quickly became friends and bonded over our struggles with mental illness (she has Borderline Personality Disorder) and our sobriety from alcohol. I am a huge believer in shedding the stigmas around mental health struggles and accepted her with open arms, thinking I understood what BPD was. Within a few months I had stayed with her 24/7 during suicidal episodes, helped her successfully flee a severely abusive relationship, took her to the hospital after she was raped on a tinder date, sat beside her every moment of the exam, rape kit and police questioning, helped her navigate her victims assistance claim, accompanied her to meet with the victims advocate, found and attended support groups with her, and held her while she cried after being diagnosed with an incurable STD, and more. She then offered me a position as her Jewelers Assistant. $20/hr to work and learn the trade, handle correspondence, package items for shipping, and run her social media so she could finish items. She even told me to count the time that I spent walking her dog, doing laundry, and cooking for her (which I never did because we were also friends and I wanted to do those things out of the goodness of my heart and also not rack up more money than she could afford to pay me) This went well for a couple months. It seemed like the perfect situation for the both of us. 

Then she made the conscious decision to “try drinking in moderation” which was extremely unsuccessful for her. I continued to work for her until the end of that month. When I calculated my hours, because she left me to work while she went out to party, it added up to A LOT of money. Knowing that it would overwhelm her I decided to add some extra deductions to what she owed me. I took $250 off towards her power bill, $550 off for half the rent (even though she didn’t ask me to) and submitted my hours to her. As we had done in the past, I told her it’s fine to get it to me in payments. At that point she moved studios and stopped contacting me for work saying she could only afford volunteers. She would send me a couple hundred dollars when I begged her to because I needed to see my doctor or fill my prescriptions. The last time she sent me anything was October 12th. I checked in periodically letting her know I was still waiting for the remainder and she said she’d pay me when she had some money. 

This brings us to a few days ago. She had a sale for her most recent collection and according to the website she’s made in excess of $2500. I waited a day or two to see if she would send me anything and when I realized my appointment was coming up and she wasn’t taking the initiative, I sent her a message asking her to please send me at least $250 of the $438 she still owes. 
Explaining that I need $170 for the appointment and $80 for my scripts. 

Cailey sent me a message back claiming that I lied about my hours (which were meticulous itemized), that she never approved me working that much (which is a bold faced lie, remember that she wanted me to charge her for hours I spent helping with anything, not just jewelery work) and that she wouldn’t be paying me anything more and that she hopes we can end this amicably. She then blocked me on all platforms, including my phone number.

I don’t know what to do. Small claims is an option but that doesn’t help me access my healthcare. And even though I would win in court, she is self employed, so there is nothing to garnish. 

Is anyone out there can help me, I am willing to trade digital art/logo designs, and my eternal gratitude. 

At minimum I need to see the doctor which is $170. The prescriptions are an additional $80 but worst case scenario I can figure that out after the appointment. 

TL;DR I worked for someone who now refuses to finish paying me what they owe me. I was counting on that money to see my specialist for my spinal cord injury and declining mental health. I am disabled and desperate for some kind soul(s) to help me access my healthcare. This is literally life and death."

basic needs,"Rejected for unemployment. No money for meds, rent, bills, food, laundry..... anything,,","Quickest overview I can give: I suffered from an extreme mental health crisis in May 2019, was hospitalized and fired from my job while there because i was unable to inform them why I was gone. I've been job searching for half a year now, with *no luck*, somehow, and am honest to god running out of places I can even apply to in my area. I lived off my savings until November-ish, when I officially ran out..... and at the same time, the new regulations caused me to get cut off from food stamps.

And today, I was officially rejected from receiving unemployment, because apparently psychosis isn't a ""clear"" reason for being unable to work or call in. I literally have $1 to my name right now.

I hate asking for help. I hate it. That's why I waited to the last dollar to ask,,, But getting that official rejection for UI, sitting in the only semi-clean clothes I have, and staring at my calendar reminder to refill my meds..... I need help. And i need it bad,,,

medical,"$35,500 of surgical expenses not covered by insurance + unpaid medical leave","# [https://www.gofundme.com/f/gabis-medical-hiatus](https://www.gofundme.com/f/gabis-medical-hiatus)

# Short version:

All of my weird lifelong symptoms heightened and crashed together over the last three years (following a major death in my life and moving to Atlanta) resulting in medical leave from work starting June 2019 which used to be paid but is now $0 while dealing with appeals (though only 70% if it's approved.)

 I don't anticipate being able to return to work until April or May depending on recovery from removing lipedema. Insurance is not covering the very medically necessary surgeries, totaling **$35,500**. I also have recurring fees for supplements recommended by my doctors (and some out of network doc visits) that legitimately make a difference in my health. (I've tried not taking them for a while to see what happens and my body just starts malfunctioning even more.)

My other conditions include lymphedema, dysautonomia, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hypermobile-EDS), Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), sleep apnea, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. While the last three are mental, they exacerbate the physical disorders. I believe these disorders are in my genetics due to ancestral trauma and my own.

&#x200B;

# Details:

My biggest medical expenses are 3-4\* surgeries for lipedema which are not covered by insurance because the insurance codes for the disorder won't be implemented in the US until at least 2021 but likely 2025.

[About Lipedema - aka Painful Fat Syndrome (Lipedema Project)](https://lipedemaproject.org/about-lipedema/)

**Lipedema is a painful fat disorder that essentially sends lipedema fat (different in cell structure, physical appearance, cause, and behavior than diet/lifestyle or 'normal' fat) through the lymphatic system to the limbs (typically starting with the lower legs going up.) The areas are usually painful to the touch in varying degrees and can become debilitating as it progresses the disease to obesity.**

**Lipedema fat CANNOT be lost through diet or exercise. Lipedema fat strangles the lymphatic, nervous, and circulatory systems. Conservative treatments merely attempt prevent the spread of the disorder and treat symptoms. However, lipedema often spreads regardless of treatment through estrogen-based events such as puberty, pregnancy, and even menopause.**

Waterjet-assisted liposuction is a lymph-sparing procedure specially designed for lipedema. It is NOT a cosmetic procedure. It is done under local anesthesia and is extremely painful.

\* -- I'm delaying the fourth surgery until it becomes painful/necessary, but lipedema can spread in the untreated area\[s\] even faster if other areas have had lipedema removed. The final surgery would be $8,300. I've had doctors in Germany confirm via emailed photos that I definitely have lipedema in this area.)

&#x200B;

# Results of Surgeries (so far):

Since my first surgery alone (lower legs), my physical therapy sessions have improved dramatically. My balance, gait, and overall mobility have become much better than expected. My legs have full feeling now (sometimes more than I'd like -- tables hurt.) **AND my fat no longer hurts to the touch!!!** It used to hurt to be poked or squeezed!! I thought everyone felt this until a rheumatologist explained it was NOT normal. (Guys never understood why my body would hurt so much during.... intimate moments. I just figured they were being too rough.) In contrast, my arms -- which have not been done yet -- internally screamed in pain when I got a tight hug from a friend recently.

I make it very known on private lipedema forums that surgery was one of the best decisions of my life, regardless of the debt.

&#x200B;

# Insurance, wtf?

Most US insurance companies are in class action lawsuits because they keep arguing this is cosmetic, especially due to the lack of insurance codes, yet in spite of pre-cert letters and peer-to-peer discussions with my doctor. (Ironically, Aetna lists the procedure as the main medical way to rid of lipedema on their website... under cosmetic surgery.) I'm doing my best to appeal in the meantime.

However... I can't entirely blame them. Really. The World Health Organization essentially publishes all insurance codes it adds to a system called ICD-##. We are currently on ICD-10 and ICD-11 will come out in 2021. Part of the ICD-11 has been published for preview and includes lipedema (not the surgery though as far as I can find), however until this is fully published, insurance companies cannot use the codes.

Each country has its own department that handles their domestic interpretation of codes. Germany has had lipedema codes available for several years (including lipedema stages, which ICD-11 will lack) as an addition to their own system, but that system cannot be used anywhere but Germany.

The CDC and CMS manage the diagnostic and procedure codes, respectively. The CDC is not expected to fully implement ICD-11 until at least 2025.

&#x200B;

# How am I giving back and how you can help non-monetarily!

* Demographics for lipedema are severely lacking. A small study was run in 2013 in Germany stating the demographics are: 11% of women and two men. Not 2%, two men. No racial breakdowns. No cis/trans breakdowns, which scares me tremendously for MtF transfolx given the disease's reaction to estrogen (and possibly other hormones, we don't know enough yet.)
* I have developed my own survey that will run for the next few months gathering demographics and other medical history to try to establish trends for new researchers to explore without having to deal with university red tape. (I am keeping the data anonymous when publishing results.) I have already gathered 552 responses in one month.
* I plan on using this data to promote not only knowledge of the disorder but knowledge of the medical and research industries' absolute failure to get any reasonable research or promotion of this disease that's been known since Mayo Clinic discovered it 80 years ago. SO many patients (including myself) have come to doctors with nearly anorexic abdomens with disproportionately large and fatty limbs and are told to just lose weight and that it's all our fault. SO many patients are fooled into following diet and exercise trends which can actually harm our lymphatic systems and produce more lipedema. SO many patients on private lipedema forums are suffering from mental abuse from their spouses, friends, family members, coworkers, superiors -- whoever wants to shame them for something that is not their fault. **Ultimately, my goal would be to partner with someone like Jameela Jamil to make sure when someone goes to the doctor with lipedema, it's as easy to spot as someone with psoriasis, and it's treated with actual DIGNITY.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* My lipedema demographics survey is available here: [https://forms.gle/KM3wMJTWLMnoft956](https://forms.gle/KM3wMJTWLMnoft956)
* If you believe you or someone you know has lipedema, please fill this out/share to them. I am particularly interested in the underrepresented groups: WOC (particularly black and hispanic/Latina), men, and transfolx of any gender identity.
* I currently do not need data from people who do not believe they have lipedema.
* There is a privacy statement available on the first page that I take extremely seriously.

&#x200B;

If you can't donate, please share just for the sheer fact that people need to know more about lipedema, EDS, and dysautonomia. These conditions often go together and are often tied to traumatic events in family history or a patient's own life.

pets ,Vet bills for adopting a cat we found abandoned in the highway,"We already have two kitties, not expecting to get another one but me and my wife walked to our local target next to the highway and heard meowing, in the bushes next to the highway we found a very very very skinny low energy cat, looked like it was dying, so we took her in our garage (didn't want to mix with our cats yet) we don't know if she had diseases/fleas, etc. Also she had been declawed so no chance of survival.

In the garage, I  built her a nice warm bed gave her food, water and next day took her to the shelter where they advised us if we want to keep her (which we did because she asked for our help) it was better to take her to a vet.

At the vet they told us she needed a lot of vaccines as soon as she gained a little weight, she was 3 pounds and is 1 year old.

We need to get her spayed as well and of course,e we were not looking to spend this money but of course, we wanted to help her! On Sunday she is allowed to come inside our home with our kitties.

If you want to help us out that would be amazing, in return, I will send you a printed photograph of the cat as soon as she looks healthy and gains some weight.

pets,Please help me pay for my cat's vet visit!,"My cat Thumper has something wrong, we aren't sure what, but she's been limping with her hind legs, and doesn't want to move around a lot. I noticed this yesterday, so we called an made an appointment this morning. We took her to the vet, admittedly not the vet we usually go to, but they didn't have any spots open ay our usual vet, and we didn't want to wait for her to be seen. They did a brief exam, and noticed she has a bit of a fever, but couldn't find any initial reason for her behavior. Here's where it gets expensive, and where the wonderful people of Reddit come in.

Plain and simple, instead of doing the bloodwork and x-ray they wanted to do, we had to settle for just getting her some pain meds and antibiotics because the bloodwork/x-ray combo was going to cost over $600, which we VERY much do not have. The only reason we could even afford to get her meds is because my brother offered to pay for them.

We're already in a tight spot financially, our house is being foreclosed on, and we've been sinking pretty much every dime we have into renovations to be able to sell our house and move to Texas (where my sister and her family live). One of our cars took a shit so we're down to an 18 year old car with transmission issues (that we clearly also cannot afford to fix).

We're both dealing with PTSD, crippling anxiety and depression, and suicidal ideation. Going to therapy, just got on new meds, we're on medicaid and food stamps and in the process of getting on unemployment benefits.

This past May, things because so dangerous, living with my parents, that we packed everything we could into our tiny Chevy Spark and drove halfway across America to escape them. We have no one out here, we had to cut off the absolute entirety of our families to escape safely.

At that point we were helped, given food stamps and medical insurance, and got a therapist through a charity service. We've been seeing her individually since August, and she's made a big difference for us. We just got on medication this Monday- I'm now on blood pressure meds to keep my body from freaking out with my anxiety, he's on a strong anti-psychotic. It's *that* new to us, that his psychiatrist suspects he could have schizophrenia, so he's still very upset about that.... 

I'm physically disabled and cannot work, not to mention the disabling PTSD on top of it all... I just feel so helpless and trapped, and he's doing his best but can't always push past a breakdown. After he got laid off, we called the people we have our car loan through, and they proceeded to chew us all the way out and threaten to take our car, because we were one payment behind already and had a payment plan set up.... They now want $110/week until it's paid up. I don't know what to do... 

We're very frugal people anyway, we live in a 300sqft studio and don't ever go out, I don't know how much more we can tighten our belts. We now live in the Midwest, spitting distance to the Canadian border. It's been consistently in the negatives lately, I've never felt a cold like this. If we lose our car, we lose it all... It's rural up here, no public transportation, no income to afford ubers, no way to get to our therapist or any new work without our car... Please, if you can, please help. We're trying so hard, but still feel so lost...

basic needs,Unfortunate update to: Homeless and surviving the Chicago winter just got harder,"Old Thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/ek2iri/nonmonetary_request_homeless_and_surviving_the/

First let me reiterate how thankful I am. Everything has arrived except for the USB wall chargers and not a day goes by that my life isn't improved by your generosity. I found myself smiling at random points throughout the day, which is very new for a depressive type like me.  

The smiles lasted about a day and a half.  

The following Monday someone from Guardian Asset Management (a HUD contractor) showed up with two cops and it looked like I was going to have to vacate the building then and there. HUD has sent people twice, but they didn't take possession of the house when they found out I was living there. But December 10th, while I was in the hospital, Guardian broke in, changed the locks, screwed the windows shut, stole some of my property and vandalized other property. Not sure why they did that this time, the contractor *may* have exceeded HUD's mandate. Nevertheless the place is legally theirs now, however ill acquired it may have been.

When I got out of the hospital, I was able to gain access (no comment as to how), and we've been just missing each other in terms of when we are at the house. Until Monday when as I said there was a semi dramatic interaction between us and the police. The police seemed inclined to throw me out, but last minute the contractor frustratedly said something like ""OK, look I'll call my boss and tell him someone is still living there, I don't know what'll happen... Maybe ten days, maybe less.."" and gave me a number to call the company, then left. Cops advised I contact a lawyer instead of calling the company myself.  

Not great timing as there is forecasted to be a coldfront coming late next week where lows will be in the 10s for quite a few days in a row. That was already going to be hard to manage with a roof over my head.

That's where things sit now. The week has been insanely busy, and I only make outgoing calls via google voice when I have a spot of wifi access, so I've only made around 8 calls to organizations that may provide legal aid. No luck. I've two more to make, one to a general advice line that's always busy and probably won't lead to representation, and one where I can leave a message at what seems like quite some latency.  

All of your gifts are still just as useful as before. I have a storage unit for the time being where I can store things I'm not carrying. I hope karma returns your generosity tenfold. This time I just need prayers, if you're the praying type. Sorry for the long and maybe disordered post, I don't converse regularly and I may have lost touch with my communication skills."
bills,$440 to cover bills and overdraft,"Reposting after meeting subreddit requirements: 

Would anyone be able to help me out? I am in need of $440 to cover some bills? I moved to a new city and had enough savings but unforeseen circumstances depleted me. I took a job that was commission driven and that is not a strong suit of mine. In two weeks I will be starting a salaried position which offers more financial security. I have rent and other bills covered I however could use $400 for the rest (student loans, car loans, and one of my checking accounts is -250 in the red.) If you are able and willing I would be so grateful. No one foresees a situation where they have to ask for help on reddit so I am making a promise that once I am financially stable again I will come back here and pay it forward :) thanks in advance for your consideration"
basic needs,[Request] UK - Hungry & Exhausted,"Hi
So I don't know how to do this, and I feel terrible asking, but is there anyone who would be able to help me out with some food while I am waiting for the local council to get back to me after an assault on Christmas day.
So, long story shortened because it's a ongoing police investigation, was assaulted on Christmas day twice, leading to injury and now being supported by victim care and the police and council but they said they wouldn't be able to help me with food. I tried leaving the house once since this incident and was followed by the offenders with baseball bats. 
I was already diagnosed with borderline personality disorder & idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and this has certainly pushed me back 10,000 steps behind any progress I worked so hard on. 
I am planning on moving but I am ever more afraid and scared to leave my home, I can't answer the phone or open my curtains and I am so exhausted & miserable now.
I am in need of some food until my next payday which isn't for three weeks, so I would massively appreciate any help if anyone can.

I have an amazon wishlist if that is any help but I am in the UK unfortunately I'm not sure if being out of the UK affects this. I also have paypal too.

basic needs,[REQUEST] Please help end mine and my family's (wife and baby son) homelessness,"My wife, baby son and I are homeless right now and desperately need some help to reunite our family.

Let me explain: we became homeless just after Christmas last year (2019) and are now living in emergency accommodation whilst the council (local authority) decide what to do with us.

The emergency accommodation is just a single room for the three of us to live in.

It can't continue, so we have [this GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-us-reunite-our-family-buzz-bear) set up in order to hopefully allow us to get a place of our own and to also be reunited with our two beautiful cats, Buzz and Bear (you can see a picture of them on our GoFundMe page), who we haven't seen since May 2019 and who have been in foster care since.

Since May 2019 we have been staying with friends and family but they can no longer accommodate us, hence our current predicament.

We are in talks with the council to find us housing, who told us that we could have to stay living in this single room for three years, or perhaps even longer (this is the average for most families) and that they ""probably wouldn't get around to reviewing our case for about one year"".  That would certainly not only destroy our mental health, but more importantly the room simply isn't suitable for our baby to grow up in as he has no personal, safe space that we can let him play in, either.

Please help us to reunite our family and to rebuild our lives.

I'm happy to answer any questions you might have so do message me if you would like to know any more.

Thank you!"

medical,"Seeking Prayers, Shares, Contributions and/or Well-Wishes","Hi Everyone,

For complete transparency, I learned about Reddit while I was starting up a GoFundMe for my third round of IVF (please note I’ve never done a GoFundMe before, and our previous IVF costs were fully paid by ourselves - as it should be). Reddit is a recommended site on GoFundMe for promoting a campaign. So naturally, I joined Reddit when I learned this information.

My husband and I have already tried (and paid for) the process twice. We were blessed with a pregnancy by our single achieved blastocyst. Unfortunately, we had a tragic outcome to that pregnancy at 36 weeks. Our fertility clinic has offered us new protocols to try, so we are looking to begin our next round soon (we have our consultation booked for February 13).

When I joined Reddit, I was hoping to find a place to reach a large number of people, in hopes that we could have more support (whether in the form of financial contributions, prayers, sharing our campaign, or well wishes - all are most welcome). However, in the last couple of weeks I have actually been quite surprised by the communities I have joined on here... of special interest to me are communities related to child loss and IVF. I’ve been fortunate to have some very good interactions with people who can understand my circumstances, and the support from those communities has really helped me see that we are not alone on this journey.

Of course I hope that by sharing this on here it will help our Fertility Campaign grow financially, but I also believe that we can also benefit through the positivity sent our way via well-wishes and prayers. Any support you can provide is much appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my message. If you are able to support in any way, I don’t know how I can thank you - other than to say thank you so very much.

Here is the link to my campaign:

Wisconsin's weather isn't great to begin with but turns out my new (to me) vehicle doesn't like it and it needs to be fixed, which is going to be around 278$ for the parts.

I finally paid off the small amount of debt I had left after selling my old car to a friend for parts, but my credit still isn't good enough (nor do I have the income) to get a loan from my bank. Over half of my monthly income goes towards rent alone.On top of that our building got a new landlord. While I got my rent check in on time, she's still charging me a 25$ late fee for having it in after office hours. (There's a box to drop rent checks into) The last manager of the buildings was polite, understanding, and as long as it was in by midnight the night of the 3rd she counted it as on time.I've asked for help from Leaven too many times and they won't help me anymore. My mom is out of the country until summer and a technophobe so she can't/won't wire me anything, and my dad and his wife are living paycheck to paycheck due to having to care for my drug abusing step-sister's 4 children in their 2 bedroom house.I feel like I've exhausted all of the resources I have and am coming here as a last resort. I'm completely ashamed to put this out here... but it's all I've got. I'm no longer allowed to donate plasma either, which I used to do to get through the months. I have paypal and venmo.

Can I get legal help?I was born with glaucoma and cataracts and had eye surgeries as early as 2-3 months old and I’m still pretty bad. Because of my eyesight I’ve been scared to try learning how to drive, had accommodations in school (bigger pages, magnifying glass on my desk, sitting in the front, separate computer for a bigger screen), been wasting 1.5-3 hours more of my time when using public transportation."
misc,Thank you to everyone on this sub!,"I've been on here the past few weeks and wow, this is just a really wholesome place on the internet. After growing up in a cruel environment and hearing so many horror stories on the news, it's really encouraging to see so many people come together for the common good.

A few people on here have been so great to help me out. Between needing clothes for work, period products, and needing a few things when I move out, people have just really pulled through on here in ways that I never really expected. Not only has their help been with physical items, but with having people to talk to. Having adults that understand my situation (I'm officially emancipated from my abusive parents and am moving out tomorrow!) and being emotionally supporting means everything to me. I know I can talk to my friends about things, but there are some conversations that are better to have with adults if that makes sense. I've really met some fantastic people through this sub and even made some new family members!

I can't thank everyone enough for your kindness. I have all of my absolute necessities right now, and I'm starting to get a real plan on how to manage the next few years of my life. People have sent me budgeting advice, lists of things I didn't even realize I would need I move out, and so many encouraging words. Thank you so much everyone. I love you :)

Also, if you have the time, could you please go through my lists and tell me anything that I will need in the future that I don't have on my lists? I would appreciate it so much! Some things are more expensive than they will be at other stores, but it's mostly so I know what colors and styles of things I like. It's also to give me a general idea of what I should be paying for certain things and how much I should save for my future :)

bills,Podcast Bills are Due,"One of the things that have kept me sane and feeling like I've been worth something has been podcasting. I have two podcasts but one of them has larger bills than the other and those bills are due in a couple of days so I need $300 to keep that up and running.

We All Have an X-Chromosome has been working since February to do what we can to be a voice for intersectional feminism. Being intersectional also means we have to tell stories and share information for not only feminist issues but any type of issue regarding LGBTQA+, race, financial inequity, etc.

The startup of this podcast came completely out of pocket due to a well-timed tax return, but bills are due. The first thing is the website. Due to our needs for the podcast, our hosting bill is due on January 13th. That is $300.00. This pays for the full year and all of the various business aspects we need and use for the website.

Look, we don't have sponsors banging on our doors. If we did, we'd be very particular on what we would bring onto the show because we don't want our editorial process hindered because a sponsor doesn't want something. We have a loyal set of listeners and the better we are funded the more we can do. Our podcast family has gone through trials and tribulations that have caused personal financial strain. Yet this is something that we do because we feel it is a benefit for society and hope our friends and allies agree with that.

The $300 is the immediate need, but anything beyond that will go for the next set of bills we have to pay (which hopefully there would be my tax return so I don't have to do much about it).

I'm at my friends house, officially away from my parents FOREVER and have all of my necessities here already. The only thing I need is some food to get me through my first paycheck. Our agreement was that I pay rent and for my food when I move in. I was able to pay my part of rent already, but that's made me super super short on groceries. I'll have $11 to last me until the 31st, which isn't really going to work out. If possible, I'd really love an Amazon card so I can get some food delivered today (I can send pics of the order and the groceries when they arrive!) I also have bulk stuff on my wishlist that can last me a few weeks to a few month as a Dominos giftcard since it's right across the street and pizza would be great tonight, but I know that's totally not a necessity. Thanks to anyone who can help! I'm really hoping that once my first few paychecks come through and I get more settled I can start giving back on here :D

I am a 17 M from Indonesia, My family and I havent been doing well these past few years. We struggle just to pay basic necessities, like electricity and me and my brothers school fees.

Ever since my dad's works went downhill a couple of years ago, my parents borrowed a lot of money from their friends and relatives and applying mortgages just to pay basic necessities.


And now these few years people are insisting my parents to pay up the debt. My parents are stressed out, because we are barely keeping foods on the table and now people are pushing us to pay the debts.


In February/March I will have to undergo a surgery to remove the metal that connects the bones in my ankle. Because last year I had a surgery to remove a bone tumor in my leg. Even though the surgery itself is free (because of government program here), I still have to pay for the rooms and medicine ,which last year my parents had to borrow some money again to pay for it.

loan,T-Tbones by Police Officer (Officer at fault). I had to fix my car on my dime until I’m able to file a lawsuit and win. I need this car to get to doctors appointments.,"
On Oct. 21 I and one other driver were Tboned by a Denver Police Officer. We had a green light when all of a sudden the officer hit the car next to me, the car next to me was then slammed into me. Our cars were span about 45 degrees  the police car ended up on the opposite side of the intersection. 

  The driver next to me wasn’t injured I however wasn’t so lucky. My medical history is very extensive I have some extremely rare medical conditions one that causes tumors to grow on my nerves and other organs called Neurofibromatosis. Another that is a rare spinal defect called Tethered Cord Syndrome. The tumors have invaded my spinal cord I can prove this to anyone that wants the back up. I can also prove the tethered cord. In 2018 I had to undergo radiation therapy in a last ditch effort to avoid an extensive surgery that would involve removing vertebrae, and the muscle around my spine to get the tumors out because they are growing in the spinal canal. As you can imagine the tumors in them self are very, very painful. The radiation did not stop the growth of the tumors, it in fact made them grow even more now I’m looking at being forced into surgery because the pain from the tumors has changed causing the pain to shoot into my groin and legs. Since the accident my hip and spine have been in a lot more pain we were hit at no less then 30 (or right about) miles an hour. 


Because it was a Police Officer that hit us I am having to go through a lengthy legal battle to even have my medical bills payed by the city of Denver. The car repairs came to 2,738.00.  As you can imagine by the medical issues I face on a daily basis it requires a lot of doctor appointments and I can’t rely on the bus because a lot of times the appointments come up last minute like the one I had with urology last week which I found out about less then a day in advance.  I also need the car to get to my part time job and back living in Denver is very expensive and I don’t have family, or friends that live close that I can rely on for a ride.   If you can find any extra little bit of money to help me fix the car I will find a way to pay it forward in the future.   If  you would like any proof of the things I have said don’t hesitate to ask I’ll happily 
send it. 

Edit I only had liability at the time of the crash before this car I drove junk to make things worse it was the car growing up I always told myself I would get one day.  I got it in mid June.  The insurance is my fault I’ll own up to that but the health issues didn’t help cloud my thinking I was distracted by those and didn’t think about going over my policy. 

After finding out my tumors had not stopped growing and the radiation hadn’t helped having a car to get out and drive somewhere to be alone and think gave me a a way to not let all of the negative energy build inside. Driving somewhere scenic was a move way to just decompress. 
Asking for this help is hard I feel bad having to ask but this coupled with my medical issues is just too much for me.

basic needs,Friend of mine had to unexpectedly move out. Lost her josb due to injuries from a prior one and needs assistance.,"[Link to the gofundme.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/single-mom-whose-life-took-unexpected-turn?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-3)

The gofundme link lists everything that had happened to her for the past few months, but to paraphrase what happened, my friend needs financial assistance for this month so she can find a full time job. She used to work as an assistant for a class that had special needs kids, and one of those kids attacked her one day, fracturing her legs.

Since then, she has had other jobs, but due to her legs swelling up, she was let go from her other jobs. Her son has special needs and can not attend classes for more than 3 hours, until his IEP is setup in 4 weeks, meaning that until then she can not work full time as she will be attending to her son after those 3 hours.

She is getting documents setup to work for Lyft and uber, as all the other jobs she applied for have not gotten back to herz nor has her applications for government assistance. So even small donations for gas money will go a long way.

Again, her gofundme is more detailed on what she went through and why she needs the assistance, so if you do have the time please read it! Thank you for taking the time to read my post, and I hope you all have a great day/night!"

bills,Trying to Leave Toxic Living Situation - Need to Have Deposit and 1st Month's Rent Up Front (by the 24th) - $850,"Have been maintaining myself and my mother since I was 22. At the time she worked part time as a cashier. Those funds paid groceries and went to grandma while I paid for EVERYTHING else. She was fired from her part time job for repeatedly showing up late. This was 3.5 years ago. Since then she has not looked for new work or filed unemployment. At the time I gave my mother access to my cards and account so she could pay my bills and buy groceries while I worked in the AMs and went to school in the PMs since she was home all day. To this day she still has my cards and access to my online banking accounts.  She also sent what little money I had in my savings to my grandmother to help her out.

I opened a hidden account where I work and had been saving up for almost a year so that I could get away/ move when my lease is up, but I had to have emergency back surgery in September, and had to use that money I'd saved for copays, an xray, an MRI, medicine, and paying some bills while I was out of work recovering. Some of my bills ended up going late which further compounded my financial issues with late fees and interests. Both my mother and my medical costs have ruined my credit so I cannot get a loan.

I was able to save up enough to cover the app fee and the deposit on the new apt so they could hold it for me, but they require the ($160) pet deposit AND 1st month's rent ($690) before they can give me the keys on the 24th and I won't be able to come up with it because I have only $54 left in my bank account. I am absolutely beyond desperate and have no one I can ask for help. The only friend I have is a coworker who can only help me by moving some of my stuff in her car. My family are all on my mother's side and they basically think I am a piece of shit for ""throwing my mom out on the street"" but no one questions why she has not worked or studied a single day in 3.5 years.

I can provide proof of EVERYTHING... my medical costs, the fact that I work full time plus whatever overtime I can, the new apt costs, and what I have already paid for. EVERYTHING. I really just need someone to help me get the hell away from my mother so I can try to piece my life back together. Thanks to her I am in debt, my cards are maxed, and I lost the support system I had in friends and family. I now suffer from clinical depression and PTSD, and am basically falling apart financially, mentally, emotionally, and even physically.

The new place I need to get into is smaller and $150 cheaper that where I am now. It's close to my current job so I can walk/take the bus ( I don't have a car.) And is owned by the same company that owns where I am right now so even though my credit is bad they approved me because I've always paid them well. They just want me to pay on January 24th (my move in date) instead of on February 1st.

I know the total I need is steep, and I don't quite know how this kind of help works here but I am willing to accept ANY amount that anyone is willing to help me with towards that total, and again, I can provide proofs.

misc,Airfare to pay respects to my Amazing Gran,"Hi, I'm not sure how to format this so here goes:

My gran walked in to the hospital a few weeks ago with a pain in her stomach, two weeks later she had surgery for pancreatic cancer.  They got it all, they said, without needing to cut away her stomach or other areas.  She recovered nicely for a few days in hospital so they sent her home to stay with her niece.  In the night, she developed massive bloodclots in both of her lungs.  She died on Christmas Morning from a double pulmonary embolism.

I had had a bad dream the night before she died and posted it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/efkt0e/angie_u_fkin_hick/).  The last time that I saw her was three years ago at my brother's wedding. We took [goofy photos together.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/emvxmp/me_with_my_role_model_from_brothers_wedding_photo/)

We always met near oceans somehow and would hold hands and dip our toes in, even during a hurricane.  She took an interest in me, even though she was my grandfather's second wife and so no real obligation to love me, you know?  She loved me though, and she made a point to be a fantastic role model for me.  Before there was Marie Kondo, there was my GrAnn who used to always ask me:  ""Do you love it?  If you don't just absolutely love it, don't bring it home. "" \*She was referring to clothes shopping, but that advice is true on so many levels.

I have never asked for help online before but the swiftness of her passing, she had a diagnosis, a surgery and passed away all in the span of less than two months.... combined with my own issues this year:  I had a stroke in May and a pulmonary embolism in October as well as a diagnosis of Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APLS) which basically means my blood is too thick and can be fatal.....  I just don't have any options other than asking for help.

Currently  I do not have any cash or assets to sell in order to make it to her 'celebration of life' memorial across the country in two weeks time.  I really would love to go so I thought I would try to ask here and see if there would be any kind souls willing to basically pay  my way home to Texas (Houston) and back.  I would also need some assistance for a hotel room for a night.  I sure hope this finds the right person.

I have paypal and I have bitcoin or other crypto payment addresses I am not sure how this works if I post my info on to the post or if I use direct messages?

Well, thanks for reading.  I just got out of hospital yesterday, my guts had literally got all twisted from continuous weeping and crying which resulted in something called cyclical vomiting syndrome.  When I think that I will miss this memorial service (It's an annual Chinese New Year party she threw every year) I start to well up inside so I am posting here and hoping for help.

My GrAnn was not religious she was someone who followed her heart and believed in the power of love.  We both loved the same things, red hearts, elephants, sparkles, bright colors.  I felt like her daughter and I think she felt the motherly tenderness for me too.  Every year she threw a Chinese New Year party, so her family decide to continue her tradition and have a memorial celebration of life.  I want to go.  I would mean a lot to me

&#x200B;

What I want to do is to give her a letter.  When my grandfather died I wrote down all the things I had ever wanted to say to him (he was quite stoic, a business man and engineer )  Since he was in the military, he was presented with a folded flag at his funeral which my gran took with her.  I had slipped the letter into the flag unknowingly thinking it would be buried with him.  She must have read that letter and I would like to deliver a eulogy or letter or some sort of tribute to her as well.  It is really important to me and I do not know where to turn to for help so I thought I would try here.  I had made a point to tell her in writing how I felt but I still have some things left unsaid.

Please message me if you would like to help via paypal or crypto

I would be more than happy to send an original piece of artwork to any kind-hearted assisting souls who would like one.  It would be an honor to thank you in this way.

bills,AT&T keeps fucking me and I need help getting out,"So AT&T said they would move my payment cycle to the 27 of every month because that’s the day the paycheck comes in. I talked to two support people and both said it would be done. Now it hasn’t happened and they keep charging extra money for a bill that was payed off months ago. In November they shut off my internet because, get this, I payed ahead and instead of applying it a month ahead they just lowered my monthly payments. After discussing this with them they said it was all resolved. Then double charged me for 235 in December. Once I payed off the late payment I then payed off my next months payment, so the one for January, and they are now shutting off my internet again and are now asking for 217 and I just can’t. Me and my wife make just enough to pay all our bills and have some leftover to save and this has been bleeding us dry. I had heard ATT was the worst company but this is just unreal. I have pictures that can prove everything above if it’s needed. But I can’t do this now. We have 17 left till payday and it’s not going well."
misc,Need help coming up with about $400,"
Trying to stay positive and also to not feel so bad that I do need help and knowing with help of a kind person’s words that it is ok to be in a bad spot, and it’s ok regardless of what others say to be down on my luck needing a leg up and to ask for help. ( thank you to that person, I was very much listening) so after some time thinking I have now posted this, things have not gotten better and I am trying to hold hope. Seems like things are a like a snowball, get one bad time that just rolls bigger. And regardless of the tolls or scammers I will keep trying everything I can including writing this post.

To the point, I been in a bad spot for awhile now , having a hard time getting work and have lived off of my credit which is totally shot now from me and helping my grandmother and uncle and family as both died in 2018. I have done some odds and ends and sold all I can leaving only a couple things on eBay one of which is my grandfather’s antique flag which seems my price is too much and hard to find buyers I need to come up with a little over $400 for  for the winter, and other immediate things,  and I have a Gofundme on another sub for a less  immediate thing at the moment.I can not get a loan as well I’m being sued from just about all my credit cards, I can’t use the borrow sub here as who wants to lend money to someone without the promise of repayment. My family is limited and have nothing to help. I have been doing surveys and signup for pays but that’s not cutting it however does help with small things. I was unable to get unemployment, disability gave me a run around for my issues. So lol I’m just up the Creek and really need a paddle. I have no friends no social media and have posted my gofundme on a sub here but that has gone no where.  

I try, but know it is not very hopeful to get anywhere.( but trying to stay positive ) If you want to sit here and tell me to get a job...I’m trying, if you want to belittle me for being out of work so long then please just move on, I really have had enough of comments telling me I’m wrong for being in a bad spot, really don’t need it.

pets,Please help me pay veterinary expenses for an injured dove,"Past monday, a relative who knows Im a vet student brought home a severly injured dove he found on the street. Someone shot the poor bird right in the inner part of the wing, and it was bleeding a lot. I tried to do my best with few materials I had at home (since I don't live there anymore, it's my family home and I'm studying in another city). Dove has been eating, drinking and pooping well, however I couldn't prevent the infection and condition is now very poor. We've been to the vet a couple of times now and the dove is under several antibiotic and anti-ifflamatory treatments, and will most likely need a surgery to remove its wing. I'm paying everything because I know there's hope for this little bird, but I'm just a student and any help would be amazing.
For most people a dove is just that, a simple, unimportant animal that doesn't deserve this much attention, but I just couldn't leave It like that, already knowing I could do something. It deserves to live, too. 

Soon I will post pics of the bird, receipts and medicines, as well as an amazon wishlist of things I'll need to take care of it, in case someone prefers that over simple money.

So if you can [throw a few bucks to Waggytail](https://www.waggytailrescue.org/donate) to help Will & his friends, that would be amazing.

And if you don’t have cash to throw at Waggytail, think about throwing some positive vibes or prayers his way tomorrow. Like he & his current vet are both champs and don’t *need* vibes and prayers, but it can only help, right?"

I just moved into a room for rent, and I have no other forms of income if I lose this job. 

Would somebody please be able to order me an Uber Gift Card or be able to send funds for a 2 week bus pass please? I'm very scared of the possibility of missing work tomorrow and losing my job. Currently living in Raleigh, NC.


Thank you for reading.


Edit: Cost of an Uber to and from Work would be $27.85, but honestly a $25 card would suffice and I'll walk the rest of the way home. And a $25 bus pass would last me about a week or 2, but I dont know if you're able to purchase bus passes online for GoRaleigh Bus Station. Again thank you for reading."

misc,Electrical advice,"I am not looking for an electrician to come out, just an opinion and I’d really appreciate it. So yesterday, my light in my bathroom just died. It was the light fixture itself, not the light bulb. Well, today the microwave died. It was still hot even after I unplugged it although it had run maybe 10 mins before. So, the kitchen is adjacent to the bathroom and they’re on the same breaker. I’m concerned because the house is old by at least 80 years and I really really don’t want to lose my family, home and pets to an electrical fire. Can’t afford for anyone to come in as of yet and need to buy a fire extinguisher. Could anyone advise me if there’s any risk and if so, how can I reduce the chances of it happening? thank you, I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit."

Anyone who's had one before, do you know what it could be?","The ligament tear is a sporting injury, rendered me unable to walk for a month. The verdict from the doctor said it would be 3 months before i can play again, but i waited for 4 just to be sure, since i might (very small chance) have a career as an athlete.

I tried playing this past week, and the pain was small initially but quickly worsened each day. It's not unbearable, and it doesnt feel too serious, but today the swelling grew substantially, and it's making me anxious.

If anyone has any experience with ligament tears, it would be much appreciated if you could tell me if this is normal or not.

(Note: ligament tears do not show up on X-rays and i don't want to go for an MRI unless i absolutely have to, due to financial reasons(it's really bad rn). This is my first ligament tear I've ever had, so forgive me if I've said something stupid)"

misc,Looking for a poundland engagement ring for my man,"I decided recently that I want to propose to my boyfriend of 4 years. I remembered that this year is a leap year and is one of those times where a woman is “allowed” to propose- I’m also a very liberal woman and think why the hell shouldn’t I be the one to ask?!?!  I was the one who asked him out first, I said I love you first, I asked him to move in— so, it only makes sense that I propose to him. We love each other dearly. Also, I read that Finnish people believe if a woman asks on feb 29, it is good luck. 

Anyway, I recently saw an article of the UK poundland store selling “standby” rings. I love this because I really have no clue what ring to get, do I get him a ring? Can we just go through that process together? 

Also he says “standby” anytime he’s in the middle of something or about to go underground for the subway and won’t get reception, or focused on something and I’m trying to interrupt him lol 

So PLEASE! I’m asking for your help - could someone please mail me a poundland ring to Canada!! I will reimburse for your troubles. I think he is a size 9 ring.  

Much appreciated



Our back story:
We have known each other for over 20 years. We were always friends but he was in a serious relationship that turned in to marriage that turned into divorce. I was in several long term relationships, one was his friend back in high school. We finally were both single at the same time and I always knew he was the perfect guy.  I finally got a chance and I didn’t want to lose it- we saw each other basically every day since our first real date. We can chat for hours and enjoy lots of things together and apart. We support and encourage one another. We also keep each other in check. It’s great finding your equal but I still thinks he’s the smartest, sexiest, greatest catch of a man!!

bills,I need help with a bill and a hand brace,"I need help, I don't like asking for help because well I'm kinda a pain like that. But I've no options left besides asking Dad to help and that's not something I want to do. (He'd create drama about it because it's him) I've been out of work for about a month now, due to medical leave so I've not been able to make any money to pay my phone bill, and now I need a new brace due to why I was out of work on a leave of absence (same as medical leave) I was diagnosed Tuesday with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome so I need a brace that fits correctly so I can go back to work but that is my lesser concern. (I can use the brace I have until I can get paid to get a new one) but what I'm most concerned about is the phone bill. Because that is my biggest concern and where I need help the most.

Normally I would not care that my phones turned off because wifi works the primary parts of my phone but I need my phone this month due to needing to be able to take calls due to medical appointments. I have been approved for the medical surgery I need but I am waiting for the call to set up the final appointments to get said appointment and now that I have to see a physical hand therapist bi-weekly I need to be able to take their calls if she has to reschedule or I need to because of my other therapy or appointments. And again I cannot ask dad to help because that's already been an issue as of late and I was hoping to be back to work by now but trying to work with my caseworker for my leave of absence has been hard. She likes to communicate through phone calls, and I prefer email. But I still have to get to my primary doctor to fill out the papers to come back to work, and theirs a chance I will be laid off after I get back. (its a seasonal gig so not sure they will treat my absence due to medical etc) so I really need help.

I need help paying my phone bill first and foremost, I can make my brace work until I can pay for it myself. the phone bill is $40 dollars and I'm more than happy to send a screenshot showing this (Its metropcs, its the cheapest plan I can use because I can't always get to wifi so its easiest to use the unlimited data part) normally I'd have no issue with this but sadly as of late again I've had a problem. It's due today which is a problem as well and I cannot do much about it, I was truly hoping to be back to work much sooner than this so I could pay it myself. And I'd be more than happy to pay the money back as well or to pass it to someone else who needs help as well. I would use the borrow subreddit but I cannot give an estimate of when I'd be able to pay it back. But I'd be happy to or pay it forward as soon as I get a check again. 

I use paypal as my transfer stuff because its the simplest form I have. Please if you can help me that would be amazing and again I'd be happy to pay it back but I just do not know when exactly I'd be able to. I hope to be back to work next week or the week after at the latest And then I can pay it back and get my brace. so please if anyone is able to help with the $40 I'd be so grateful and it would mean so much to me as well.

Thank you so very much"

Good afternoon Reddit.

I've posted here before, and I feel horrible asking again especially so soon. But here's my story.So I'm waiting on Disability to be confirmed, until then I absolutely need to make every penny count. I have Epilepsy and am unable to drive. Luckily, there is a soup kitchen on the other side of town, I've got pretty used to the walk. Heres where the problem starts: We have some significant winter weather coming over the next few days - and even if I could trudge through it, the kitchen is likely to be closed...and I'm plum out of some basic staples, and cash.

I'm a great budget cook (learned from necessity), honestly even just $3 would make me enough lentil curry to last the weekend. I really would like not to starve during this cold weekend. I use PayPal as my bank, and can give you my email. Either way thanks for reading, I hope everyone has a wonderful day."

Before my mental illnesses became severe I had a nice career and was close to finishing college on my own, but it seems like I've had to learn how to be independent all over again after losing everything due to my mental illnesses, I used to be assisting people not asking for assistance so it's been hard for me to get the courage to have to ask anyone for such a favor like this. Luckily a nice redditor had helped me with food until I get my first paycheck in a week and a half, but I've been having issues with transportation to and from work as almost every other day I dont have enough $ for the bus.  I've been looking online and have found a nice bicycle for $65 on Facebook marketplace. I didn't know if anyone could possibly help me financially with obtaining it. Or if it was possible for someone to buy me a 30 day bus pass online that would be great as well. I just need reliable transportation so I dont lose my job.  Currently live in Raleigh, NC. I can provide any information you'd like for proof or if you have any questions about me I'd be happy to share.

My fatigue and exhaustion is outof control so its possiblei missed a rule or misunderstood it! I will fix right away if one is poiunted out to me. Thank you in advance. end of August i had emergency appendix surgery plus a severe allergic reaction to what we later found out was the orange pre op prep disinfectant. My pain never went away and it got so much worse. I was going to the bathroom upwards of 20 times a day. Didnt return to work. End of september i had a fully under anesthia colonscopy with biopsies. Nothing was found. I fought for a hida bc i knew it was my gallbladder. Sure enough it was. October 24th i had my gallbladder removed plus another allergic reaction to the preop! They found it was chronic cholecystitis plus benign tumors. Im a 24 female not overweight. Id been suffering for 9 to 10 years. I finally returned to work part time beginning of December for 2 weeks. Full time since then and im barely surviving. Had insomnia since surgery #1. My joints started to swell big time after this last surgery and ive lost 30 lbs.  My insulin resistance is bad bc i wasnt able to take my medicine due to not eating alot. My thyroid has developed 2 nodules that are being tested(i had hashimotos before anyways). It was going to be saturday but we are getting bad weather saturday so i have to postpone it again :(  My gyn had to take me off my birth control for a few months(i have bad pcos!) Because i wanted a new birth control as my old one probably added to my gallbladder issues. All this is new since surgery. i can no longer wear watches or jewerly because i develop rashes. I had to cut 9 inches off my hair because it hurts to wash it. I have (seemongly) permanent severe pain where my gallbladder was removed from in the front and the back. I have to sleep on an electric blanket just so i can move on the mornings and sometimes i stuff pillows behind my back and semi under me for supporrt. The nights i dont sleep with heat my mom literally has to apply heat to me for hours to help un stiffen my joints. My left wrist is basically gone with pain. I sleep with 2 wrist braces on, 1 on each hand. I have to wear an abdomen binder (i have 3 options depending on the level of pain that day), i have gloves and compression for my hands and fingers, i have compression for my elbows, braces for my knees, and compression for my ankles. I sob in pain and today i i couldn't make it to work because of my pain. I can't do things like consistantly chop vegetables anymore because im not strong enough to push down sometimes or the pain gets too bad. Im using pickup for things like a 24 pk case of water so i dont have to load it in cart and unload it etc. I feel like my life ended overnight in many ways. I hope this makes sense. Im so exhausted most nights i can choose to shower or eat a small meal but never both. The pain is just indescribable and im terrified. Im only 24. We are trying to figure out what is causing this all. 

Could be a severe nutrient deficiency but also we are inclined to believe that im severely allergic to the metal clips in my body that they used for both appendix (also used and left metal staples in me) and then my gallbladder. So thats a whole mess that im trying to figure out without much help from drs, except for  dr who isnt covered by insurance

Im asking for the items on my lists because ontop of not working for 3.5 months, i am now having to meet my deductible again for insurance and ill do that before end of February at this rate. We have had multiple home emergencies that consumed multiple months paychecks right before and right after my first surgery. Last month mg car needed maintenance i had already pushed off for 6 months, a new battery (not related to maintence that was pushed off), and all 4 of my tires were bare. That alone consumed 1500 to 1700 dollars. All my credit cards are maxed out and i cant afford the items on my list(esp list 1, bc i tske care of my kitties and mom first). 

The items on this list #1 are things that are meant for people with arthris/bad joint pain(my mom also has SEVERE arthritis), things to allow me to get food/nutrition with minimal work, allow me to clean without having to stay in bed the next day, compression for my hands and fingers, tools that are meant to be easier for people with joint pain to use so i can take care of my home.
 
List 1: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2JTR8V54O38Y0?ref_=wl_share


The items on list #2  are for my furbabies. 

List 2:  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/VR2M05IPRAT6?ref_=wl_share

We adopted 2 kittens end of December because #1 my older cat has extreme separation anxiety from me and panicked when I was overnight in the hospital. #2 he has the energy of a wild cat and needs a play mate #3 he gets SO lonely its heart breaking. He watches us leave in the front window #4 i will always put my kitties needs before my own and they are so so spoiled.  Always. #5 before my surgeries i worked a 2nd job where i made an extea $200 to $400 a month. Since the new yeat my pain had increased tenfold snd where i had hope of returning to that job in December, these new developments are preventing that .

I have enough cat litter for a year or so because i managed to coupon so well i got each box for $4 vs the $15 it normally is so im covered litter wise. 

Mom and i didnt want to let my cancer scares(negative for breast cancer thankfully) hold us from doing things we had planned on it. especially since i will most likely have to have another surgery or two to remove the clips and then another 1 or two for exploratory reasons. :( 

Thank you for reading this. Im so sorry again if it doesnt make sense.  And im so sorry at how long it is. I hope i followed the rules. Thank you.

Edit: pics of cats for fun. All 3 are special needs. I can submit proof o dr bills. My paycheck statments showing how much it is vs my monthly bills etc if needed! Yall are bringing me yo tears with your generosity. I wasnt evem done adding stuff before you all started helping. My mom and i are shocked. We never have had support like this. Its always just been us. And i just.. thank you all. Thank you so so much. 


2nd edit: to further clarify the dr not covered by insurance agrees something is 100% wrong with me and is willing to run the needed tests. One of the tests i need will cost anywhere between $500 to $800 and its to test for metal allergies. Yes. Its alot. Yes. Its needed. No insurance wont cover it :(  my mom has severe arthritis, fibromyalgia, no cartilage left in hands or neck, and she is looking at a cataract surgery and potentional knee surgery and to see if the dr can do surgery on her hand. Her feet have hsd 3 foot surgeries on 1 foot and 4 on another and all failed so she id obviously hesitant. I am truly the ""healthier"" one of us and the only one capable of doing any ""heavy"" lifting etc. Of course im not going to tell my mom no if she drops something on floor. It hurts me a ton to get down there. But it would kill her to get down there."

His mother is his full time care taker and can't work as he cannot be left unattended for any amount of time.

Anyways, I have $30 towards a room. The cheapest room around here is $47 plus tax, est $4. It's supposed to rain for the next 2 days. I could really use some help getting the rest to stay at least one day. Two days would be awesome but I don't expect that. So I really need $21 to get a room for 1 day. If anyone or a few people could help for 2 days, it would be great but I don't expect that. It would be $72 to get 2 days. If your still reading this, thank you.

bills,"Abusive family, now facing eviction. Need any help you can offer.","I have an abusive mother and an alcoholic father. I was living with them briefly, (early 20s) while desperately searching for a new job and a new place to live. 

I found both and I was ecstatic. I love the place and I did like my job. On the downside, my boss made flirty gestures toward me and management was chaotic. However, it paid well so I thought it may be temporary while searching for a better place to grow my career. 

I got fired for being 2 hours late due to an emergency. At first, my boss was okay with it but his boss was in the office that day and immediately shut me down. I begged and pleaded but she had decided I was done. 

I haven’t saved up much money because I spent so much getting a new car (used, bought outright) after my last one gave out. I only have some pocket change for gas and groceries. 

I live in a hire at will state and I do not qualify for unemployment. I have rent coming up next month ($775) and a phone bill ($100) 

Any help would be beyond appreciated. I am currently interviewing for immediately hiring temp jobs just so I can pay the bills quickly. 

I don’t have many skills for jobs I can do over the internet in exchange for assistance but I am a decent writer I just can’t find freelance work quite yet but if you happened to need that...I would be glad. I’m also well versed in sales and if you need prospecting or even a marketing consult for a small business I can do that too. Again, I have looked for freelance marketing work and haven’t found anything yet.

bills,Looking for assistance in clearing large bank fees,"
Over the past month, I’ve accumulated over $300 worth of NSF fees due to automatic/recurring payments. I reached out to Bank of America in hopes of getting some of the fees waived, but the representative I spoke with basically told me there was nothing that could be done.

I’m currently a college student, and starting my spring semester next week. I don’t receive any financial assistance, and will have to pay for my own books/tuition out of my own pocket, on top of these fees and other financial priorities. 

I understand there’s some accountability to be taken on my part for letting the fees accumulate and not taking necessary action sooner. All I’m asking is for a little assistance in helping get back on my feet. Even a little bit helps tremendously. Thanks. PM me if you’d be interesting in helping somehow.

misc,I just need a little pick me up. Please tell me something happy. It's my birthday and it's the worst one yet.,"My life has been in shambles the last month or so. I'm currently 13 almost 14 weeks pregnant, and while it is a miracle baby and I am so thankful and so happy, I hate this pregnancy.

My morning sickness decided to get worse at 12 weeks not better and now I pretty much throw up non stop if I'm not laying down or sitting in bed.

I've ended up in the hospital twice in the last month due to the flu, and I'm still getting over it a bit.

2 months ago I cut off the last of my family, and I have no friends. I have really bad social anxiety and it seems every time I find a friend, they just use me so I didn't see a point anymore.

Well today is my 22nd birthday. I never thought I would make it this far. I had planned, since 13, to kill myself while 21.

My husband works late today so I am just stuck alone, friggin sad, not able to physically do anything.

I could really use something happy to think about. A happy story, a good joke. Please."
misc,Birthday Help,"My husband and I just celebrated our ten year anniversary and his first anniversary serving in the United States Air Force. 

We just moved to our first location. Our town is very small and I am struggling finding work while being in school. I decided to take this term off and focus on finding work without any distractions. So far, I have applied at a dozen or so different places and haven't heard back yet. I do keep checking up and hopefully some good will happen soon! I have never been without a job for this long and I've been battling depression along with the financial stress that comes with unemployment. To add to this, our base is also very small and I am working with hiring staff as well. 

My husbands birthday (29th) is coming up in a few weeks and he has been so stressed since starting this new career.

Throughout the last few months he has been mentioning that he wants another keyboard someday...

When we first met over ten years ago, he would play music for me. He is so extremely talented and would often compose his own music on his keyboard. He would play for hours and fill the house with the most amazing harmonies. It brings tears to my eyes just remembering it. 

He had a nice grand yamaha keyboard that broke a year or so after we met. Over the years I tried to get it fixed for him at two different repair shops and they both confirmed that it was unfixable and he decided to donate it for parts.

I would love to get him a new keyboard for his birthday, much like the one he originally had. I know that's hard to ask, and I wouldn't be asking, but know how much a new keyboard would mean to him.

I would never normally consider using his military status to gain anything at all. But this to him would mean the entire world. Music for him is an outlet, it's his therapy, his happy place and know he needs this outlet right now. 

I've saved the monetary gifts that I received from my parents for Christmas, which isn't a lot. Our family's are not in a financial position to help.

This is a total shot in the dark for me and something way outside my comfort zone. I'm doing this for him, for his sanity and his happiness. If there is anyone willing to help me do this for him I would be so extremely thankful and beyond grateful. 

If you read this I want to thank you for taking the time to hear our story.

Edit: more financial information

Upon completing technical training (tech School) he was delayed three weeks because he received his orders late. 

He was supposed to be allowed RAP where he gets to stay in his home town while assisting the recruiters office. But, because his orders were late he missed this opportunity and didn't get to spend time with friends and family before moving.

Because of the delay of information, he had no choice but to use his entire leave (PTO) and had to cash in his retirement in order for us to afford to move to our new location.

While we do receive basic housing allowance, it's not that much. Our rent is on the higher side because it's the only housing we could find when we got here. We are absolutely planning on moving somewhere cheaper when our lease is up. 

So for those who don't understand why I'm asking, hopefully this information helps. It's not as great as people think. Pay wise, he was making more money working at a Mill back home. 

We have had a very rough year. Please be kind."

Now my insurance is telling me it is a possible total loss. I don't know what to do.

How do I bring this up to my parents?
Can I convince the insurance to pay best they could and I pay the rest to fix the car or is it over the moment they declare ""total loss""?
How much do they usually pay for scrapping the car? Visually nothing is wrong but the front driver side bumper. Maybe something under it is wrong? 
I don't know. It's 2 am and I'll call them about it tomorrow but I can't sleep... I just need reassurance things will be ok.."
basic needs,Could anyone help with food?,"Hello ♡ 

Local Arizona/USA lady here who could a helping hand. I'm not proud to be posting this but I have to admit I've run out of options.  My account is overdrawn by -$324. I managed to buy a box of ramen with change but I am going to run out before I got paid in 2 weeks. I have a handful of pennies atm. 

If I am being straight honest, I'm this situation because I had a mental break down and wasn't able to work. It's a long story but I come from a small family of addicts that are abusive. My sister had my niece last year and I agreed to be a part of the family again if she stayed clean. Right before Christmas she decided to abandon her baby to go on a 3 day heroine binge. After involving CPS I said goodbye to my entire family forever and then promptly broke down into my first anxiety induced psychosis. I wasn't able to take care of myself properly but I am now. I am on medication and am working with a wonderful therapist. I just returned to work part time. 

I don't know if it's possible but I would be eternally greatful for any food. I would absolutely be over the moon for anything healthy like fruit, vegetables, nuts, yogurt, eggs though! Ive lost a lot of weight from eating ramen for months. Anything that can help me regain streng sounds amazing. 

I don't get paid for about 2 weeks but when I do I can and WILL come back to pay it forward! I can absolutely take verification and thank you photos too. 

My closest store is a Fry's grocery. They do giftcards but also grocery pick up from online carts. I can also make an amazon wishlist. I'm not allergic to anything though! 

Thank you so very much for reading.

misc,My brother needs help and I don't know where else to go... (Failure to launch),"Hey all, my family and I have all been struggling to help my brother get on his feet in life. I am reaching out to Reddit as a last resort as all other efforts have proven to be unsuccessful. I will try to include as much of the important details as possible while at the same time keeping this post concise and to-the-point.

My brother is 23 y/o, currently unemployed, and living in an apartment with me. Nothing seems to truly spark his interest besides video games. He's a very unique fella, and I suspect that he may be on the spectrum but have nothing to back that up. Here's a little bit of a back-story.

After high school graduation he went off to college but failed out after two semesters. He proceeded to move back home and work various minimum wage jobs for several years, such as food delivery driver, factory worker, and landscaping. He has never formally quit a job and has always been fired because of not showing up/being late most of the time. The period of time in-between jobs has never been less than two weeks. He has an inability to save. Most of his money is spent on gas station goods, computer equipment, weed (it is legal in our state of residence), and various other items. To sum this up, he has a chronic spending problem.

My brother does not seem to have any interests other than video games and watching YouTube videos. He doesn't have many friends, and doesn't talk to any girls. We have a gym at the apartment withing walking distance, but I can never get hit to come with me. He has no awareness of world & national event and has little to no desire to learn about much other than the latest video game news. In my honest opinion, he is living in the dark. My family and I have tried to brainstorm ideas with him but hasn't taken a liking to any of them.

Tensions began to grow between him and our stepdad as stepdad saw no sign of my brother moving out and growing out of this phase of life. At this point, I invited my brother to move in to my college apartment. I thought that he may need someone there for him on a day-to-day basis to help him get off his feet. Furthermore, it might help to be surrounded by people who are closer in age to him. I have always tried to motivate him in a positive manner, and seldom do my family members and I come down hard on him as we are all aware of the delicacy of this situation.

My brother has operated on a late sleep schedule for a long time now, but in the past few months it has only gotten worse. He was fired from his last job about three months ago and has been scraping by since. His sleep schedule has evolved into a stay up all-night and sleep all-day kind of deal. He showers only a couple of times a week and rarely does laundry (only when it is absolutely necessary). For the most part the only way to reach him is to physically speak with him. He avoids responsibilities by ignoring texts and calls from both family and friends alike.

His rent is paid for by our father, as he is the lease guarantor and my brother has no money to cover the costs. He now lives off of Christmas money (not much, believe me). It would be easy to say that my parents are enabling my brother's lifestyle, but I have gotten together with them and discussed the alternatives. I am a firm believer that he would simply resort to sleeping in his car if he was cut off. We all want to best for him and would like to see him find a passion, something that motivates him to wake up in the morning. There are a lot of issues here that need fixing but I believe that there are underlying issues here that explain all of this, I just don't know what they might be. My parents have set him up with a psychologist to discuss these problems but as they say, you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink.

If anyone has seen a similar situation to this before, any insight would be hugely appreciated. I don't know where else to go and I am starting to lose hope. If this post fits the scope of another subreddit please comment below. I want nothing more than to hear the internet's take on all of this. The more input the better. Thank you for your time everybody, your thoughts mean the world to my family and I."
basic needs,"Stuck in Hondo, Texas and need to get gas to get to CO Springs","To make a very long story short, I was supposed to come out with my boyfriend over Christmas to meet his family.

It was for personal use, in child proof safety bags (multiple) and I have a red card for it. I would NEVER smoke and drive, i know the rules and wouldn't put my medical card on the line over something like smoking while I was driving. They arrested me and kept me isolation for two weeks and took me cold turkey off my prescribed medication cold turkey.  Anyway. My boyfriend had to use every penny including our rent money, gas and food and hotel money to get home. We were able to get to my sisters house in Hondo Texas to stay the last two nights but we have jobs and appointments and other obligations we have to get back to.

I simply don't know what else to do.  I'm here, so that you may hear my story and just maybe if you connect with my story, and are in the position may offer assistance that will not go to waste and that will live through myself as I too pay it forward as I'm able. My wife and I have just went through 6 months of hell, we have went from homelessness to new jobs and renting a duplex. Two days ago our car broke down and we are both at risk of losing our jobs if we are unable to have the vehicle repaired. We are still living paycheck to paycheck, and we are now extremely scared to have to return to life on the streets. 

6 months ago my wife and I boarded a ride we would never forget. It was a very frightening and trying experience, and in the end it brought us closer. 
I lost my job of 12 years and not long afterwords my wife's employer of 10 years went out of business. Our home, newer vehicles, summer vacations, all faded faster than I can explain. 
We found ourselves struggling to pay for a hotel daily and before long the focus of finding a job and a source of income  quickly shifted to learning how to survive on the streets, and formulating a plan to get our life back.
We fought through dirt and sweat, rain and cold, we learned what it was to be hungry and tired, often times people would avoid eye contact, and we would learn what it meant to feel ""less than human,"" as if our lives simply held no value to this world or our community. We also learned humility and we learned how to be humble. Most importantly we discovered the true strength of our marriage and our love, we learned commitment and dedication, and we learned that we are stringer than we ever thought. 
Many hiked miles, we find a new city, enlist in new jobs, sleep under our roof in a place we are learning to call home, and we purchase a cheap vehicle. The pieces to our new life were falling into place. The prior months of hell finally paying off, and everything went smooth, until, it didn't........

Two days ago my wife dropped me off at work, and proceeded to drive to her new job when our 16 year old car decided to stutter as she tried to drive and ultimately stalled out. The holidays were rough as it was and it took every dollar to have the vehicle towed to a shop, and be told that we are going to have to have the valve body replaced. The best quote we have received is $260.00, my wife works with a woman who happens to have a son that owns his own mechanic shop, and he has offered to do this with no labor cost. 

We are in desparate need of $260 to repair our vehicle so that my wife and I both can keep our jobs. Neither of us have yet to be late at our new jobs. Now, we have far more than being late to fear. Losing our jobs can so easily slide us back into homelessness, and without this repair it seems inevitable."

pets,Hamster found in the snow needs a vet,"Hi everyone,

UPDATE: The hamster has seen the vet, had what turned out to be a large abscess drained, and has been prescribed antibiotics and pain meds. They said he should be back to acting like a healthy hamster in 7-10 days!

Someone in my local area found a pet hamster left outside in the snow- presumably because of the large tumor/growth on its face (pics attached- its on their left side). The person that found the hamster couldn't care for it, so we took it on as my boyfriend and I have experience owning small pets and quickly made a bin cage for the little guy, until we get to the pet store today and get proper bedding, a wheel, etc. However, we need to get him/her looked at as soon as possible so we can treat the tumor on their face, and it'll be a financial hardship on us as we're both working college students and weren't expecting to pay for vet treatment of an additional animal. The campaign is currently just to cover the initial appointment but we will likely raise the amount/ start a new campaign once we know how much it will be to fix whatever is wrong. To clarify, no matter what this hamster is going to receive care on Jan 9th, and we will be paying the veterinarian with CareCredit. However donations will help us out greatly with paying off the CareCredit. Anyone who donates can request more pics of the hammy and even help us name him/her too. Thank you so much!

basic needs,[Request] some help to pay for groceries since I haven't been payed for 6 months..,"Location (Iceland)


Okay so the story of how I got here is a little long, and I don't really expect this to work but I am very desperate..

So I'm a 21 year old father of 2 (2 year old and 9 month old), who Is dealing with severe deppression, anxiety and many other mental health issues as well as having very severe psoriasis covering every part of my body to the point where it is hard to move..  Because of these issues I couldn't keep a job, and my doctor recommended I'd try to go to ""work rehabilitation"" to try and get to a place where being a working man would be more reasonable.

I come from a family where you are not supposed to accept money from the government so I was very hesitant but my psychologist and my doctor convinced me that it's okay to admit when you need help and that it was obvious that I wasn't going to get better without some serious treatment.

I do that, and after about 6 months of work rehabilitation, they tell me that their professional opinion was that my problems were to severe for them to be able to help me right now, and since they didn't expect to be able to get me ready for the job market within the next 6 months, they said I had to apply for disability until I've completed more treatments and then they could take me back and help me get back into working.

So I did.. But there was a problem..

The person who wrote what is called ""the final report"" worded a certain part in a way that was misinterpreted by the government employee handling my application so they thought I hadn't completely finished trying out rehabilitation which is a requirement. This was confirmed as a misunderstanding and they fixed the wording and made it so it was 100% clear that was not the case.

But the damage was done.. they are notorious for never changing their verdict here and even with 100% no way to misinterpret them documents stating that it is fully tried, they deny me disability based on the fact that it wasn't fully tried.. after getting rejected 3 times even after explaining everything and even having them talk with each other (the people who ran the rehabilitation and the government office handling disability) it always ended the same.. So I thought I'd just go back to rehabilitation, I mean that's what they're telling me to do, right? Nope.. I applied again and they denied me do to me being to sick for them to be able to realistically help me..


So they ask me to apply again for disability..

We've issued a kind of ""law suit"" you're supposed to do if you want someone from a different agency to check if they are justified in their denial but I'm not sure if it's gonna work..


But this has taken 6 months.. 6months of no stable paychecks .. I have 2 kids and have no more ways to scrape money.. we owe thousands of dollars to the bank and have no way of getting more loans.. 

My girlfriend has just finished her maternity leave (which was about 900$ a month in a very expensive CoL area, which my whole country is) and has no job to go back to either.. So we have nothing to keep us afloat..


I do have amazing in laws that help a lot so we do have diapers/formula for at least a good chunk of the month, but would appreciate any help for everything else (weather it would be cash deposited to PayPal or food ordered from somewhere and sent to us, doesn't matter)

Anything at all would mean the world to us!

I have been hired to a hospital, but a prescription benzo showed up in my drug test, delaying my process.

bills,Need help catching up on bills,"Hello everyone! This is my first time posting here and my first time asking for help like this so bear with me... 

My fiancé and I currently live in a two bedroom house with our one year old daughter. We have both been dealing with some medical issues. His cost him his job, and I lost mine after taking off too much time to take care of him and myself, not to mention our child who also got sick at some point in this time frame. 

It took awhile but we finally both have jobs again but our savings have been cleaned out because of bills. And we won’t be paid until well after our bills are due. At the moment my phone bill, the electric bill, and the rent are all past due as of tomorrow at 4pm EST. We have cut all expenses and have been using all of our money for bills— meaning we don’t have food either. 

All I am asking for is help with rent and electric so we don’t lose our home, and so we can keep the house warm for our child. I can give specific amounts and proof of the electric bill through PM. (Can’t do this with rent— we do not have any paperwork to prove we live here as we rent from a friend of my father)  I am also willing to try to prove illness if I can find the paperwork from the hospital for myself, if not both of us. 

I would not ask for help if I didn’t truly need it. Anything anyone can do would be so appreciated. Thank you.

Edit: 

If I can pay my electric bill before 4pm EST tomorrow, the total amount needed (with rent) is $807. I will have to call to see how much the late fee is tomorrow when the company opens, so the amount will be more if it is not paid by then. I am willing to send pictures of my electric bill through PM if needed. 

Also currently building a grocery list on amazon, I’ll post that when I’m finished (slow internet— bear with me)

Pretty much all of that is for the baby, minus the rice.

Edit 4: If the internet is correct, it’s possible you can call the electric company and pay the bill over the phone if I share my account number. If you would prefer to help that way rather than sending money (understandable!) I am willing to PM my account number. If the bill is paid before 4pm on 1/9/20, the amount is $307

UPDATE: a friend has loaned me some money for the electric bill and now all that is needed is $200.

basic needs,Accessible Vehicle to Get to work," Hey. My name is Shawn and I'm trying to raise money to purchase an accessible vehicle so that I can get to and from work. When I was 17 I was in a mountain bike accident in British Columbia. It left me a quadriplegic for life.  


Since then, I've been on a journey to better myself and become a productive member of society. I put myself through university and for the last 6 years I've volunteered at a home care facility running its day-to-day operations. However, volunteering does not allow me to support myself so over the last few years I've been applying for a massive number of jobs.  


I'm currently living on government assistance which I desperately want to get off of.  In order to do this I need to work and I need reliable transportation as the job requires traveling around the province of Alberta. Thus, the purpose of my fundraising request. The vehicles they convert are some variation of a mini-van but the cost of the van plus the conversion to allow access to my wheelchair is prohibitively expensive. It costs $39,085.58 CAD for the conversion and $47889.54 for the purchase of the van. This out of the price range of a person on government assistance.   


Your generous donation would be greatly appreciated as it would allow me to work. And working would allow me to break out of the poverty this disability has put me in. It would allow me to marry my girlfriend of 10 years. It would allow me to carry the responsibility of providing for my family. People often say that there is dignity in work and I firmly believe that. I just want to live a dignified life and a reliable vehicle would allow me to achieve that.   


If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

misc,I want to start therapy.,"So I've been wanting to start therapy for a while.  The tl;dr about why I need it is that I was raised by a narcissistic mother and emotionally abused by two exes.  My main problem is that I don't drive, and my city's public transportation isn't that great like in major cities.  Furthermore, my mother makes me take Uber/Lyft to work on her days off, so that can be up to $80/week that I have to spend to get to work. 

I have never gotten a direct answer from anyone on whether or not online therapy is covered by insurance.  However, this is where I want to start, since I work five days a week usually, and that way I can talk to my therapist when I want to.  What I would like to do is go to therapy for a year, then see where I am financially and where I am living by then.  Unfortunately, what my company pays me, my bills and having to use ride sharing prevents me from being able to sign up for it right now.  Any sort of help is appreciated.  Thank you."

So, I’ve been thinking this afternoon about trying to organize some type of drive. My only problem is that my school is in a poverty-stricken area, and I don’t want to encourage them to donate what they don’t have. I thought about doing it as a contest, with the kiddos bringing in change, and the classroom whose change weighs the most wins something? Like a pizza party? Then it wouldn’t be like we’re asking for large cash donations. Except I don’t know if we would raise a lot of money that way. So then I got to thinking that maybe we could partner with a business who would be willing to match our donation. Anyway, I’m looking for suggestions of how I can realistically make a drive work."

misc,Poor College Student in need of clothes,"Hello everyone,

I am a twenty year old college (sophomore, nearly a junior) in an small town on the Ohio River in Ohio. I have recently changed my major from digital simulation and game engineering to early childhood education for special education due to the fact that I could not pass my first engineering classes. I also come from a low to no income family, which means all of the money I have for college is in scholarships and grants. These grants will not cover my degree switch. (Can provide proof if needed) 
So starting in Fall 2020, I will be taking out loans in order to go to college, which is a major change in the full ride tuition money I had. Basically the money that I may possibly receive will go towards buying new clothes for the educator/teacher path that I have set myself on. 

All of the clothes I currently own are graphic tees, leggings, and jeans... All of which are not suitable for teaching. I also have no shoes that are sensible for the teaching path as well.

I can accept anything that will help out.

Thank-you

Edited:  Clothing and Shoe Sizes
I wear a woman's 2xl top, 22petite dress pants, and 10.5w woman's shoes."
misc,Probationer and his girlfriend,"I'm 21 living on my own in a house owned by my girlfriend's dad's house. She's 19. We both have mental health issues we're working on and supporting each other through all of it.

Early December she was living with me at my parent's, and we got kicked out. She was on food stamps, and we worked hard for any sort of small jobs we could find for $20 here or $15 there. 

Unfortunately, as I type this I'm using the neighbor's WiFi. We are completely broke, with no active cell service. We're struggling to find work because employers aren't emailing us back. We're relying on her dad and an unemployed housemate with 2 young daughters.

I want to switch to a cheaper phone plan just so we can accept calls for work, and talk to family.

Now to the **emergency**: I have to drive an hour for a legal meeting and if I miss it I could end up in serious trouble. I am asking anyone from the kindness of their heart, to PLEASE feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer them to the best of my ability.

I am *begging* for just $20 to have the gas to make it where i need to go and back. Anything else is seriously appreciated, and will go towards switching to the cheapest phone plan I can find so her and I can take more steps to get our life together straightened out.

I'm working as hard as I can, to the best of my ability. We have both been diagnosed with major depression each within the last 6 months, and have been together only a couple.

I am on probation because of a manipulative ex-girlfriend from over a year ago, that led to me attempting suicide.

Hell, my car is uninsured and unregistered for a few months now."
education,College student in need of assistance paying bank fees,"
Over the past month, I’ve accumulated over $300 worth of NSF fees due to automatic/recurring payments. I reached out to Bank of America in hopes of getting some of the fees waived, but the representative I spoke with basically told me there was nothing that could be done.

I’m currently a college student, and starting my spring semester next week. I don’t receive any financial assistance, and will have to pay for my own books/tuition out of my own pocket, on top of these fees and other financial priorities. 

I understand there’s some accountability to be taken on my part for letting the fees accumulate and not taking necessary action sooner. All I’m asking is for a little assistance in helping get back on my feet. Even a little bit helps tremendously. Thanks.

basic needs,Floridian venturing north of the state line in need of winter wear,"I posted a while ago about needing gas and vehicle maintenance to get out of town on. There was no response to that post so I’m reaching out for winter wear because whatever funds I can come up with will go to the travel expenses. I won’t have anything to work with to get proper clothing on top of travel expenses . I’ve been out of work for a long time as I’m disabled and was applying for social security. Due to circumstances I can’t wait for the determination. I got hired for a job that still hasn’t gone through yet. I have to make money to get home on because suddenly the place I live at is being sold. I thought I had more time being that the deadline was August... then June... now it’s March. But considering a recent turn of events I need to get out as soon as possible. My significant other is a recovering alcoholic (sober almost 2 years) that has relapsed and I need to get gone MUCH sooner than March. ASAP.  The change of plan with him not going with me adds to the level of broke I’m going on. The situation is volatile. I have a mental illness and this kind of thing has a really bad effect on me. So I will be leaving as soon as I get enough to cover the travel expenses whether I have clothes yet or not. 
I’ll be traveling with a small dog and two cats. I have hardly any clothes even for Florida and I have zero clothing for anything under 70 degrees. I prefer donation of clothing you already have but no longer wear. I’ve seen the amazon wishlist in other posts so I created one in case someone out there wants to look at it and see if they have any similar items. I also left the list open for editing in case someone out there knows of an item I would need that I don’t know about yet ( I’m not familiar with cold weather necessities) if you do have suggestions add it to the wishlist for me. I am 5 foot 2 , 190 lbs, female. My size is around an extra large.  Both male and female clothes are fine (I even have some male clothing on the wishlist.. cheaper and does the same thing..) I’m short, but if the pants or sleeves are too long I can hem them. shoe size is anywhere between 8 and a half and 9 and a half. The conditions of the clothing matters none to me. If it’s stained.. worn... doesn’t matter as long as I can put it on and get warmth, the appearance is the least of my worries. It’s 60 something degrees right now in Florida and My feet have been like ice for 3 days (no.. not every Floridian is like this.. I’m anemic so I’m always colder than the people around me) so anyone that got  new winter socks for Christmas and you need to get rid of the old ones I would LOVE to have them! And the 10lb pup could use some warm clothes too if someone out there has any their pet no longer uses. He’s really old so his bones won’t like the cold. 
Also.. if anyone knows any cold weather tips for animals.. vehicles relocating from warm area to cold area tips.. cheap travel road trip tips... any and all advice is welcome. I haven’t been in this kind of situation since I was in my early 20s and times have changed so let me know if you know!

pets,The little love of my life needs help...,"He's my best friend, my emotional support, and the first real love of my life.  My 13 year old miniature Dachshund is suddenly limping on both front legs. I'm on disability from complications of a surgery 5 years ago and recently had my step daughter move in with us.  We've had a lot of things go wrong in the past 3 months and I haven't been able to catch up.  I need to get my dog into the vet.  I don't qualify for care credit and I have been unable to find any other help so I'm coming to you.  If you can help at all, please do.  I would appreciate you and your kindness very deeply.  He is literally like my child and I can't afford to get him help. Thanks again.

Edit: We managed to find a vet that will give us a complimentary visit tomorrow Jan 10th.  It only covers the visit but we will have more information on what is wrong.  I've tried care credit and scratch pay but with bad credit those are just a no go. Will update again tomorrow."
medical,Going Through a Tough Medical Situation,"My name is Devin and I am almost 20 years old. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis three years ago, as well as GERD two months ago)

I’ve never been in remission, it’s always been a long downhill battle. I’ve been hospitalized for a total of 90 days now. Countless small procedures and surgeries. 

It’s been very hard on me and my family. We’ve always had a very healthy family. It was super sudden and shocking for everyone when my brother and I were diagnosed in the same week, he is 21. Fortunately, he has been in remission for almost two years. 

Because of the constantly worsening flare up, I’ve been exposed to some very rare infections. My immune system is so shot from the biologics I’ve been on, steroids, and many other meds, as well as malnutrition and anemia.  The worst being Staph Aureus Bacteraemia, and a super rare bacteraemia, but I can’t remember the name.  The doctors say it’s a miracle I’m still alive after everything. It’s one of the worst colitis case they’ve ever seen. 

There is hope for the future. Finally I am on a biologic that seems to be starting to help. I’ve been able to lower medication doses. I had to be put on lots of pain medication from the severe pain I had daily. Finally that’s come a lot down. I’m also on all the nausea medication you can think of, the most expensive being Intramuscular Gravol I am on over 15 different medications daily, and 14 of them are covered. Unfortunately not the IM Gravol (dimenhydrinate). 

It’s very expensive, but it just so happens to be the medication that helps the most for my nausea. I’ve tried CBD oil, I’m on Nabilone, as well as 5 more including Ondansetron. Altogether, the Gravol is around $400 every month. I’ve had to spend just under $3,000 on it now. Without it, I can barely move many times during the day because of how bad the nausea is. I throw up constantly. The nausea, as well as some other bad symptoms, make it so I have to miss many days of work. That makes it so I’m losing a lot of money that way as well. 

It would be extremely helpful for the cost of the IM Gravol alone to be covered. I would be so so thankful. Unfortunately I just can’t afford i. I’m going in to quite a big debt. With the costs of school, other health care stuff, and everything else, that’s already enough. Without the Gravol, I wouldn’t be able to function normally in a day. I wouldn’t be anywhere close to myself, even though I already am far from the athletic cross country runner I used to be. It at least helps me through the day. 

Having that money reimbursed would help me be able to pay back my parents. They’ve been a big help for lending me that money for it. I love them so much, and it’s killing me to see the financial trouble they’re going through now, I really want to pay them back. It’s been a hard year for them. After losing a close sister, seeing what their two boys are going through, and much more, it hurts me so much that they are always willing to lend more to make it so I will feel better. I truly am thankful for it. But it’s hurting me to see them going through this hard time. We all are. 

I know it’s a lot to ask for. I’m not expecting anything at all. I am super thankful for what I have now. It would be the biggest help to have it reimbursed. A gift from God. I love all of you and thank you for taking the time to read this.

She is a college student who will be graduating in a few months and will have a class to teach on her own. She will be an art teacher, teaching elementary students here in Kansas. At the moment, she is an assistant at an elementary school.  

She can only purchase so many supplies on her own for her current classes, and is also trying to get a head start setting up her future classroom. To her knowledge, they will give you funds to help you start, but it won’t nearly be enough. She will have to use out-of-pocket money to buy the rest of her supplies.

 I can prove all this stuff with pictures and receipts of course.

I’m young (22), and will admit that I’ve never really had to look after my finances to such an extreme before. I made the poor decision of taking out credit cards so that I could pay my rent and living costs. 

I am now in almost £8000 credit card debt, with an old payday loan debt and bills creeping up on me. My family are not in a position to help.

THANK YOU to everyone who sent diapers, we appreciate the help so much, you’re all incredible!!

My sister and her husband just suddenly got custody of her sister in law’s 3 kids (all  3 years old and under) and has a 2 year old of her own. CPS removed the kids from the mother and my sister was the only person willing to take all of them to keep the kids together. Otherwise they would have gone to separate strangers. 

They are 9 months, 2 years and 3 years old. The 2 year old is SEVERELY autistic and needs round the clock care or else she injures herself. 

While they need an abundance of help, the one thing she says she really needs is size 4 diapers because the autistic toddler goes through several diapers a day. 

My family has been helping as much as we can but ANY additional help would be immensely appreciated, just PM me please and thank you everyone in advance!!

**EDITED TO ADD** also any 18 m or 24m clothing/pajamas. The other two kids have supplies but the toddler with autism was poorly taken care of before and doesn’t have much as of yet."

Waiting on insurance reimbursement, and the fraud department of my bank to recognize and reimburse me a significant amount. This should have been over a month-and-a-half ago but as of right now my pup and I are still living in our car. My storage unit is going up for auction. If this happens, all of my papers regarding the bank, promissory note, title to my car 3 insulin pens insurance papers and my best friend's ashes are all gone. The late charge is actually more than what the rent is. I am also not eating properly. I had to apply for food stamps three times and they were finally going to be here in 7 to 10 days. I haven't been here long enough to qualify for food pantry. I have been to the food pantry in my town and they only help you once a month. They gave me five cans of vegetables a can of sloppy Joe mix + 6 cheese sticks. I'm not picky cuz I didn't even have a can opener at the time. I have quite a few small kitchen appliances that I had bought to go in my tiny house. These are things that are in the storage shed that I can sell. I don't know how much longer I have to wait for this money to come in but if I have to fight the bank, approximately $26,000, I have no proof if I lose my storage shed. If I have to refile the insurance for any reason, I'm screwed and having to sue my sister, I will be screwed. No hope of me getting back on my feet. If I lose my best friend's ashes, I will have a awful hard time living with myself. I would like to ask for some help eating. I'm putting gas in my car to help keep us warm. I had to ask for help a few weeks ago and somebody that was kicked off of this site made some very ugly comments about me that broke my heart. He became drunk and misunderstood a comment that I made. I saw some posts he made but he had already been banned prior to me seeing his posts. He wrote me some very beautiful messages as well. I had nothing to do with him being banned.
 I have tried churches and 211 and I'm going to continue to try but I'm getting nowhere. I have a GoFundMe that might help explain a few things and why I can't work. The money that I'm asking for help with on the storage shed can be paid directly to them. I am very capable of proving everything I'm saying. Please forgive the long post. I'm very grateful that this site exists and for the people that helped me the last time to be able to take a shower and wash clothes eat and put gas in my car. They made me feel human again. I hate that I'm having to ask for help. I just don't really have much of a choice. I have had hard times in my life but never this bad financially. My pup has never known a time that I couldn't buy her treats or take her to the vet. Her personality has changed significantly in the last 2 months. I'm sorry for any formatting issues. I was attacked at a Truck Stop bathroom recently by a woman that was absolutely insane. Thankfully I wasn't hurt but it did break my phone. BTW, if anybody has an old phone laying around that would be compatible with Metro PCS, I could really use one.

basic needs,Post treatment cancer patient going back to work. Gas.,"Hi everyone. So my cancer adventure has come to an end and I have been cleared for work. 

I can offer proof of nearly any kind. 

Reddit has been amazing to me especially the people over on food pantry- they’ve been exceedingly kind. 

I am able to go back to work immediately. The obstacle to returning to work is having enough gas to get through until what would be my first payday. 

I contacted the American cancer society about gas cards. Nothing available in this area. 

I’ve called food banks and Salvation Army. They don’t offer them. 

I live in a little town called Latham, Ks. We do not have Uber or Lyft or any of that, that’s how remote we are. 

My family is on an extremely fixed income and poor to be honest. Prior to cancer I helped them. 

So what do I need to get back out there to work and go back to the real world? Gas. 

It is 63 miles one way to Wichita. That’s 126 miles round trip per day. I will be returning to work at six days per week.

My first real full paycheck will be 2/1/20.

I’m looking for help with the gas which I’m estimating at 120.00-130.00.

Edit: down to 100.00 needed. 

I’m going to work tomorrow - I have enough to get there and back and right now every penny counts so I don’t want to miss any chance to earn money. 

I asked my supervisor about an advance. Essentially since I’ve been gone during treatment I wouldn’t qualify. I would need four paychecks under my belt.

So, here I am.

I can accept: Paypal and Venmo, Apple Pay edit: and cash app. 

I have nothing to hide and can accept reasonable requests for proof. 

PS. I will not be declared no evidence of cancer until two years of clean scans but it’s looking good. 

Thanks for looking as always Reddit and thanks for the downvoting. Classy."

Pets,My Dog Daisy's Lipoma Removal Surgery," On April 1, 2017 we adopted her, she had a rough time with her other owners, but we made sure she would never feel alone.  


A couple months back, her thigh was starting to get a lump about the size of a marble, then grew to the size of a grapefruit.  It obviously makes her uncomfortable but she still manages to be the happiest dog around.

misc,Threat of car repo driving my mental health into the ground.,"Hi all,

So I think I'd posted here before asking for advice but most people just said to let the car go and just ""save up for a cheaper car."" That's absolute worst case scenario.

To break it down, I'm in my early twenties living with an abusive mother because the old place I had after my first college dropout ended up becoming a near literal traphouse. Roommates doing coke frequently, not a good environment as I'd finally come to an upswing of mental health that had me on only one medication to manage my anxiety, no pot smoking, and I was about to quit cigarettes (have been smoking for nearly a decade now). The issue I've ran into is that with both my mental health and physical condition (full-body arthritis) it's extremely difficult for me to manage a full time, on my feet position just in order to make enough money to pay my bills. I'd been working a decent paying butcher job when I got my car, and made payments early with no issue.

Today marks the second due date of my car payment I'm late on, and my biggest struggle is the APR of 15.91% on my auto loan. I've found other banks as low as 5.72% but with my poor credit (maxed credit cards I'd been making small payments on since I've never held a job over $12/h to give me more to send that way with enough for food, medical supplies, other household items after bills. The car I've been using to drive for Lyft with how that form of work allows me to not be in physical pain all the time. However with the current stress of not pulling in enough to make the car payments on top of what other bills I'm behind on.. The car is about 12k and my 1k since May has primarily gone towards interest alone. 

That being said, I'm the only driver in my household. Only one licensed. We live outside a college town but to the point where getting to any job would require bike-riding or walking, both of which I struggle with as frequent travel this way would send me to the doctor in a matter of days, which has been the main stickler in my job consistency as none of my employers really gave me the flexibility in my schedule that I'd always been assured of during onboarding.

I'm in the process of appealing my third Social Security application through a pro-bono law firm that's spoken highly of in my area, but my case manager informed me the process usually takes up to a year. Without my car I can't make money through Lyft, can't go grocery shopping, and can't go to my bi-weekly counseling/psychiatry appointments which are detrimental to my wellbeing.

Food stamps I can't receive, although I had been approved living in my own during the process, the sudden shift home led to denial with my mother being on disability and making too much to qualify for herself, essentially sweeping me under her decision because I live with her.

I don't have any family closeby (nearest is over an hour drive and it's my 70 year old grandfather), and I literally do not have anyone who could help with rides due to conflicting schedules and just lack of disposable aid, which I'm not upset about in the slightest. I respect my friend's lives and it's hard enough burdening the few I have discussed when as much as they'd like to, they can't help. My mother doesn't assist in any of my bills spare the roof over my head and my phone. My brother picked up the electric bill but barely has much left from that. My plan all in all is to move out and get my own place for privacy (I don't have my own room) and a place to get rest after work.

As far as employment, I'm trying to figure out how to find work more suitable for my conditions so I can actually hold a job longer than 4-6 months, and one that doesn't have me living from paycheck to paycheck. In terms of education I have an associate's for graphic design that I haven't used because of a lack of a recent portfolio, and after dropping out of college twice due to stress at home and my mental health affecting work quality in the jobs I've had for their short time, I feel completely at a loss. I'm scared I'm going to lose my car if I don't make money fast, but I don't know my options and am desperately in need of guidance to help me figure this out.


All advice is welcomed, but please, for the sake of me not having a panic attack I'd like to try and avoid the notion of just letting my car get repo'd as I've put too much into it already and still can't stand the thought of fucking up something I had such high hopes for considering this is the first auto financing I've ever done.

Thank you for reading.

update(1): Managed to make around $50 to throw at the bank, praying that'll take some heat off of the repo fear. I've got therapy later today and I'm in the verge of tears knowing I have to tell her what I'm dealing with and that I won't have rides to even stay in therapy anymore.

update(2): Got in about five hours of sleep, woke up to my mother getting hundreds of dollars worth of new shit after telling my brother the car is most likely gone soon he just said ""who cares."" I have therapy in an hour but I'm reaching my mental fucking limit.

update(3): Therapy earlier helped calm me down drastically, and with the people who commented thanks so much for the advice because I'm not gonna let this day end in a negative mindset. I appreciate it!"

So, here we go, I guess... I'm currently stuck in a situation where my water has been disconnected, and I'm struggling to come up with the funds. I spoke with the water department, and I need to pay $118 to restore my service, of which I have $20 in my bank, hopefully, another $20 if this person from FB buys my old computer monitor, as they said they would. (Why do people love to say they want things, but never manage to show up?? Frustrating lol) I have other things posted for sale on FB, but it seems rough going after the holidays, sadly. 

I really don't know what else to say, as I've never asked for assistance in this manner, so if I'm leaving anything out, or if you have questions, please feel free to inbox me. Thank you for reading, and I hope you're having a wonderful new year!"

EDIT: I finished the post, sorry about that.

For anyone who didn't see my post last week; I'm disabled and live with my boyfriend and his 3 kids from a previous marriage that he has 50/50 custody of. He left his job to accept a job offer for a better paying job. But the hiring process has taken around a month now. He starts his new job any day now, he had his physical today and passed so it's just a waiting game to start working. Once he is working everything will be fine. 

But now our water was shut off and even with emergency assistance the soonest we could get it back on is the end of the week, and that's only if he can get a hold of all the documents they need by then. We didn't know it was THIS close to being shut off. 

Any help would be so greatly appreciated. And as I said on my last post, we will be forwarding all help we receive once he starts working. If anyone needs proof of our bill or anything I can get that for you. 

Thank you for reading. Thank you for the previous help with food.


ETA: The reason this is urgent is cuz we have no clean dishes as we weren't expecting this, so we can't clean any dishes to cook anything. There are animals here that don't have access to water. His ex wife is known to throw custody in his face and not having running water for the kids is already a bad thing if you don't have someone up your butt about custody. We were already only drinking tap water as we have nothing else to drink here. We've been doing our best to tough through this, but losing water makes it impossible."

basic needs,Food,"My girlfriend is on her way home and has had a bad day. We have both had really crappy winters so far, actually. I came out to my parents and they aren’t speaking to me, I was hospitalized for half of December, and my car was stolen the day before Thanksgiving. My girlfriend ‘s job has been pretty rough lately and on New Year’s Day she fell and broke two teeth and fractured her kneecap. Things have been...not great! 

I would like to surprise her with some pizza or Chinese food as a treat, but I am completely broke until Thursday. She had to borrow $20 for gas from a coworker today, so I know she is similarly broke. Would anyone be willing to help this sad sack (me) and their gorgeous girlfriend with a hot meal tonight?"

We should be able to get calfresh pretty soon, but we would really appreciate if someone could help us get food today.

I have PayPal and cash app if anyone can help.

Thank You

Edit: I think the way I worded a sentence my have given the wrong impression. We are not homeless because my mother couldn't uber/doordash, we became homeless due to outside circumstances unrelated to her job."

I recently lost my car this week to a break line and while fixing it is an entire different problem, I have a bigger one. I’m living out of my car currently so I’m homeless. I was able to pay for a weekend at this extended stay, but I do not have any money to extend my stay any longer. Checkout was this morning and I walked to my gym where I’ve been at all day.

I'm trying to scrape up money for rent and no one can really help me from them having Christmas and all. And also I don't have many friends that can help me. My mom is struggling to pay rent and take care of my sisters so she can't help me. I can't donate plasma cause I'm a diabetic with bad sugars cause I never see a doctor cause I just can't afford it.

I have 135 after selling stuff but I don't have anything else to sell really. I live with my friend but shes strict with rent. It's only 175$ cause I pay half of hers. And there electricity coming up. Im sure I can get electricity but I need help with 40$? If anyone can help me? I'm so fucked on rent right now I can't even buy food for myself. It's a small rent to pay but I'm struggling so much that 40$ is a lot. Please and thank you. I've been on Reddit for the past 2-3 years and this is the first time I'm reaching out to this sub cause I'm genuinely in need of help right now.

Pets,Two rescue dairy calves need donations,"Hey there, 

My sister and her boyfriend care for a herd of Galloway cattle, have rescued one male calf from a dairy farm in August and are in the process of rescuing another dairy calf that was born blind. The herd used to be raised for meat, but when my sister and her boyfriend took over, they decided to end the killing and to let the animals live in peace. Dairy calves are more expensive to raise than Galloways because they can't be outside day and night all year, they need grain on top of grass and hay and they are much more prone to disease.

We have set up a Gofundme page with more information and pictures here https://www.gofundme.com/f/rescued-blind-calf-and-her-friend-need-help
PayPal is also available. 

We are thankful for all donations, let me know if you need more details."
bills,I desperately need help paying my rent... if you help by donating I will make you a wire tree!,"Hello everyone. My name is Nick and I've recently come into some really hard times. 2019 was an awful year for me. I lost my girlfriend of several years, I recently lost my job due to things out of my control, and my living situation is now in jeopardy and I may be homeless if I cannot figure out a solution. My rent is now past due, and I am really scared and desperate for help.

So here is some backstory on me... if you don't care to read that's ok, it's mostly me venting I guess. You can skip to the next paragraph if not.

I don't like getting handouts. I grew up in Maine where hard work and manners was the standard. My father was a carpenter with his own business for over 20 years and I definitely picked up his creative gene. When I was 18 my mother left my after being married for 21 years. It wasn't until my father committed suicide on Thanksgiving day when I woke up and realized how unhappy they both were. I was living at home with him in the same house when it happened and They gave me and my sister such an amazing life but looking back, I think we always sort of knew they were unhappy. I just never thought this hardworking, stubborn, genuine man would leave the way he did. Needless to say I have been such a wreak ever since. I tried moving away as far as I could to forget my pain. California is where I now live, but let me tell you, being on my own has been so hard. I'm severely depressed and have been for a long time. I had a relationship with someone who slowly developed a bipolar disorder and ultimately completely ruined my self esteem. Now, it's made relationships so hard for me as I was abused physically and mentally, cheated on, lied to, stolen from... the list goes on. My credit was ruined because of this girl I dated a long time ago so even finding a good apartment or taking out loans is almost impossible. I then dated another who was an absolute angel. Supportive, kind, genuine... she was the one. She grew up with a Mexican/Persian background and I am very white. Her parents both despised me just because I was white and I never could have a real relationship. In every situation, holiday, event, celebration, they always made their daughter choose them over me. I spend/spent every holiday alone and the relationship had been a secret for the last year, which is how bad it had gotten. In the end, it wasn't healthy and she left me. Everything sucks. I have no idea why I have it this hard but I really hope it gets better...

So a few years ago I came across an artist online (I can't remember the name) who was making these really small bonsai trees out of wire and really thought they were special. I wanted to see if I could make them and sure enough, I could! I couldn't stop making them. I ended up making about 7 in the first week. They are extremely time consuming but I love it. Some were really large, but most were small as I was still practicing the technique. I wasn't sure what to do with them at the time so I gave them all away to friends and family as gifts for Christmas.

Anyways I currently live alone and am 3000 miles away from all my friends and family. I have no support group where I am and have no way to take out loans without a job.

Then I had an idea...

I thought instead of begging for money, maybe I can give back to those who help donate to me!

I thought maybe if people who donate $50+ will get their own wire tree of their choosing! If you donate a larger amount (maybe $100+?) I will send you a much bigger wire tree if you want it! 

My rent is $1400 so any help at all is greatly appreciated.

Below I am attaching some pictures of the ones I've made in the past so you can see how big they are. I am attaching below as many pictures as I can so you can see!

Thank you for your time.

misc,My dog lost her only puppy and I'm unsure how to be strong for her,"My pup went through a very rough pregnancy. She was very small for a pregnant dog (shes a pitty) so the vet thought she was experiencing a fake pregnancy. Turns out she only had 1 pup in the womb. Yesterday they called for an emergency C section at 62 days (luckily my mom was more than willing to help with the costs so I could get my baby into surgery, which I will truly never ever forget.. She saved her life) and the puppy didn't make it. Im completely heart broken. The baby was beautiful. Just this perfect little thing. As I was holding her while my dog was being sewn up and in her recovery kennel, we got to spend time with the little one. I just kept expecting her to start moving. To wiggle around and grunt and whine. She had been gone for a few days and her little lip was already peeling. We've had some legal issues with the studs owners so to lose the only baby we had just crushed me and my fiance. Bless his heart, when I asked about the cost of our little angel's ashes and it was out of my price range, he jumped in immediately saying he wanted to buy them and didn't care about how much it cost. I will never forget that. They say our girl doesn't know she was pregnant and she just feels like she had a great nap, but i know she knows. I know she's crushed by this, and I know she feels the pain of us losing the little one right along with her. I haven't felt a pain like this in a long time. Its deep within my chest and I feel hollow. I want to be strong for her, I need to be... But just thinking of how perfect that 1 baby was.... Im just devastated. I should've taken her to get an ultrasound. I should've taken her in when I felt something was off on December 27th. I should've listened to my gut. Everyone told me she was fine. That everything was normal. And I really can't forgive myself for letting my girl and her baby down.

Edit: we will be focusing on her and not getting another dog, thank you for the insight

P.S. I don't intend to get any donations from this post, it really is just to gain support and reassurance, however I'd be more than happy to accept any donations to go towards paying my mom back for the vet bill faster than I am capable. Im missing some work so I can help my baby recover from surgery so help is definitely appreciated ❤ However like i said, it isnt what this post is for :)"

I'm sad and I don't know why I'm sad, today I sat in my car in front of my school and called in sick because I was at the brink of crying, I don't know why
So because I can't afford professional help I'm here to see if I can get the next best thing, someone to talk to that aren't related to me 

I could make a long post about everything that is wrong but I feel like that wouldn't be the right place to start a long rant, people that think they can help and care to listen are more then welcome to ask for more information"
,I need help with an email I want to send to my District Manager regarded the General Manager of the store I work in.,"Title pretty much says it all.

,Medical Bill Assistance,"Hi there, this is my first time posting here, please correct any missteps. 

I’ve had ongoing medical issues my whole life and 2019 was one of the worst. Now my medical bills are way more than I can afford to pay back. 

Any and all assistance is appreciated. I’ve tried to apply for assistance through the provider, but I make too much on paper to qualify for assistance.  

My current wages are being garnished for bankruptcy and the rest of my money goes to rent and student loans. 

Thank you all so much. Happy New Year!"
,I would really appreciate if you could help us pay the vet bill,"We have two wonderful dogs, one is 8 years old and the other is 15 (will be 16 this April!). They're sweet girls, both rescues, incredibly ~~dumb~~ smart in their own way.

Unfortunately, the older they get, the more often we need to visit the vet with them. Today I went with them for the first time (it's always my sister who takes them) and I learnt we owe the vet 400zł (this equals to 105,68 dollars, according to google). Vet, while super kind, warned me that this is the last time she can help our old girl, since she can't be helping and giving us medicine and covering our bills indefinitely. I totally understand. I'm ever so grateful she did so much to us so far. 

I'm chronically sick, which doesn't allow me to get a hold of any job (and ""unfortunately"" my life is not in constant risk of death, so while I qualified for the hospital, I need to wait in the queue to get accepted), otherwise I'd try to pay it myself. But as it is now... I'm worried what might happen next time our dogs get sick. 

Since the debt is just mounting up, it's clear that my family can't afford to pay it off. I don't even get paid. (Which explains why they haven't told me about this before - they knew I couldn't help, so they didn't want to worry me).

If any of you could send us any money, so we could start paying it off, that would be a massive help for us. Any amount we pay off this bill might make the vet more lenient next time we show up."
,Affordable Housing or a job,"My wife and I live in Arlington virginia and just received a 5 day to pay or quit notice from out landlord. I finished my contact with the army in october, and havent been able to find work since. I need help desperately, my wife gives birth in march and I cannot find a job or affordable housing.

,Need help making it to training for a potential job and advice on becoming financially responsible.,"A little background, I quit my job in November. I regret quiting everyday, because of the position I'm in right now. Basically it was a manual labor job on a farm, and I worked crazy hours. 2:00 AM to 4:30 PM. 14 days on, one day off. I was exhausted all the time, it was really impacting my mental health, and my manager ultimately just pushed me over the edge. I caved. I'm not proud of quitting. 

I applied to a ton of jobs right after and found one that I was really excited about. Working with children in a therapy setting. I interviewed for it (and other positions), all went well but it took so long for people to get back to me (I think the time of year had a lot to do with that) and I've ran out of money, after paying this months bills.

I haven't saved, I've always lived paycheck to paycheck. Reality is setting in and I've started realizing that I need to get it together. I started watching Dave Ramsey and made a budget. I feel super lost and ashamed... my parents didn't teach me about anything financial. I don't know what I'm doing.

Anyway, the job I mentioned above emailed me tonight offering me the position, but I don't have the gas money to make it to the 40 hr, week long training class appx. 40 miles from where I live. I honestly don't know if I should accept the position and waste their time, if I can't make it to training. 

Any ideas for making money quickly or advice to someone just starting their journey to financial responsibility would be truly appreciated. 

Thank you.

,If possible need some groceries for my kids. Was laid off a couple weeks ago.,"Hello everyone, I hate to ask for assistance but its rough this week already. Me and my family have been doing decently for the last few months thankfully to the job I had. Well 2 weeks ago that job randomly laid off 30 of their workers (including me). I got my last paycheck last week but they had shorted me almost a whole week leaving me with very little food. We're down to a couple boxes of mac and cheese and one pack of hotdogs. I start a new job this Thursday and it has  instant pay thankfully (instant pay is a new thing where you work one day and get paid the next). With all that said I could really use some help getting by till Friday. I'm not sure how to do a Walmart pickup wishlist but if anyone is available to help I'd gladly make a list on notepad and send it. I'm sorry to ask so much and hope everyone reading this a great day/night. Thanks so much for your time.

These last few years I’ve worked for a couple of good paying, and AMAZING companies. Here’s a list of anyone in need of something. (All listed have paid training and are w2 employeement opportunities.)

First : https://full.io/jobs/us
Full Creative is basically an answering service for numerous companies. They only hire in a few select states. They are an absolute FANTASTIC company to work for an I highly recommend them. (Pay is bi-weekly, they offer direct deposit or pay card)

Second: https://www.ttecjobs.com/en/work-from-home
TTEC/Teletech offers at home call center type positions. (Tech support/Customer Service)  I worked with them for about a year, and they are also highly recommended. (Pay is bi-weekly)

Third: https://www.kellyservices.us/us/other/kellyconnect-workathome/
KellyServices is much like TTEC. They offer numerous positions and have good pay as well. (Pay is weekly - every Friday )

I know it isn’t much, but these jobs are always hiring and get back to you quickly. They also offer pretty decent benefits & a 401k!

Good luck to anyone applying and if you have any questions at all about anything feel free to send a message or comment my way! I’d be more than happy to help. :)"

,[REQ] transit for job and meetings (Montreal),"Homeless and unemployed in Montreal.

These are all in different areas of town, and my transit card currently only has 2 trips loaded on it. Single fares are $3.50, a 3-day pass (most practical for this request) is $19.50, and a 10-trip package (practical and flexible) is $29.00. And this is a long shot but probably worth mentioning, a monthly pass is $86.50.

PayPal is the best option (cashapp and venmo aren't available in Canada), e-transfer is also an option if you're also in Canada."
,Georgia family (my friends) are stuck in a van following life-saving neck surgery,"Hello all,

I have some good friends, and they need some serious help. They don't use Reddit, so I'm posting this on their behalf. i have filled out the Assistance form before, but will do so again if needed. I also believe I have more than the required karma. Anyway, these friends are a family of 4 plus a cat and elderly dog. I'll try my best to explain their predicament while keeping personal information out of it.

One member of this family just had neck surgery for cervical cranial instability (CCI), which was caused by a rare genetic disease. She had to choose a surgeon several states away, because this doctor was the only CCI surgeon who was familiar with her genetic disease. So this family travels out of state, she has the surgery, has several strokes during recovery, and has embarked on a slow, difficult recovery from there.

Then, their housing arrangement fell through, and the former friends they were renting from told them they had to leave out of spite. So they packed up as much as they could and moved in with a family member while she recovered. Except now, that family member kicked them out as well. I don't know why, but it's probably nothing they did wrong, as these friends are drug-free and alcohol-free. But anyway, this family member kicked them out, and now they're living out of a van . . . while she's trying to recover from life-saving neck surgery.

They made it back to Georgia, and they've been looking for a place ever since their housing arrangements fell through. The parents are both on disability for legitimate reasons, and on the rare occasion that they find a place within their budget, it doesn't allow pets. So they both have complicated health issues, they're living out of a van with children and pets, they're trying to find housing, and she's trying to recover from invasive surgery . . . all while trying to pay off said surgery. And she doesn't qualify for the hospital's financial assistance program because she's out of state.

Their biggest need right now is solid housing in Georgia, or at least ideas that could lead them to solid housing. They have looked into section 8 housing, but the waiting list is so long that it's not feasible for them. I have also helped them with GoFundMe. So they need something more. The other ideas I'll be sending their way are:

Edit: My friends have no physical address right now, so mailing them items isn't feasible, unfortunately. I am not physically able to drive, either, and they need this help ASAP, so PayPal, Venmo, etc would be best. I don't want anyone's personal information, and neither do my friends. They just need a boost so they can get into some permanent housing. Thank you all!"

,18yo Need advice.,"I just started a job I have been temporarily getting rides to and from work and need a car, I have about 1 grand saved up, what’s the smartest/best way to get a car? -didn’t have any type of figure in my life to teach me all of this. 

Thanks."
,Therapy,I (13f) have mental issues and it's starting to affect my physical health. My school won't give me counseling due to how much school ive missed and my family can't afford to pay a therapist. If anyone can help I would be eternally grateful.
,Out of Confidence and feel people have too high expectations from me.,"I feel like I am gonna be the poster boy of things not to do in College. I focused too much on Extra-Curriculars to try to change the old and conservative thoughts of my university's administration which is among the best ones in my country and I have been fighting a battle of sort to try to succeed for more than 1.5 years now, over the course of which I do not manage time , IF i ever start studying, I get some work due to my ECs. I have had Alumni praise me over and over about the work I do , and how they hoped someone did what I do back when they were here. Heck , even seniors call what I do quite motivating. But they all dont know the reality of my academics , sadly which in the world that atleast I live in , Matters a lot. A GPA will define my ability to get a job, my ability to pursue my dreams of an MBA in my Dream School.(which I think is over now, unless i miraculously become a billionaire). It feels like everything that can go wrong, is going wrong.   


We worked on a project for a month, only to not get a chance to present it to the thousands of people we were originally supposed to. Family has a lot of quarrels just due to economic issues which ruins the harmony in the house (although an okayish month long holiday comparatively). My love life sucks, the girl I am with, I cannot dump her (because I think it's unethical to be pyhsical \[no we haven't done that much, but still a lot\] , and leave. She is self-obssesed and she hurt my self confidence yesterday way much by speaking about the thing I was most proud of so far in my college life. To top it off, when I landed in college this sem at 4 am. I saw that I had failed for the first time in my life. (Not to mention I was at one point ranking in top 99 percentile in the nation).   


I dont know if this rant will help me, but please if you can, just be human, be subtle. No overdrama , no extra motivational quotes, I know this is life. But somehow it seems that it is falling apart."

,"Found a code for a free medium burger king coffee, anyone want it?","Edit: Coffee Claimed!

I found one of those whopper wonderland codes and remembered that I hadn't entered it in my app yet. I had gotten two free coffee codes and only entered one of them and the second one should still be usable until the 15th. Does anyone want it? I'll give it to the first person who asks in the comments.

I know a coffee isn't much, but I thought someone might like one."
,Recommendations Needed,Recommendations needed for budget friendly chicken free dog food. (Both wet and dry) My guys have been on Nutro but I’m needing to find something more affordable.

Online research has mixed reviews of everything I’ve found so I’m looking for personal experiences. Thanks!
,Money for Cheap Groceries in Immediate Need,"Good morning, lovely people. 

I am writing to see if I can get some assistance getting groceries. My best friend has been paying to keep a roof over my head, food in my gut, and my phone and insurance paid. That has left him with no money. Just to buy dog food and keep gas in his car for his work. 

I start work next week. I was supposed to start today but my background check hasn’t come through yet. 

I am now here asking for some assistance in the form of $40-$100 to buy food. He will be leaving town for a week and that leaves me with no resources to be able to feed myself. But we need something today and I need at least staples to make it through next week as well. (Plans to make it work until at least he had to leave have fallen through.) 

I can assure you that we are both very hard working people. If you check my post history you will see that I have asked for assistance in the past. Those posts are closed because I found a way to make some money. Right now I have no way of doing that. You will also see that pizza was gifted to me on Christmas Eve to celebrate the acquisition of my new position (the position for which I am still waiting for that background check to come back). 

I do desperately need your help. But things are definitely moving in an upward motion. 

Thank you so much for your attention and concern. And I look forward to paying it forward one day for someone in similar or worse circumstances.

ETA: Thanks to u/raphe1 I have created a Walmart wish list of solely food items that I could prepare multiple meals with over the course of the coming week. Thank you so much for your suggestion.

ETA(a): Thanks to u/seaboard2 for prompting me to add the list to the post. The copy of the list! 

Editing again: Thank you all so much for your support and assistance. I have created an amazon wishlist. I’ll be keeping an eye on it because I don’t know if it edits itself; if anyone confirms a purchase I’ll go remove it.

,Need months utilities paid.,"Please! We're still in need. We've been able to get food benefits, but there's been an issue getting my bank statements from my bank that only services the east coast. So, TANF and other benefits are kinda on hold until we can figure out how to resolve that issue.

My wife and I were finally able to achieve our dream of moving to Washington State. I had a job lined up. Unfortunately, when we were moving into our new place I fractured my leg. This has prevented me from working. My wife found a place to work in the time being, but the positions she can attain are nowhere near what I normally make. Therefore, we are drowning in bills.

I'm almost healed and about ready to get back to work. However, that money won't come soon enough.

I need to pay this months utilities, next months rent (due Jan. 1st), and part of next months utilities. 

I'm on the verge of tears just writing this. It's a terrible feeling to be in this position. I feel like I'm failing my family and I hate having to ask for money, but I see no other option as of this moment.

My wife and I have two children ages 3 and 1. 

I would be eternally grateful for any help received. 

In the future, when we are in a better position, we'll be sure to pay it forward especially this time of year.

Thanks for reading and God Bless!

,Medical Bills,"I only just found out about this subreddit, and I hope that I'm not out of line posting this here. I've already filled out the form.

I have $80,000 in medical bills, and I have no way to pay them. Anything would help <3

This is what I have written in the description on crowdfunding sites (that has gotten 0 donations):

I haven't had the best of lives, been bullied, parents hate each other, was forced to attend a cult-like church etc. I grew up in the Bible belt on the border of the Midwest and the South. My parents hate each other, always have. My mother is very religious, and has forced me and my brothers to go to her church growing up. They told us (but women in particular) what we could and could not wear. What we could not do, what we could not watch, where we couldn't go, and what we could not think. When I rebelled against this in my late teens, they shunned me, as typical of most cults. I was bullied in school because I was different.At first they didn't like my ignorance of the world (raised in a cult, wouldn't have known), then it was about this or that, just anything to make themselves feel better. I had very low self-worth. I was told to kill myself by people, was told I'd never be loved, hair pulled, kicked (although that was the extent of the physical aspect of it), the list goes on. The only person I could talk to about it was my half sister. In 2014, she passed away due to complications of her health. I didn't handle it well. It sent me on a downward spiral mentally.I was incorrectly diagnosed with Bipolar disorder in 2015. Finally, in 2016 I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Fast forward to December 2017. I've been going to therapy since July 2015 because my local counselling place has a program for people who don't have insurance. I wake up mid-December to news that someone I cared for deeply had committed suicide while I was sleeping. Again, I don't handle death well. I had so many things I was pushing away emotionally that their death opened the floodgates and everything came rushing in until I couldn't take it anymore.I downed all 6 bottles of prescription medication I was on for my mental health. Passed out within 10 minutes and woke up in the hospital a week later, hooked up to machines. I was in there for 2 weeks: ICU for 8 days, regular hospital room for 2 or 3 days, then I was transferred to the psychiatric unit for 3 more days.I've been doing pretty well since I was discharged, and I'm getting the help I need. But I still have the bills for the time I spent in the hospital and I have no way to pay for them. Please, if you can, help me pay these so a decision I made in the moment of emotional distress doesn't haunt me for the rest of my life.

TL;DR: I tried to kill myself and didn't have health insurance and cannot afford the bills"
,Toothpaste and cat food,"I know it’s a weird combo!

Anyway long story short, the company my husband worked for abruptly closed and he is having trouble finding a job.    Unemployment holds the first week, and I don’t get paid till Friday.   We are blessed that our food pantry in town can help and that we already paid our mortgage this month.   

Only thing we are lacking is toothpaste and cat food.    Cat does have dry food so I guess she’s be ok, she’s just used to eating canned food too..

I have never asked for help before but now I’m scared.  We live paycheck to paycheck and knowing there is not one coming from hubby’s job is terrifying me.   We can’t survive on just my paycheck, he made double what I did.   

Anyway I’m swallowing my pride and asking for assistance.  I have a wish list, I hope I linked it right.   Thank you if you can help,  if not thank you for reading and I know there’s much more people worse off than us so I understand.

,Would someone help me join the gym?,"Okay, so I was a fat kid growing up. My dad gave me a lot of shit for it. Like it was bad, he used to tell me to watch what I'm eating while I'm eating like that's not fair when I was like just 8-16.

I joined the gym in 2018, lost a lot of weight became fit. I got a 1 year membership and hit the gym everyday. I absolutely loved it, It in a way helped me with my mental health as well. I just felt good. It was a feeling I didn't get from anything else, I just loved beating myself up at the gym.
So fast forward, my membership ended in Sep 2019. We were in the worst of financial situations at that time and still are so I can't afford to get a yearly membership. So I didn't go to the gym for 2 months. In November,  I found an application which gave gym pass for a monthly rate which was way cheaper than what the gym's charge. 
It was 1280 INR per month. I bought a pass for a month. Hit regularly for a month. After the pass got over I didn't have money for another pass. I thought I'll be able to save up to get the pass by new year but I couldn't save the money as a first point and to add to this, the application removed the 1 month pass and now they only sell passes for 3,6,9 months.

The 3 month membership costs 4000 INR. Now there's a limited discount, don't know for how long and the price after discount is 2400 INR.

I love hitting the gym and it really helps me, I am currently going through a really tough time and if someone could get me this membership I would really be very thankful.

I do understand that not going to the gym is not the end of the world, I just thought I could just ask since the worst that could happen is no one helps and that's totally fine.

Have a great day!"
,Bellyband for Umbilical Hernia,"Hi everyone! I hope you’re all doing well, and your new year has been pretty good. I was just hoping I could possibly get some help with getting a Belly Band (I’m not sure if that’s what it’s called?). I’m currently 23 weeks pregnant, and have developed an umbilical hernia from the pressure my son is putting on my abdomen. I can’t even stand without extreme pain, that gets worse when I eat or stand for too long. Between bills, putting away for baby’s needs, the birth costs, etc, I don’t really have the extra income to buy one myself. I’m trying to get one through my insurance but the claim is taking an incredibly long time to go through. Thanks so much for reading, and I hope you have a good rest of your day!"

She is absolutely inconsolable..she's terrified that she won't have a place to home to when she goes into labor. The landlord wants a payment now. She has a settlement check that is due to be here at the end of January, this is what she was going to use to get caught up on her bills and live on till she can get back to work. But since the landlord has decided to leave out of state till April he has changed his mind and wants everything now and will not work with her. We have called everywhere..all the churches in the area..all the social agencies. I cannot get qualified for a loan due to how new I am at my job. She is backed into a corner..can anyone please help? Can provide proof of eviction notice if needed. Thank you everyone for listening..its very embarrassing to ask."

I really wanted to get her something for Christmas as soon as possible but it's too late for that though I still want to get her something.

,Need help with funding. Explained in post.,"Hey everyone.

I wouldn't normally make a post asking for things like this, it's not in my nature but I really need some help.I recently got off the streets after spending many years there. It was a real battle as many people saw little worth in helping a homeless person. The week I got off the streets I applied for college as I had become homeless before completing my GCSE's, the basic ones being free at my local college. I am now looking to take that education further (I am trying to prove to some charities and org's that homeless people can flourish and succeed if given a platform to work from, hopefully providing other people platform in the future so they don't hit the struggles I have) but sadly with my living circumstances I cannot afford the next course, I currently live in abject poverty and often go days without eating, I try to subsidise my funds by busking but as a lot of people know that's a very hit and miss approach to making money (I am looking for work but have been unsuccessful in my attempts due to a lack of qualifications and experience, was hard to attain experience while being homeless as most people do not employ homeless people for a variety of reasons). This leads me to my request for assistance. Is someone able to donate £250 for me to pay for this course (Its a programing and computer sciences course, it's a prerequisite to aeronautical engineering course I am hoping to do starting september or january).

I really really want to complete college and get into Uni by the time I am 30 (I am 28 and have been on and off the streets since I was 14, mainly on them) as I feel enough of my life has been wasted...

I totally understand if people do not want to assist here as it's a big ask and there are definitely people on this subreddit who are in difficult situations who could also do with the assistance, but either way thank you all for reading <3"

I had hip surgery recently as well which just makes everything 10x better 🙄 anyways, doc wrote me some Antibiotics and an inhaler. With my insurance the inhaler is $50+tax. I have been unemployed because of the hip surgery so we’re really really screwed on our bills. I’m down to 10 puffs on my inhaler and I’ve been using it daily. I don’t know where else to go.

,Help get my pets medicine+general bill help,"**A note: All of the animals have already seen a vet and been diagnosed! It is** ***definitely*** **tapeworms, I just need money to continue their treatment!**

&#x200B;

So, some time in...October I believe, my sister brought home a stray cat that had a horrible flea infestation. We've been doing our best to handle it (it's just barely getting under control) but because of it, the cat had tapeworms, and despite our best efforts, it's spread to the other cats, and now the dogs. I've treated all of them multiple times for both fleas, tapeworms, and general parasites, including pet visits for each one to see what specific parasite they had, in case it wasn't tapeworms, or JUST tapeworms.

So far it's cost upwards of $270+ total for all the animals (3 cats and 4 dogs) and eaten through all my savings. Another round of medicine for all of them will cost **$78.50**, and on top of that I still have to get money for the monthly bills ( **$210** ) and at least 2 of the animals (1 cat and 1 dog) are showing noticeable signs of decline despite everything we've been doing. I've never had an issue before where a flea and/or parasite infestation has been so difficult to get rid of and to be honest I'm just at my wit's end.

Any sort of donations, no matter how small is appreciated. I'll update this post with any money raised and such of course to keep up with how much is still needed/etc.

&#x200B;

# Update:

My dad begrudgingly said he'll pay his part for the medicines for his animals so I only need $56 for the medicines now! I still need $210 for bills but it's still a lot less than what I needed before :)

&#x200B;

# 2nd Update:

A person off-site generously donated the money I needed to get the medicine for my pets! While I still need money for bills, I am going to mark this as fulfilled because it's no longer a life or death situation. Help is still appreciated but no longer absolutely required!"
,Would anybody like a small (watercolour) painting done for them?,"I recently started painting again after a 10 year break. My skills have lapsed a little in that time and I'm also very uninspired as to what to paint, so I was wondering if anybody would like a picture done for them? I've been trying to paint at least two pictures a week just for practice, but thought if I paint something somebody else could enjoy it would feel more productive. 

 I have recently been painting horses, animals, dancers, but I can try my hand at people. I can try to adapt to different styles if you would like, some are watercolour with ink detail, pastel, charcoal etc. Here are a handful of recent small paintings and sketches https://imgur.com/a/LsF9ZcE 
 
 I'm happy to try unusual and humorous requests but nothing really rude (sorry). If the picture turns out well I can probably post it to you at my own expense but it will be sent via the cheapest mailing option, so if you're outside the UK I can't guarantee anything will arrive quickly. I prefer an image to work from, but I'm happy to change bits for you, change style, change background etc. You can show me similar paintings in the style you want and I'll do my best (no promises as I'm learning). Please keep in mind that I do this in my free time and paintings require drying between layers, so I can't promise to have something finished instantly.

Edit: I've had lots of replies, I'm hoping to manage to get round to everybody eventually!"

,Need help getting about $400 for the winter,"Trying to stay positive and also to not feel so bad that I do need help and knowing with help of a kind person’s words that it is ok to be in a bad spot, and it’s ok regardless of what others say to be down on my luck needing a leg up and to ask for help. ( thank you to that person, I was very much listening) so after some time thinking I have now posted this, things have not gotten better and I am trying to hold hope. 

To the point, I been in a bad spot for awhile now , having a hard time getting work and have lived off of my credit which is totally shot now from me and helping my grandmother and uncle and family as both died in 2018. I have done some odds and ends and sold all I can leaving only a couple things on eBay one of which is my grandfather’s antique flag which seems my price is too much and hard to find buyers I need to come up with a little over $400 for  for the winter, and other immediate things,  and I have a Gofundme on another sub for a less  immediate thing at the moment.I can not get a loan as well I’m being sued from just about all my credit cards, I can’t use the borrow sub here as who wants to lend money to someone without the promise of repayment. My family is limited and have nothing to help. I have been doing surveys and signup for pays but that’s not cutting it however does help with small things. I was unable to get unemployment, disability gave me a run around for my issues. So lol I’m just up the Creek and really need a paddle. I have no friends no social media and have posted my gofundme on a sub here but that has gone no where.  

I try, but know it is not very hopeful to get anywhere.( but trying to stay positive ) If you want to sit here and tell me to get a job...I’m trying, if you want to belittle me for being out of work so long then please just move on, I really have had enough of comments telling me I’m wrong for being in a bad spot, really don’t need it.

,My agoraphobia/anxiety is going to leave me homeless,"Long story short: at 14 I developed severe anxiety due to daily abuse, which lasted about 2 years (the abuse). I was an alcoholic by 16 to cope. From 16 - 19 I lived in a constant ""buzzed"" state. At 19 I had a rock bottom moment with alcohol which resulted in complete social isolation (few friends I had decided I was a lost cause) and made me realize alcohol was only prolonging my hurt. Problem was, coming off booze after 3 years of having it daily brought the anxiety back ten-fold. I'm 27 now (as of today. It's my birthday), and I live in a constant state of fight or flight if I take a single step outside my door. I'm petrified of crowds. Of strangers. Of any twist or turn in the road because I don't know what's around the corner.

I've reached out for help a handful of times when it comes to my mental health. I've been stuck on anti-depressants by apathetic GPS and given beta-blockers by others. Nothing has helped. I was sent to a social worker (not a therapist) despite pleading for a therapist. Then I had to sit and listen as this unqualified man (when it comes to mental health) basically told me to ""get over"" it. I saw him a total of 3 times over 3 weeks, and I'd spend the night before seeing him planning out my route/crying/trying to justify canceling. Unfortunately, he made it easy when he told me to stop talking about my past abuse.

Each time I reached out for help, it took planning. It took days of staring at the phone. Hours of hesitation each time. And it's gotten me nowhere. If anything, it only makes me isolate myself even more (negative social interactions pretty much leave me housebound for months at a time) One of the biggest issues i have is convincing doctors of how bad this is. They treat me as if i've just stumbled into their office and decided I have anxiety that morning. They don't seem to understand that my being there takes years worth of rapidly depleting courage.

I've been getting by for years through self-employment. I've been determined to make a living from within the walls of wherever i'm living instead of fixing my mental state - because that seems hopeless. Problem is, I'm not getting as much work anymore, and now I can barely make rent. Very barely. I'm one payment away from having the lights shut off.

I would honestly love to go out and get a normal job. I'm so lonely. Incredibly isolated. I feel like I've not matured much as a person since my early 20s (now late 20s) because I've not had the opportunity to. I feel like I'm wasting away. But i can't find help. And whenever I seem to be making progress, I cancel at the last second because it's honestly SO hard to leave that door somedays.

I've considered the idea of going on disability for a while if what I have is considered a disability? Problem is, I imagine there's all sorts of meetings and stuff to attend, which is (obviously) something i'm not comfortable with. I even thought about registering as unemployed and getting those standards benefits to help out.. but the bi-weekly meetings, and then actually getting and going to a job I wont have a panic attack at? I'd be a wreck. I can't even step into a store, let alone work in one. I just don't know what to do. I'm fine in the house, but if I run out of pepsi and want more that day, i have to wait till my next food delivery because going to the store around the corner isn't an option - it's that bad. I've cried myself into the fetal position several times after working up the courage to put the key in the lock, then not being able to turn it.

I wish I was exaggerating.

I think the reason this has all gotten so bad - mentally and financially - is because i've just been in denial. I've just been playing video games, obsessing over my weight, focusing on stuff that really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things because I didn't want to face it. Now i have to. I have no idea what to do. and, clearly, being less than 20 days away from having no money, with absolutely no help available to me, is taking its toll. Honestly, it's a wonder i've got by for as long as I have.

I'm in the UK btw. Healthcare systems around the world are surely quite different. So i'm not sure any advice outside of the UK can help when it comes to the technical stuff.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I have no long-term solutions. I feel hopeless most days.  I'm only turning here because I have no other options available to me. It's 6:42 am and I haven't been able to sleep because I'm just so worried about everything now. I don't know how this sub works, but if anyone at all can help me get by I would appreciate it more than words can express. I know i need to figure something longterm out. I know. But I just need time.

__Final total: £123.09 or $231.66 AUD__

[Email receipt and transaction](https://imgur.com/gallery/quOP1ci)

OP:

__1 comment = £0.5 (GBP) donation to NSW Rural Fire service__ *

I’m sure there are people here who would like to donate to the Australian wild fire crisis but are unable to spare any cash. I have some spare money after taking out what I will donate personally. 

Therefore I am empowering you with a simple comment, as asking for upvotes is kinda shady. Your comment can be anything - but I really like dadjokes and Spongebob. 

My sister lives in Australia with her husband and 2 children, so I feel an emotional tie to the country. Along with the fact that millions of animals have died, a huge ecosystem has perished and humans are being killed/injured. 

Disclaimer: Limitations to how much I can donate, currently on long term sickness leave for the past 14 weeks, but I will upload proof - I’ll get a receipt. Let’s go with a £50 limit. 

*I am not wealthy

Edit: Thank you so much for the response so far! I appreciate all of your very kind words but don’t feel like you have to be so nice to me. Just to be clear - that’s not what I’m doing this for!

Edit 2: As of 8:30 GMT we have 210 comments - my 14 replies is 196. 196*50p = £98. I’d like to thank everyone who contributed, including one word comments. I didn’t ask for jokes, I included that as a funny off topic idea, I read all of them when I woke up just now and they’re brilliant! Thanks for all of your time, it’s really great to get this awesome sub talking about one of the many important current issues. I set the £50 limit but actually I’m going to disregard that and go with the £98 because you guys are awesome. I set aside £25 personally so I will include this to make £123. (One donation=one conversion fee). Be back for edit 3 with a screenshot.

Edit 3: Thank you so much to everyone that continues to comment. I read and upvote all, you make my day! Having never redacted a screenshot that will go public before, I decided to go all in.. apologies. 

To anyone who thinks I have ill karma farming narcissist intentions, sorry that you think that. I genuinely set aside £25 of my own money to donate and had £50 spare after bills. I don’t need to justify what I spend my money on, but I’d probably have used this £50 on general household items I want. Instead I’ll buy that stuff next month. I decided I just won’t have takeaway for a couple of weeks and that’s the extra £50. 

Donated to NSW generally, thanks to the user who suggested a specific brigade but I decided I’m not the best person to decide where this money should go. Instead I left it to them. 

Thanks also to the user who suggested Victoria, sadly they didn’t accept credit card. I hope you keep yourself and family safe. 

To anyone living in Australia, or with family in Australia, I hope you stay safe. Follow the alerts and information.

,Impounded car racking up daily tow yard fees,"Hello my car got towed 8 days ago when I was pulled over because my back tire had a wobble to it. Now it was wobbling because I broke two lug studs off putting tires on the car and had literally jus baught new lug studs when the cop pulled me over and was 1/4 mile from where I could install them but back to my story I ended up having a suspended license from a ticket I had recieved a couple years ago and forgot all about because of some things that happened at the same time, so I spent only 6 hours in jail before I was released only to find out they had already towed my car(I thought they gave a couple of days) and this was a Friday morning when I was pulled over so when I call about getting my car back I am told i can't do anything until the fallowing Monday when the office is open. So Monday comes and I call first thing only to be told it was $235.00 to tow my car the 5 miles from where I was arrested to the tow service storage yard and not only that but it is $35 every day it sits in the tow yard which started the Friday it got towed. I already was at $295.00 dollars owed and this was the first time I could even speak to someone about getting my car. Well I attempt to make a living building wood furniture and spend the rest of my time taking care of my grandparents so I didn't have $300 so now 9 days later my car which I need not only for my woodworking business but also to aid me in taking care of my grandparents is stuck inside of a tow yard racking up $35 dollars each day  and getting more and more out of reach with each new day. I desperately need help getting my car out of this tow yard before I lose it for good due to the $35 a day charge and all of this because I had a slight tire wobble that I had jus baught the parts to fix and was on my way to do so.

Edit: I got housed on Halloween of 2019. I went from sleeping outside, to a shelter, to a house with a stove and a shower and a yard.  I lost my job 3 days ago because of my citizenship status. The owner wants non english speaking citizens. Preferably illegals. These are his words not mine.  My last paycheck was almost enough to cover everything listed above.... actually......yes it would have covered all that. Paycheck was cashed on my person (in my bag) along with my phone which was only 2 months old, my EBT card and my brand new CDL that I JUST got in the mail the day before and 2 or 3 food items.  Not one but two young men not a day over 25 decided to behave in the weakest pussiest way and rob me. 2 young men in their prime as strong as they are ever going to be should have knocked my ass out floored me took my bag and vanished. Im a girl.  Im not a trained fighter. Its possible I was the first person they ever robbed because I fought with these  sissies for at least 8 to 11 minutes. I defended myself and held onto my bag as long as I could but they got it in the end. The street was lined with RV's and nobody came out.  One of them kept using a taser but it was barely charged so it didnt do anything except irrittate me a little. I digress, there is a rich history behind this year and the years before...but this incident has mutated into a tightrope of despair that becomes more unstable with every passing hour.

,Sick and disabled. Need help,"I am on disability for a severe back injury.

A growth was found in my stomach. I was given a referral to a nearby hospital for further testing to determine if this growth is cancerous or something less nefarious. Unfortunately,I am married to a very abusive and unsupportive man. I have already rescheduled this procedure twice because the man I married refused to take me or help pay for an Uber.

,"Still in need of co-pay money, born with rare genetic bone disorder.","[Here's my original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/ec7r4d/requesting_30_for_specialist_copay_born_with_rare/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

I won't go into it all again, it's a lot to write. Basically, I was born with a rare genetic bone disorder, affecting 1-2% of the population. It causes non-cancerous tumors to grow on my limbs (that do have the chance of becoming cancerous eventually,) and they can affect my mobility. Last week, I was on a cane for 2 days, because every time I stepped down my left leg, it felt like someone was stabbing me.

It's perfectly normal, for my case.

Anyways, I scheduled an appointment for January 13th. I don't have the co-pay money, and I really don't want to put it on my credit card. (Which will take me a couple of months to pay off. So anything would help.)

To make it all worse, I now need an eye doctor co-pay ($30) and another doctor copay ($15) both of those I'm hoping to be able to pay on my own somehow. I will have $60-$75 (depending on if I need another seperate doctor's appointment) worth of co-pays alone.

The bone doctor though, is currently my biggest priority. My astigmatism, ocular migraines, and slight shortness of breath may have to wait... 😂

The $30 going to my bone doctor can get me x-rays, meds, supplements, and maybe even on a waiting list for a surgery to remove the exotoses/tumors that are causing me pain. I'm going to this appointment no matter what- but being able to pay as most of it off as I can while I'm there would be a huge help.


In any case, thank you for reading the hectic mess that is my life. Absolutely anything helps, even a kind acknowledging upvote. Thank you!

Oh, and an edit: I noticed on my last post, I got a fine amount of downvotes (which could have been bots) and I get it. If anyone needs proof I have this bone disease, then I would happily send something your way to back this up. It's hereditary in my family. My mom has it. I'm just the family's current worst case scenario of it. The only other person in my family who has it almost as bad as I do is my uncle, and it's supposed to affect males worse. Still. I'd be happy to provide proof, and even a doctor's statement on the hereditary part. :)"

,Waiting for my mom to become homeless (Canada BC),"It’s quite complicated, but my mom is 61 with severe mental illness. She is separated from my dad, she lives off his 1500 per month alimony along with 600 disability payment. Her rent is 1600 a month, and she doesn’t want to move. The problem is, my dad could retire in 5 years or 1 month, we don’t know, and once that happens she will not get alimony anymore. She will get half his pension maybe 400 a month.  
My mom sleeps all day and watches TV all night, her severe anxiety and depression caused her to not take care of herself for the last 5 years. She has fallen down outside a few years ago and almost died of hyperthermia. She has fallen down her stairs the last year and has two compression fractures now. She obviously doesn’t drive, but she also doesn’t want to do anything for herself ever. She expects me and her sister to do everything for her forever. The big problem—-her mental illness and her using me as her therapist for the last decade has destroyed me. I have been diagnosed with PTSD from my own mother. She’s a nice lady, she loves me, but she’s so manipulative and selfish. I’m 28 with a 2 year old and soon to be pregnant. Being around her makes me mentally and physically ill. Driving her to appointments is like pure hell, because just looking at her is incredibly hard. I have done hours and hours of research for low income housing, seniors care, assisted living you name it. And she won’t listen, she thinks everything will just work out. She doesn’t understand how bad her situation is. I’ve told her so many times and tried so hard to help but now she’s affecting my health so badly it’s effecting how I take care of my family so I can’t help her anymore. I’ve spoken to my doctor, who has been her doctor for 25 years as well and he completely agrees with me, I need keep my boundaries. I know people will judge me for this, but I will never ever have her live with me no matter what. And my siblings are disabled and definitely unable to help in anyway. 
I have told the doctor she needs a social worker. I have to let the system take care of her now, which is heartbreaking because I don’t know where she will end up. I’m just hoping a social worker or mental health can help her find a home she can afford...I really think she needs to be in assisted living but not sure if she will qualify. It’s all too much for me and I need to stop. I just wanted to vent this out, I have no one to talk to, my boyfriend just doesn’t understand he doesn’t want me to be around my mom at all because he sees how it ruins me. I hope there is some kind of help for seniors with mental and now physical illness who need a home."

,Small Business Owner needs Children's / Parents input for Creative Project,"Hi guys,

I'm a small business owner and I have been creating a card game called Unicorn Robot Party.  The game is designed to be printable with the intention of selling it as a digital product on Etsy but I'm looking at making a properly printed version as well through the website The Game Crafter.  

&#x200B;

**What I need help with**

What I am looking for is for teens over the age of 13 or parents of children of any age to complete my survey which is intended to capture children's and teens responses to various scenarios: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DMZX8T7](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DMZX8T7)

It can be completed with or without providing an email, but if you provide an email, when the base game of Unicorn Robot Party is complete you will receive a free copy of the printable version of the Base Game.  

&#x200B;

**Some Background**

Unicorn Robot Party is a game aimed at adults that has a character and concept call Kid AI in it.  The game benefits from children's input in the same way Axe Cop benefitted from having a child involved in creating the stories or how Jimmy Fallon's Kid Theatre benefits from having children's input involved. The Base Game is getting closer and closer to being complete other than art but I need more input for the Kid AI aspect of the game.

&#x200B;

**The Scenarios in the Survey**

I am seeking children's responses to the following scenarios (can be paraphrased):

1. A group of adventurers are standing in a doorway looking into a room.  Tell me what the room looks like and what the adventurers can see in the room.  

2. You are on an adventure.  You find something that can help you with your adventure.  If you could find anything to help you with your adventure, what would it be?  What does it do?  What does it look like?  

3. Pretend you are really powerful and can do anything, including magic.  Someone else made you angry.  Would you forgive them for making you angry?  If not, since you can do anything, what would you do?

&#x200B;

Thank you for your help.  I really appreciate it.

Nor have I been able to care for myself since not having the car since October I have missed so many appointments that it’s going to take me a month or more of appointments to catch up. Please if you can spare a few bucks I promise I’ll pay it forward when I’m on my feet and caught up medically. Going through my insurance isn’t an option because I only had the state minimum liability when I got the car I forgot to go over my coverage with my insurance company.

,Paycheck was less than expected... really need some help to get through the next 2 weeks,"Hello everyone, 

I feel embarrassed to even have to ask for help because that’s not me.. but here I am. I’m a stay at home mom while my husband works. We have an infant son and daycare is rather expensive here (800/month if potty trained and $850 if not) is the cheapest I’ve found in our area. We’ve came to the conclusion that it’s just cheaper for me to watch our son rather than going to work and paying for child care. 

That being said, my husband’s paycheck was smaller than what we expected it to be. After rent is paid, phone bill and car payment, we’re left with $11. I already called my bank for my car payment to see if they’d do a deferred payment and unfortunately they won’t. They said that they only offer it twice a year - once in the winter for the holidays and once in the summer. 

I’ve placed together an Amazon wishlist with food items, toiletries and some baby formula and diapers if anyone would like to help.

I am back to work now, but my first check on the 10th will only be two days. I have a beautiful, smart, and kinds little girl who is wanting a birthday party and I just don't see how I am going to be able to do this for her. Her birthday is on the 15th and I feel guilty because I have always done a day for her and her friends, but this year i just don't know what I will do. I have a cake we can make and some candles, but am unable to get her any decorations or a present. In years past, if I was in a tough spot, my mom would have helped me, but since she passed away a couple years ago I don't have anyone else to ask for help. Anything you are able to do would be awesome. Just to be able to give her something. She is always so kind and giving to others I just want to give her a great day.

,Advice for a stressed out mom (son has medical issue),"Hello all!
 
Long story short, I’m just looking for any advice on how to help my situation after having to take a temporary leave of absence from work due to a child’s medical condition. 

Background:
I am a teacher at a private school  and my husband works as a teachers aide. Unfortunately, I wrongfully assumed it would be easy to find a better paying job out of college and have no savings whatsoever. (I love teaching but private school pay can be so terrible). 

Anyways, I have two beautiful children, one of which was born this March. On the day we were supposed to be discharged from the hospital he ended up being transported to the NICU and months later was diagnosed with aspiration  (liquid goes to his lungs) and was put on a feeding tube. At this point, my husband and I decided that I needed to take a year off teaching to stay home with my son. The cost of daycare is more than I take home a month and most places would not take him with a feeding tube. 

With no savings and no job, we are struggling badly at the moment. We are months behind of just about all bills. It becomes hard to buy groceries or gas for the car. Thankfully we do qualify for some resources such as WIC and fuel assistance, but I haven’t been able to find any financial assistance. I do not want to lose my house (I cry often fearing that this will become a reality and what it would mean for the kids) and can’t stand the thought of not being able to feed them. 

My situation is temporary as I will go back to work when his medical situation is clear (doctors are hopeful by the end of the year or before) but it will take so long to recover financially. I’m just looking for advice on what I can do to help my family. Right now my husband is working his aide job as well as a second job right after. Are there Legit work from home companies? Or how would you handle finances in this situation? 

If you’ve read this far, thank you!!"

,Need Help with Doctor Bill (partial)for Biopsy,"I understand that this is last minute, so I don't expect a miracle. I was hoping to come up with the money on my own by selling some of my belongings but I've had zero luck.

Tomorrow at 1:30 Pm EST, I have a cervical biopsy appointment. I missed my last 3 that were scheduled due to lack of transportation (no money for Uber or bus and too far to walk). I got charged $50 for each missed appointment but they've agreed to accept a partial payment of the $150 and are only asking for a 3rd of it at a time. I'm a new patient so they have the 3 strikes and you're out kinda attitude. This time I do have Uber money in my Uber account but that's all I have. .43 cents in my bank account.. Which I'm willing to show you.

I don't like asking for help and usually find a way to make it work but I don't have friends or family able to help. I'm 2 years late for this biopsy and have had cancerous cells for over 12 years so now my fear is that I'm gonna have really bad news. 

I know many people are broke after Christmas but I also am out of work for the last 4 months and have 4 kids. I can't even sleep.

I just can't walk in there empty handed. Maybe even $20 will appease them, idk. On the bright side, I also have a job interview tomorrow night within walking distance of my home, so maybe things will start going well.

I feel ashamed as I'm usually the one giving and not taking. If I had known my company was going to go out of business, I wouldn't have bought a couch or anything when I moved or been so extravagant with my kids gifts that I bought for Christmas months in advance and I'd be all set today. Lesson learned with that one.

End of rant. Thanks if you even read this. I hope it made sense. I feel like I've been up for days.


Edit: My appointment was rescheduled due to the Doctor having not one but two of her patients go into labor today. They said they will get me.in with whatever doctor is available in the next 2 weeks. So on, continues the stress. Off to my interview, may the force be with me."

,Update to Halfway There with an Interview Tomorrow but No Gas or Food,"Please Read Update at bottom

I posted here yesterday saying how wonderful everyone is and to ask for help one more time. My husband has a job interview tomorrow and we have no gas to get there. It's about five miles away and I don't want him to walk. We live in the Pacific Northwest so it's cold as balls and it snowed. They don't plow the sidewalks. I'm also asking for some help with food, specifically diary. I begged for milk, butter, and cheese at the food bank last week and they didn't give us any. We have many things we can make if we had milk. Hell I'll buy powdered milk so it lasts longer. There's just one problem we have before we can receive help.

Our account is -$50 and we have no other account to use. I had a friend come to town today because she said we could use hers, but she backed out saying she doesn't trust strangers with her info. So instead of asking for $20 for gas to last a pay period and $20-$30 for some food, I have to ask for around $100. I hate myself for asking for such an amount, but we have no one else to turn to. It's just us. 

Let me just say sorry now and I don't expect much. I'm just desperate and asking for help.

Update: We have $50 out of the $100! You guys are amazing! Someone also suggested to talk to the bank to see if we can get the overdraft fee waived at the bank. We will be trying our luck tomorrow when they open. I'll keep you guys updated."

I am a 25 Y/O FTM trans, I usually am not a person to ever ask for help, I'm one of the people usually helping out and this is kinda a hard thing for me to do but I have come here to hopefully get some assistance. (I've tried to sign up where you can receive one as a donation but it's been years of waiting)

I have been fighting for my transition since I was around 13 (when I first came out) and it's been one hell of a ride, I've pretty much been disowned by everyone I used to be close to, loosing multiple jobs due to people not being understanding at all nor seeing me as a hard working person instead they see a broken person who is mentally unstable due to me being trans. I've then also had issues with finding work due to my depression, anxiety and dysphoria getting In my head due to previous employment.

my dysphoria, depression and anxiety have really been kicking in and I really am on the edge of just giving up on everything, I've been doing all I can to try and help even going to psychologists and seeking out advice but it's all came back to really needing help to get a binder as there is no other way to treat it other than surgery and it's going to be a long time until I can do that. For the sake my mental health, my body and mind, topass more and give me a push I really need in the right direction.

I remember people being upset that I picked a private university, so let me explain why: I have many health conditions that prevent me from plenty of jobs, so there wasn't much to chose from. The second Problem was that the one thing I wanted, just wasn't avaiable anywhere else (Communication Design) to a degree that this university offers as well as being approved by the state.

,Looking for a leg up.,"I have been looking for non-profits and such, but it seems most of them are geared toward the worst of the worst cases and/or have extreme waiting lists.

My story: I moved from Texas to Tennessee after getting a job at UT Medical Center. After several instances of sexual harassment, I reported it but had to leave. The position the person held was in management of the Transportation department, which is all over the hospital. I felt like certain people in that dept may retaliate against me. This dept. had previously covered up an assault on a fellow coworker, and after that I did not feel safe.

I do have a job lined up at FedEx in Memphis that pays 14.08/hr as a Material Handler, I was told by the HR Manager I have the job as long as I have a clean background (which I do, as I just got out of the Military), and that as soon as it comes back he will officially offer me the job.

I need to move to somewhere close, I have located a place in nearby Brownsville (only about an hour drive from FedEx)  (99$ first months rent) and 375$ a month which is doable for me. However, due to not working lately, I do not have a ton of money to move into the apartment. (I basically have just enough to cover the first months rent of 99).

I am hoping someone may can help with this or can point me to a non-profit organization that is more able to help people that aren't as serious as others. My other option would be to sleep in my car, until I can get a paycheck under my belt.

I am seeking to get about $600 to be on the safe side.

I will gladly provide any information requested.

Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

Good evening dear Redditors,

I come to you to ask for help with groceries and bus fares to get me around for the next two weeks.  
Because of medical reasons (my circulation is super weak at the moment, sometimes I can't leave the house because of this), my funds are rapidly running out. I hate it, and I try to get better and force myself to go and get groceries instead of ordering stuff (which is more expensive) but right now I have more bad days than good ones. It feels so humiliating to be stuck in my own home.

I have PayPal and I'd need around 30-40 dollars for the time. But I'd appreciate anything people can offer until I get a decision from the unemployment agency here for my benefits. I'm trying to get money by selling stuff I don't need urgently, but I can't force anybody to buy my things...

Thank you in advance."

,Non-monetary request: Homeless and surviving the Chicago winter just got harder...,"I [live in](https://imgur.com/PLqaQbl) an abandoned building with no utilities or furniture. Recently my sleeping pad [delaminated and deformed](https://imgur.com/HqZNSfY). If you are unfamiliar with outdoor gear, sleeping pads insulate from the bottom and sleeping bags insulate your top and sides. You can't use a sleeping bag alone in the winter. So I have no choice but to sleep on it with that lump in the middle.

Below is an amazon wish list that includes a sleeping pad. Also toiletries and such if you can't give that much. Feel free to recommend cheaper alternatives I could add to the list. Since running out of q-tips, I injured my ear trying to clean it otherwise, causing a period of vertigo when I would lay down. You're a saint if you can spare a few bucks for that.

If you're in the north Chicago area I could use a foam mattress instead of a sleeping pad, I just wouldn't be able to take it with me when I have to leave this building. I can also use bedding to insulate my tent, though that can't replace a sleeping pad or mattress. Toiletries and non perishable food would also be very helpful. 

I have a storage unit **near** (so as not to violate rules about specific location) Harlem and Lawrence for public meeting. Drive in building so you can avoid the cold.

,Help with medical care for dog attacked by other dogs,"My neighbors dog was attacked by another dog on their walk. This is their story.

""This attack actually happened on Friday, 12/27. Around 9:50pm I was walking our two smallest dogs in the alleyway behind our house when two dogs came around the corner from the intersecting alley and ran right at ours. 

I remember seeing a leash lying on the ground, unattached to anything, which tells me their owner was walking them unleashed and just carrying a leash with him. The attacking dogs were a light brown color and medium-sized, maybe 50 lbs. each, but much larger than our two, who are between 10-20 lbs. The larger of ours escaped with just a scratch, but the smaller, a 10-lb. Chihuahua & terrier mix named Cinnamon, got serious damage, probably because she has more fight in her nature (unfortunate, given her size). 

She incurred several punctures and lacerations across nearly half her body. Cinnamon went in for emergency surgery that night and came home to start her recovery. She was doing OK until last Thursday, when she suddenly didn't want to eat or drink, and her wounds began oozing blood and pus. She went back to the vet and they determined that the wound was infected and performed another surgery to remove a mass of dead tissue. 

This second surgery cost significantly more than the first and our total vet bills are well over $2000 now. I regret that I didn't get information from the other owner at the time, and thus I hold onto little hope of ever getting restitution from him. I was trying to get our dogs back home ASAP while he was still regaining control of his.""

You can see on that page a photo of how Cinnamon looked the day after the first surgery. Any little bit helps and is wholeheartedly appreciated by this neighbor. [go fund me](http://gf.me/u/w92xvr)"

,"[Services request] It's 2020 and I haven't seen my brother in 10 years, help me find him?","I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, if anyone has any ideas of better or more helpful subs please redirect me. 

I have not seen my older brother in about 10 years now. I miss him greatly; I cry every time I think about him. Sometimes I scour the internet searching his name, just to see if anything comes up. He just disappeared from my and my family's life one day, left his house, stopped responding to his phone or any email addresses. He didn't say goodbye or anything.  We have very little family, and our family is pretty messed up. My brother and I were close and we could only talk to each other about how messed up the family is. I don't think he wanted to hurt ME, I think he wanted to get away from our father and stepmother. The two of us never had a falling out of any kind, never fought or hurt each other. We dealt with our depression and mental illness(es) in very different ways at that time. Maybe he felt like I couldn't understand him. 

I suspect that he WANTED to disappear, and I understand that and I want to respect him and his space and desire to be out of my life if he wants that. But I just worry so much about him. I suspect he's had an alcohol or drug issue. I picture him homeless or on the street or something and my heart breaks. 

I just want to know he's okay and reach out to him and send my love. My mother is dead and I'm not close to my father, so I feel like he is all I have and I may never see him again for the rest of my life and I just don't know how to handle that. 

Please if anyone has any advice or is willing to offer any services that could be useful. I may have to share information about him if it's a PI so it has to be someone professional who won't take advantage. 

How can I find someone I love who is just gone?"

,my drunk friend (18m) touched me (17f) while i was asleep,"okay so im going to try my best to explain the story without it being really long. basically myself and a couple friends decided to drink and chill at our other friends house who we will call Joe. i had only met joe a few times and even though we had barely been friends for a few weeks we clicked as friends quickly, and i also trusted him because my friend was good friends with him. after we got to joe's house we started drinking and i got to a point where i was pretty buzzed but not super drunk or anythiing. joe and my other friend were pretty buzzed aswell. joe asked me for a back massage and i told him i wasnt good at them but that i'd try anyways. after a bit we all started giving hickies to eachother just as a fun thing and i thought everything was still lighthearted and playful because we were all friends. well i think joe may have gotten the wrong impression from me and started being more touchy with me but i just ignored it and eventually joe and my other friend fell asleep, leaving only me n my other friend awake. it was like 5 at this point and i decided to go to sleep and the only space left was next to joe on his bed. i said fuck it and went to sleep next to joe since i was super tired. well i fell asleep for a bit and woke up feeling half asleep to joe touching my boobs and trying to finger me. i didnt know what to do so i froze and pretended that i was still asleep but i moved as if i was shifting in my sleep to get away from him but so he would still think i was asleep. i fell asleep again for a few hours and woke up to the same thing but this time i knew it was actually morning because our alarm went on just minutes after he did it to me again. the second time he did it really shocked me and now that part is starting to feel like a hallucination because at that point it was morning and he was sober (not that being drunk is an excuse for it AT ALL). i pretended like nothing happened and went home. i told my friend who was there and whos good friends with him about everything and we both ended up confronting him about it over text. he was very apologetic and felt horrible about it and said he didnt even remember anything like that. not really sure where to go from here, everything feels super awkward now and uncomfortable. im starting to feel somewhat to blame because of the drinking and hickies, im not sure how to feel anymore. literally any advice would help, thanks.

,I really need help I don’t know what to do,"Crossposted but I feel so overwhelmed and really need help :(


It’s the sad familiar story of girl falls in love and trusts the person 100% only to get totally screwed over in the end. 

In 2018 I (29 female) bought (against my better judgement and persuasion by my then fiancé) a condo in Connecticut. I bought the place for $99,000 with little money down. The mortgage payment each month is $788.91 and to make matters worse that includes a HOA of $280.41 a month, I believe at the moment my loan is about $96,000

And here’s my big problem. I had to move back home (in New York) after a mental health emergency where I was in treatment for a good few months. My ex was nice enough to rent the condo from me this year but has since decided to hate me and tell me I’m “on my own”. Unfortunately we broke up due to him being controlling, and unfaithful but that means nothing when it comes to finances and what is legal. That condo is mine and I am stuck having no idea what to do. 

I now live in New York because going back to that state would most likely kill me. I’ve taken moves to try to get it sold. It’s currently on the market and I’m working with a realtor. And unfortunately it only has been for about three weeks because previously my ex told me he would rent another year and then changed his mind just last month. I have a few showings a week but hope it will pick up now that the holidays are over. My biggest problem is I have no way to pay once February 1st comes along. I live in another state, I pay rent for an apartment here, and have picked up my life and started over with a great job and supportive family and friends. I can’t go back to CT. 

If I can’t sell this house by the end of the month I’m not sure what my options are and this is where I’m looking for advice. I know the possibility of foreclosure and filing for bankruptcy are very high. I want to know just how bad that will effect my life. Are there any other options? (aside from moving back to CT which isn’t possible) People have told me to rent it out but being a landlord from another state is almost impossible as well. It was different when I knew my ex and knew he wouldn’t destroy the place. Can I even rent while it’s on the market? 

I’m afraid, terrified actually. A lot of days I feel like there is no other way out then just ending it all. My mental health has suffered drastically and I feel like I’m right back to where I was this time last year. Its Sunday and I’m still in bed and I have no plans of getting up because I can’t even will myself to do it. I feel entirely lost and don’t know how to deal with any of this

I’m sorry if this was a lot but I wanted to provide background. I really hope someone can shed some light or give me some much needed advice

,Homeless and Need Money to Rent a Car," Edit: It looks like I'm getting a lot of down votes and I'm not sure why. I'm sorry if I said something wrong in this post, but I really am homeless and in need of a rental car. My mother can make up to $200 a day just doing deliveries, so having the use of a car would help a lot.

 Three and a half months ago, CPS wrongfully took my brother and left me and my mother homeless and with barely enough income to book a cheap motel each night (both our jobs involved caring for him).  We recently lost the rental car my mother needs to work and have been without shelter for a week now.

We need about $500 to pay for the deposit and rent a car for a week so my mother can uber and doordash. Before my mother was paying almost $500 a week to rent a car, but she was able to find something that would only cost her about $200 a week. If we can rent a car for this price, we'll finally be able to save money to get an apartment so we can get my brother back.

If anyone is willing to donate you can ask for my paypal or cash app through dm.
I also have a general gofundme to try and collect money for an apartment and permanent car. It also contains more info as to why we're homeless and what has been happening. But right now renting a car takes priority. https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-get-a-home-so-we-can-get-my-brother-back

Note: We are trying to apply for assistance and look into shelters. We actually have an appointment Monday concerning housing assistance. We are trying to get help, the process is just slow going. I was also hired part time recently, but it could be a little while before I start working and get paid (about $130 - $225 a week if I'm lucky).

,My Father passed away Friday morning,"Hello

My father just passed on. He was my best friend. This was unexpected. He got sick out of nowhere mid day Thursday, cold sweats & vomiting all night till his last few hours. It’s a sad time for me right now. Me and my step mom was the only ones home. My father collapsed in the bathroom, he became unconscious. I managed the get him awake by blowing air into his mouth. Got him out the bathroom and laid him on the ground in the hallway. He was gasping for air, very short breaths. I can still see my fathers face, he looked at me with teary eyes as he gasped for air, his heart was failing. My last memory of my father is sickening, it’s on replay in my head. 

My family is distraught right now. Everyone is trying to figure out how to pay for funeral cost and what not. My brothers wife created a gofundme. I’m a avid reddit user so I ended up here. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

,Guinea Pig Vet Fee Help?,"Hi all,

I feel ashamed to even be asking, but I desperately need money with a vet fee.

So the backstory: 
Less than a week ago, I adopted two lil Guinea Pigs from an owner that could no longer care for them. They were in perfect health and just needed a new owner. After bringing them to my home, they began fighting. Apparently this is common when guinea pigs have a change of environment, and it doesn't help that they're currently 'teens' and have hormonal surges and are fighting for dominance.

Anyway, last night around 2am, they had a fight and I separated them so neither was hurt. I couldn't see any wounds as they have thick long fur, and assumed all was well. Today, when cleaning out their cages, I noticed a rather large wound on one of my pigs (I can send a pic via PM if proof is wanted). I've only had them less than a week and can't afford to pay £200 in vet fees for stitches. As I've only had them for such a short time, they're not even registered with a vet and don't have insurance. 

I desperately need help. I'm hoping my kindness on Reddit over the last few years will prove to you guys that I'm a good person. I'm a student so don't have a job, and get a low amount of maintenance help from the Uni, which doesn't come in until towards the end of January.

In exchange, I can offer Guinea pig pics, physics or maths help/tutoring (I'm studying a Physics Degree), or anything else you can think of! I can do website design on Wix or make a cool 3D Model or animation in Maya. Please help, I'm desperate. I have Paypal.

Thanks all, Katie."
,I need help trying to figure out the origin of a sound that keeps playing on my friends computer.,"For a while, my friend has been complaining about a sound playing randomly for no reason.

I cannot find any reverse audio search engines that would work for a sound like this. I have included a link to this on YouTube on a one of my dummy accounts. I also edited the comment to add that it almost seems to be synonymous with Steam and the application ""Soundpad"" which is also on Steam, but we cannot confirm this yet.

,Help with moving expenses - Disabled Airforce Vet & Disabled Wife,"Hello! My name is Lia and my husband, Greg, and I are humbly asking for any assistance possible through a GoFundMe campaign or through my Etsy store for us to be able to afford moving costs. For a long time, we have both lived in a lower income neighborhood and it has only been getting worse here over time. We had been looking at homes to purchase to get away from here and found a house, in another part of the country, that was affordable in a blue collar neighborhood. My husband wanted to see if we would be eligible to get a home loan pre-approved, and he was! However, for him to afford the loan, we had to get married! (THe VA requires it - He is former Airforce medically retired.) We don't have a lot since we are both disabled, and we don't have any family, just a handful of friends, and they aren't financially well off either. We have gone ahead and made the decision to purchase the home, because we seriously fear for our lives here and just want to live somewhere safer..... but they require a good faith deposit which is $500 and a appraiser fee which is also $500. Being disabled, that is insanely difficult to put together. We will also have to figure in costs for a trailer hitch and trailer for our car. Thankfully we don't have much, but it looks like U-haul with a trailer hitch will cost about $375-400. So that burdens us even more. Not to mention the cost of gas, food, and basic travel expenses while we travel across the US. We will be moving from Colorado to Maine. I don't want to give out much more info than that due to privacy reasons, but if you need to know more just send us a PM. According to the realtor and Lending Agent, the move would probably happen around March 1st. Thank you for taking a look and for any assistance should you decide to help! Thank you for your time.

However, if you could listen to our story I would be very appreciative of it. I’m not sure why my story has been down voted on other subreddits as I have posted this to r/charity and r/gofundme 

In November we lost our major source of income which supported us. Our sudden $6000 a month reliable job was outsourced and we were left floundering. 

We have applied for government assistance and are awaiting approval. That still leaves us with piling up household bills, insurance payments, and now medical bills after our infant got RSV and spent a week in the hospital. Our savings is dried up, our families can’t help anymore, and we might very well be evicted if we don’t make rent. 

Asking strangers for help isn’t something O like to do, it took me weeks to muster up the courage to apply for government assistance and go to my first food bank.

The problem is that in a few days I have to start a very good job in the capital city and I have no money for rent, I can't move there to start the job. I need around 100 USD/Euro to pay my rent for a month. It's not much but my mother can't help me cause she's not doing great either and that bastard is tracking everything she's doing.

If I'm not starting this job I don't know what I'm going to do, I'm stuck in this village with my mom and stepdad with no work to do, no friends, nothing. I already lost all my things, my laptop, my watches, my iPhone. I really don't know what else to do.

If you are kind enough to donate 1$/€/£ it would help me a lot, if not, PLEASE GIVE ME A GOOD ADVICE ON WHAT CAN I DO CAUSE I'M REALLY DESPERATE AND IT IS VERY HARD FOR ME TO THINK CLEARLY AT THIS POINT.



Thank you all for the support."
,In need of some emergency advice,"So first off I wanna apologize if this isn't the right subreddit to post this in. I've lurked on reddit before, but never actually made an account or posted. Usually I'm just skulking around game or joke related subs.  


So anyway, like the title says, I'm in need of advice. I'm at my wits end lately as I've fallen incredibly behind on rent and medical bills. For context, about six months ago everything was going fine. I used to be a line cook living in Mass, and my kitchen crew, whom I miss too much to describe, was like family to me. However, I was forced to leave that job after a roomie decided my political beliefs didn't match his enough (I won't go into detail over that unless asked as it both has nothing to do with this post aside from context and I don't want arguing over views). He ended up telling me I had to move, and I didn't have anywhere to go as I was only ever making enough to get by without savings, and moving in with parents isn't an option as my mum has been homeless for some years now. Thankfully some friends, one of whom was part of the original group of roomates I had moved in with in mass, allowed me to stay with them in New York for a couple months. They live in a small town, and finding a job has been incredibly difficult. Most jobs around here seem to be mechanics related, or require years of experience in another field. I'm only 24 and have been working my entire adult life in kitchens, so I'm unqualified for most things. Eventually I got a job as a supermarket, however that went downhill after a couple months. I was an overnight shelf stocker, but I suffer from tourettes that give my a permanent tremor in my hands. This caused me to accidentally smack my hands into shelves, hard, if I tried moving to fast. My managers ended up cutting me to 9 hours a week as a result of this. I'm not trying to make excuses for my poor performance in this job, I really tried hard. I ended up moving from my friend's around mid october, which is when the hour cuts began. This put me about 8 mils from that job at the time. It's important for me to mention that I do not have a car, or a license, as I've never been in a spot in my life where that was an option. Instead what I got myself was a bike with a motor conversion kit. I live in vermont now, still 8 miles from that supermarket in new york(right on the border of the two states). I ended up getting in a bike accident outside that store due to black ice earlier this winter, causing damage to my bike and landing me stranded in the hospital for 2 days. Not because I was badly hurt, I only dislocated a shoulder, but because I had no way to get home, which was 20 miles away and there was a snow storm. Finally my friends got my messages and picked me up, but after that my bike was too damaged to take to that job. It was now a 3 hour walk to work at 11pm at night, making me decide the job wasn't worth my time or the risk it would take me to walk down an 8 mile small town road in the dark of night for a 3 hour shift 3 times a week. I started looking for a new job, and after a couple weeks found one as a dishwasher that so far I'm enjoying, being glad to be back in a kitchen. My land lady is currently letting me use a spare mountain bike to get there. My issue now is I'm still only getting maybe 4 hour shifts, and this job is a 12 mile bike ride down a busy highway in the dark, about 2 hours of peddling in both directions. I get about 20 hours a week, however according to my LL, I'm about 1100 dollars behind, plus my motor bike's rear tire is completely trashed still, needing a new rim, air tube, and tread. Getting that fixed would easily drop the trip time to 20 minutes, not as fast as a car but still really fast. I've been giving my LL every penny I've been making so far as when I started I was being paid daily, however I've just been switched over to check and don't start getting them until this coming wednesday. I haven't even been able to purchase food in a few weeks, having to rely on eggs that a local farm has been more than generous to help me out with.  


So I guess what I'm wondering is if anyone has any advice or ideas on how I could earn the money I need to climb out of this whole I'm finding myself trapped in. Possibly something online, or maybe suggestions for something that might be local. I've tried finding a second job to no avail so far. I really don't like asking for help, and my mum, even while homeless, has been trying her best, and the stress from this situation has been keeping me awake at night. If I could at the very least find a way to get the funds to repair my bike that would help tremendously as these 2 hour bike rides in the cold and dark to and from work have been leaving my feeling more and more fatigued. I've been homeless once before when I was 18 and I'm terrified of going back to that, especially in the cold winters of the north east. I'm really at my wits end and don't know what else to do, so any advice at all would be greatly appreciated, and I'm sorry this is such a huge block of text. If any clarification is needed, please let me know and I'll update this post, and if this isn't the right place to post this and you know a more appropriate subreddit, please let me know. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, that alone means a lot to me."
,I got a new job and could use assistance with dress clothes and shoes.,"So I lost my job and didn't have work for about 2 months. Rent still isn't paid for January, I owe family (and them pesky banks) so much money. I have two jobs now, things are looking up and I'm really trying. The problem is, one job is at an office with a dress code and I was talked to today for wearing my beat up Chuck's. Honestly, besides the 8$ winter boots I thrifted, they're my only shoes. I was hoping there was someone out there that would be willing to donate some dressy clothes and shoes they don't wear or may not fit anymore. I'm 5'5, 125#, I wear medium, size 5ish pants and 8.5 shoes. Thanks y'all"
,No health insurance and really needing to refill prescription for this month.,"TL;DR: I’m a 22-year-old going through some hard times. I would love some assistance with paying for my anti-anxiety/SSRI medication for this month, so I function properly as I continue to get back on my feet. I lost my healthcare but have found a coupon that helps me with costs other than $88.

Hello, friends! 

I am 22-years-old and I have had some mental health issues I’ve been facing for a few years. Just recently, I had returned home after a few months of struggling very badly on my own. I know I have my own issues, and I don’t deny that, but this is the first time I’ve actively sought out help to better them.

My parents insisted that I see a psychiatrist and do some talk-therapy. I don’t have a job due to being in a pretty serious car accident in October, so I have been relying on my parents, mostly my mother, to assist me. I saw a psychiatrist, did some tests and was put on one SSRI, one anti-anxiety med, and something for my newly found ADHD. Not really sure if I should disclose what specifically. And since I’ve started taking them, I’ve been feeling so much better! It gets really hard in the winter during peak sadness times, but I’ve persevered!

However, my mother is going through her own issues and because of it, we do not have health insurance any longer. I am a very resourceful child, as I have tackled most of life through “the art of figuring it out” so I’m great at finding a good deal! GoodRX coupons has helped me get my costs down from 100s of dollars to just $87.94 for the two medicines I need the most. 

It’s crazy to imagine think that some people have to go as far as asking kind strangers on the internet for help affording medication, but I don’t mind being candid about my situation. I’m not embarrassed or ashamed, but I do need help! I want to be able to help out more around the house and finally get back on my feet, but my mental health sometimes makes everything feel impossible even when it’s not.

I am looking to get my 30 day refill and then hopefully I will have income by the end of this month to be able to afford it myself!

I only have Square Cash but willing to figure something out if necessary. Thank you for your time!"
,Requesting financial help for help covering expenses after a back injury,"Requesting financial help for help covering expenses after a back injury

31 year old male here with cerebral palsy. Was recently involved in a car accident While at a go cart facility with a friend. The accident has changed the way that I walk and has caused other medical issues Which I’d rather not get into unless necessary. 
I have spent close to 1000 Dollars out of pocket for different tests and procedures, including MRIs and CT scans. 

Sometime ago I lent a good friend of mine $700 so that he could pay rent so that he and his son would not be without a place to stay. 

I could really use that money now in order to help me pay for physical therapy so that I can walk as close to normally as possible again. 

However my “friend” has fallen off the face of the earth I don’t want to file a police report purely because there wasn’t adequate paperwork that proceeded the loan. That was my fault but I figured after knowing him for five years that he would return the money. Now I am in dire straits because the physical therapy I need along with Botox injections will cost somewhere around $600 with insurance. The sooner I get the therapy the better but I cannot afford it because of my friend absconding with my money. 

I am asking for any Financial help that could be given to me.  I would really really really appreciate some help the fact that my friend Robbed   me has me questioning my faith in friendship and humanity I would appreciate any and all help because I have nowhere else to turn.If you feel so inclined to help me please feel free to PM me directly for further options. Again any help Would be more than appreciated it’s embarrassing for me to even ask. Thanks in advance,

,"[REQUEST] Just Moved into New Home, No Food","Have been homeless for a while but was able to save up enough money to move into room for rent finally and I'm very blessed about that.

,Guilt is covered by love,"My partner is in a bad way, and I’ve discovered this evening he won’t accept my help because he feels he is responsible for the troubles my daughter and I have been through this year.

We moved from Iowa to Nebraska to be with him nearly 2 years ago. This month last year we found my daughter had been molested at her daycare. It devastated all of us. Long story short, I lost my job caring for my child, went homeless, had to move back to Iowa, nearly died of a broken heart and ended up in a psych ward, we went through a miscarriage (our first together, his first child), then found out my roommate here in Iowa is using the rent I pay them to buy and use cocaine and meth (my daughter who is 6, and I, are moving on the 15, and will be reporting that information to authorities). 

He is in financial straights, having just graduated college and racked with debt, his apartment robbed and two of his guns stolen, (but nothing else, and his door wasn’t forced open, how terrifying is that) so now he’s frantic because he fears that someone will get hurt by his weapons and he can’t return to his own house until further notice because it’s a federal crime scene; and he is on the brink of losing his apartment if he can’t find a job that pays more than the part time one he as a TA at the college he graduated from last month. 

My situation is vastly improved. I have a job that pays me well, I’ve gotten back on my feet to the point I can move at 2 weeks notice. 

I’ve offered to help him, but he won’t accept my help because he feels guilty. He thinks he is responsible for the way my daughter was treated at her daycare. He feels he is the cause of all our suffering. 

It’s not his fault. How could it be? Just because we moved to be with him to start a family together? 

I don’t know how to get through to him, to love him out of his guilty and weighted soul. He thinks he’s ruined us, my daughter and I. 

I’ve tried to tell him that she loves him so much, that it’s not possible he has ruined her. She thought of him before her own father for Christmas. I love him- I’d marry him tomorrow if he asked me today. But still, he feels guilt, failure, and shame. No matter how I pray, or how I love and try to comfort him with mind, body, and soul, I can’t help him lift this weight from his mind. I have no answer to this problem.

Do any of you have an answer? He has no health insurance and can’t afford a therapist (he wouldn’t go even if he did have)."
,[REQUEST] Need help raising money for my homeless bf to contact his family,"My boyfriend is from Massachusetts and right now he's having financial problems. He ended up homeless because he was kicked out of the apartment he shared with his roommate who suffered from addiction. He moved to a homeless shelter for a while since he has no place to stay. He has a temporary job but it doesn't provide enough to get him through since his belongings are even getting stolen from the shelter. He doesn't own much right now and as his girlfriend, I'm really concerned and worried about him. I've already tried helping but it's not enough since I'm still a student and I have my debts. I came here to ask for help. He's getting kicked out of the shelter and has no place to go. We communicate using a phone he borrowed from a friend in the shelter. I'm hoping I could raise enough money so he could buy a decent phone to contact his family and have some clothes to replace the stolen ones. Here are some screenshots from our conversation last night as proof.

,"[REQUEST] Got laid off at work, struggling to make ends meet.","Hi everyone! I only discovered this subreddit today, so I hope I'm making this post correctly. 

I've had the same job as an assistant to the HR manager at my location for a while, but I found out recently that my job just... No longer exists. I was being paid poorly in the first place, I had two jobs just to pay my bills, but my second job has extremely limited hours (I can't get more than 16 hours a week most of the time, I get 24 hrs if I'm lucky), and my hours at both jobs were limited further than usual in the last pay period due to circumstances outside of my control, so I'm very scared about the future. I've applied for 20 jobs in the past week, but I haven't even gotten called back by any of them yet and I have some important bills coming up soon– car payment and car insurance– so I'm going to be just over $200 short, assuming I don't have any unexpected necessary expenses before then.

I would appreciate any help people are willing to offer, even if it doesn't cover my bills. I do have a Paypal account, but I don't currently use any other such services. This is a very stressful time for me, and I'm honestly just very grateful that there's spaces like this where I can seek help."

...another EDIT (sorry): 

My car insurance situation has actually gotten kind of dire and I’ll need to make a bunch of money really quick to acquire insurance.  I have proof that Progressive insurance is selling quotes based off of old information.  So I have switched back to GEICO, but I have a past due amount.  I need to make ~~$650~~ ~~$332~~ $0 to cover my last due balance from a 2014 policy AND to cover the first month of a new premium.  THANK YOU EVERYONE!

~~Progressive 6mo liability only quote: $358/mo~~


GEICO 6mo liability only quote: $91/mo


I am willing to produce any documentation necessary as well as the proof that Progressive uses old data from a third party company called LexisNexis when selling its quotes.  These quotes are massively inflated to the point of insanity.  I know my case is not special in the eyes of their customer service or sales team; which means if they are going to willfully attempt to rob me—they will do the same to any of you so I urge caution and extreme investigations into any car insurance rates.  

**I have over 100 unreleased original melodies and I will give them to anyone (mp3/wav) who wants one for $3 or any donation amount.** I’ll even make you special request creations if you give me the instruments you want used.  I’ll do whatever I can to create you something amazing. I want to use my craft and creativity to get me out of this mess.  ##**I could really use the extra money while I wait for my student loan disbursement on January 24th.** I hope you understand.

I also sell websites if you are a small business looking to grow and get your name out there.   I would make a commission referring you to the designer.  They do excellent custom work.

Thanks again for letting me use this platform to ask for help!"

,"Alfred here, desperate for advice for my friend. Help","She is 15 years old, same as me. She is really sad and I think even depressed. From what she's told me, her family kind of don't care about her feelings at all. Her mother's alcoholic and don't seem to care for her and her little brother. She told me her problems last week, New year's eve, half joking through text. She told me she had been crying for 2 hours because of her relatives indifference, that her ear started bleeding (maybe stress?) and that she's, overall, not good. Her head hurts and she's been having problems walking since a week or so and I think her sleeping habits are part of the cause (she's been sleeping around 3-4
AM since a long time, and since summer (Chile) started she's been outside, near a neighbor's house to steal wifi till 4-5). I'm really, really worried about her. She's my best friend and learning about her situation for the first time hurts so fucking much I started to cry. I tried to tell her that I'm here to listen, that she doesn't need to hurry up to tell me her problems, that I know it can be hard to do so, and she says that she's really happy that I'm supporting her. But I just can't shake this feeling that I'm doing something wrong and that I'm worsening her situation and making her uncomfortable and it's making me really really  anxious.

,I need some help to where would be the best place for a friend to move so he can escape his country,"I have a friend who lives in Egypt and is currently trying to escape the country and living on his own at age 17. His parents kicked him out at age 13 and he's been living on his own since. He then participated in a manifestation against the totalitarian government that failed, and everyone (including him) has been heavily frowned upon, that made it so he couldn't find a job for a long time and no one there helped him or communicated with him in any way.

He has to save up 1 million EGP (around 62,5k dollars) to be able to move out and if possible make it in the four years he will have to spend in college. For that he has to work 2 full time jobs to do that. He and a friend of his will amass that amount of money, so it would be 500k EGP to save. To do that, he would have to earn more than 62,5k EGP yearly from each job.

He found a job but had to quit for a better job which didn't include the boss not treating him like everyone because of the manifestation, but unfortunately the boss of the shop he was working in is closing the shop because he's getting married.

He now is forced to move out to be able to work and earn the money needed to move out of the country but doesn't know where to move. Can you guys give some advice about where he should move considering the following requierements?

\- Anywhere on the coutry

\- Has to have a college about programming or 3D modelling. If not possible writing or directing

\- High demand jobs

\- Cheap housing (he can do with cheap small apartments)

Hoping someone can assist with a quick favor. Long story short, I typically pay rent via ACH and just realized that due to a double withdrawal the payment reversed. I have to make the payment today to avoid a late fee but that means using my card and paying the 3% fee. I’m short $25 right now, but I’ll have it Monday (funds on hold via eBay). I’d ask family and friends, but I’m the one that helps everyone out, so not an option atm. If you’re able to assist, I can send it back via PayPal or CashApp Monday . Thanks for considering regardless.

We all do music (you guys can request that if you want to hear some stuff I am happy to share) Make videos my girlfriend Ari loves to dance and on a collegiate level for one of the local colleges here and we pursue and work at our passions and dreams everyday trying to fill some light at the ends of our tunnels after all the stress and long workdays and ovetime hours we put ourselves through.

So if anyone is in a position themselves to lend a hand and help us out to give us an edge we see nowhere in site to allow us to be able to get the tracks back on and get ahead, it would really honestly change all of our lives. So thank you below is a link to our Go-Fund me:

,"[Request] Shoes, Shirts & Pants For Work!","Update: The only thing I would need now are pants, but I can wait on those! 

Hi!

I'm going to have my first full day at my first job on Jan. 11th (I have a few training hours throughout this week where I don't have to be in uniform) and I really need clothes for work. The most important thing I need right now are slip resistant shoes. As part of my uniform, I need black shirts and black pants. I asked about wearing leggings and was ensured that that's what most people wear anyway since the shirts we wear over top of our black shirts are long and leggings are more comfortable to work in. I do have a few pairs of leggings right now, but they are kind of wearing out since I've had them for over a year. I could probably hold off on getting new ones for a few paychecks if needed.

My parents and I are going through some stuff right now and they refuse to pay for anything despite me needing this job. I can explain more if it's necessary, but it's just a big issue for them to pay for anything. Once I get a few paychecks in I'm going to start to pay it forward in this sub!

,Please help me hook my phone plan back up! Military veteran in need of assistance.,"So, the last couple months have been rough. My fiancé and I have struggled finding a place to stay and keep warm whilst taking care of her disabled father. We went from Kentucky, to West Virginia, to now Tennessee in a span of a month trying to find a temporary home. We have tried contacting both sides of our family to help with our financial trouble, but so far neither has tried to help. I’ve been in the army for 5 years now and I’m awaiting an honorable discharge. I signed the papers before the holidays and I’m awaiting my DD 214 which is a certificate of honorary service. I went to the Veteran Affairs office to help us with our housing situation, currently I can’t call them or reach out for help because I need $50 to hook back up my phone plan. Yes, I know it’s a lot and I hate even asking. But if I can get my phone hooked up I can reach out to multiple people to help us get back on track through the VA office. Including calling my unit to rush them on my discharge, that’s why the VA cannot help me as is. They have to have my DD 214 form which I cannot get because I cannot contact my unit. We are currently staying at a friends apartment and in two days we’ll be overstaying the 14 day stay limit set. After the 14 days we will have no place to stay, so please, if you read this. Pitch in what you have to help us find a way to get some financial help. Oh, and in case you’re curious I’m outside a library in a  downtown city at 00:34 in the morning to get WiFi to ask for help."
,A journey back into Photography.,"Hello. I am 26 by the time of writing this. Back in 2014, I was started my photography mainly nature and landscape but, in the late 2016, depression of mine (PDD) hits heavily into my life and I've lost the eager to shoot, and other hobbies; selling all the stuff and ditch out photography all in one bin. It was tough moments in my life starting around early 2017 till mid of 2019 but yes, I just keep on going with work life, love life and just keep myself in one piece towards the day.

For the time being, I am fine, and healthy. I am trying to get back into photography that I usually do back in the day but it is hard because mainly, camera stuff was really expensive.

So therefore, I was looking for a donation from you guys that reading this, to help me out, send a donation into my budget to afford a second hand Nikon D750, decent preloved wide angle lens and other equipment such as ND filters, memory sticks, batterries and tripod.

My plan is for now, collect my own money plus savings plus some donation from you guys just to afford a set of complete gear. Along the way, I work out my portfolio, travel though out my country, sharpen my skills and eventually getting back on track and making this as my life work or a side income. Simply, photograph the world.

I was trying to get around 2000USD (8205 in MYR) and I am barely getting to half of it.

For the time being, I just feeding my love of photography just using and old iPhone 6s.

You can checkout my instagram profile @faizabdn and my work at flickr.com/faizabidinphoto.

Kindly reach me via PM for the donation.

I honestly could think any idea to repay if the donations for the time being. 

Thank you."

I have two kids who I have primary custody of and “breaking down” has never been an option. I reached the point where I started cutting again (hadn’t since I was a teen) to cope with the emotional pain, instead of reaching out. Recently, the dam snapped— at work (crying, panic attack, revealing to my supervisor exactly what was happening in my life including the self harm). I had to take several shifts off so I could recover and seek counseling resources (including getting assessed by a local facility to find resources).

Next paycheck will be extremely short as well since the break happened between pay period swaps. 

I need advice what I can do in the mean time, or anyone willing to assist. I am selling all I can on local FB pages, but I don’t have much as it is."

Hello everyone. I'm a momma bear of 4 little ones hoping for a blessing in a tough situation. 
I was able to buy a minivan with the bit of money I saved up. Literally 8 days later the head gasket blew. I'm in TN so there is no inspection :(. I had no idea there was anything wrong with it. . In turn, I lost my job due to not being able to get there. I got a notice to quit for failure to pay rent. I was able to pay Novembers rent a few weeks ago. So I'm only a month behind now. .but in a few days it will be 2 again :( December 3rd I had to rent a car to take my daughter 5 hours to nashville. Monroe childrens hospital. She had emergency heart surgery to stop blood flowing from her heart into her lungs that was essentially drowning her. Thankfully the surgery was a success and her recovery is going great but we now facing being homeless. I've applied at nearly every place hiring and even places that aren't within a 10 mile radius of where we are living.  I don't mind walking to work even if its 10 miles. I will do whatever it takes to keep a roof over our heads. I've applied for child support but their dad is dodging them like crazy with every excuse in the book.  I'm still hopeful.  If anyone is able to help my family, I would be forever grateful

,"I'm being held hostage by disability insurance, facing eviction","I tend to be very verbose, so please excuse me as I try to sum this up as quickly as possible.  I have done the registration already, not sure if it is showing up yet.

&#x200B;

I was in a car accident (not at fault) on July 9th of 2019. Due to a combination of physical and neurological issues, I was to be out of work until at least November 9th. I was evaluated at that time, and doctors pushed back my return to work until January 2nd.

This was a 100% approved leave, and I was placed on short term disability via my employers insurance company, Sedgwick.

The road with Sedgwick is never easy - I had to use them once before for a severe illness - but I had all my ducks in a row and knew exactly what paperwork to submit. The first payment was on time, the others were 1 to 5 weeks late, but then they stopped at the end of September.

It took me weeks to find out why. Basically, because they didn't want to pay any more, Sedgwick claims that my doctors advised I was refusing meds and treatment. So, Sedgwick shut down and denied my claim. This is, of course, false and I asked each of my treating doctors if they told Sedgwick this, which they didn't. In addition, I asked Sedgwick to provide documented proof of this claim, which they refused (that's illegal, btw).

Sedgwick has me hostage right now. I have been trying to return to work since early December, with a verified letter from my doctor saying I was cleared. Sedgwick however has to approve this return, and they of course still have not, so I am not getting any wages. If I try to work elsewhere, I will lose my current job, and with it my benefits, which means Sedgwick can throw out my case entirely and I lose those months of missing pay.

I have a disability lawyer working  with me now to get the appeal done, but the process will take months. I also still have my accident claim open through the other drivers insurance, but those also take many many months.

I have maxed out every credit card, taken ever predatory loan, drained every savings account, turned to every friend and family member I have, sold or pawned every spare piece of electronics and swag, and even opened an eBay shop to sell pokemon cards and MMO collectables. I am a huge lurker on Reddit and after 5+ years didn't have 300 karma yet, so my spouse may have previously tried to make a post here for us, but nothing came of the attempt. I farmed that karma and am here now, humble and really needing help.

Rent was due on January 3rd and will continue to gain late fees until they evict us. They move quickly with evictions in these apartments - I suspect they'll serve us the notice by the end of next week. I am asking for help to keep the lights on and keep a roof over my family's heads while I fight to get my job, and money, back. We have enough left in paypal to take care of groceries for maybe a week, but that won't matter if we are evicted."
,Need physical therapy because back and neck injury is making it difficult to work (as a server),"Hey all! I'm located in round rock texas and I'm a single mother struggling with a few health issues. One of the ones giving me the most trouble is this pain I've got completely surrounding my right shoulder blade and going up my neck. It aches constantly, it wakes me up from my sleep, and most importantly, it makes it difficult to work. I am a server and need to be able to carry heavy trays around all day long. I try alternating arms each time I leave the kitchen with a tray of food to keep equal strength on each side of my body. I'm not great about making time to work out but I'm trying to do better. Last year  I was able to go to a couple of physical therapy sessions which helped tremendously. This wasnt costing me anything because I had reached my out of pocket max on my health insurance. Unfortunately, with the start of a new year came the start of a new deductible. This makes my PT appointments 100% of the cost, not even a copay. I desperately need to get back to physical therapy so that I can have assistance with myofacial release and coaching on exercises and stretches. Due to some recent diagnostic procedures for other issues that have cost me thousands of dollars out of pocket (and up front), I'm totally broke. I dont even have the money necessary to keep up with my monthly bills. I'm looking for either a physical therapist who can work something out with me or monetary assistance. If you have any other ideas, I'm all ears. Much appreciated."
,Requesting a birthday gift for my daughter,"So you can probably see in my history that my family and I are going through some hard times. 2 of my kids are having to live separately from me for the next 2-2.5 months which we are all finding extremely difficult.

I could send a link to one of the kits I was looking into, or they’re also available on my amazon wishlist. (Please note I do have several kits on the wish list, but that’s only because they’re all adorable and I suck at decision making but she would love any one of them!)

,Help Needed to Fund a Manual Custom Wheelchair,"I'm having trouble leaving my home due to severe joint pain in my legs. I've tried to get help from doctors for years, but I can no longer wait for them to help. I've tried using a cane to help me walk but as I tend to trip over my own feet constantly adding a third tinier foot just made things worse.

&#x200B;

I have neurological and physical disabilities that stop me from being able to use other modes of transportation. I can't use the bus as it triggers seizures, I can't walk or ride a bike because of balance and joint pain issues, and cab fares are expensive. I believe a manual wheelchair would best suit my needs.

&#x200B;

I'm almost completely home-bound now unless I have cab fare. With a wheelchair I will be able to go see a doctor when/if needed throughout the month, drop off and pick up prescriptions as needed, buy groceries, and I could even take my dog to the dog park several blocks away.

&#x200B;

The issue is that without a proper doctor it would be close to impossible to get a custom wheelchair covered so I need to raise the money myself. The reason for a custom chair is that I am shorter than average and places where used chairs can be found tend to not suit my needs or fit my short legs.

&#x200B;

I've checked local organizations out with no luck, and have asked close friends and relatives for help, I have what money I could raise this way saved in a savings account. I don't need the chair inside my apartment so the assistive devices program is also a no go as you must need it indoors and outdoors. In a bit of desperation I even called my mother who I haven't spoken to in years (bad idea, which I am still dealing with emotionally).

&#x200B;

I already know the wheelchair I would like to purchase, the Quickie GPV Sports Everyday use Wheelchair, and have gone over the sizing and options for it. I've even decided on a colour, black cherry! Everything is ready I just need enough money to cover all the expenses. 

&#x200B;

I do not need an electric/motorized scooter or chair as I can still use my upper body to push myself.

&#x200B;

I've been debating as to whether or not to get some frog leg casters for it as they would help with my joint problems, but that would add to the expense and I don't want to ask for too much.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time and consideration.

,Im 15 and my dad's anger is starting to get out of control. I dont know what to do,"TL:DR at the end

Let me start by saying neither of my parents are abusive physically and dont hit me, only my dad is verbally abusive, and recently he has been getting angry at me for the littlest of things I mess up.

This last week going into 2020 all I did was forget to take out recycling and he ended up throwing an empty gallon bottle towards me, and when asked to stop he told me that he could do what he wants because its his house. 2 days later (Night of the 3rd) Im loading my bike into his SUV to get a new tire tomorrow and theres some of my moms stuff in the trunk that she wanted to sell or something so I put my bike back into the garage. Later I ask what to do with the stuff and my dad just loses his shit and starts telling me how goddamn stupid I am and how hes tired of my shit when i did nothing wrong. He yelled at me the loudest ive ever heard him yell, and this was at almost midnight too so it felt extra loud, and says to me ""Go to bed and dont say a fucking word to me, I dont care if you need water and I dont care if you need to take a piss just get your ass in bed"" He also said ""go to bed and shut your door, dont give water to the dogs, nobody cares""

Im wondering what I should do to stop this and at the very least tone things down so I dont get told every time I fuck up that I suck at life and how nobody cares, or how im a dick to everybody and only care about myself. If this is nothing to worry about and Im just a pussy and should deal with it just say it cause ive been told many times that they had it worse and that im weak.

&#x200B;

TL:DR My dads anger has been going up too much for little things and im looking to stop it and at least tone it down"
,Small amount for food,"I finally got the chance to move away from my emotionally abusive family! But it's come at a time when money is very tight, since my job is barely scheduling me this month and bills are due. I also have to buy necessities for the move (toilet paper, some form of dishes, trash bags/can, etc) and therefore am struggling a bit on what to do about food.

I will have a little bit of money after the 15th of this month, but making it to then requires a bit of help, sorry. At max, I could use $20, but given how steep that is all I'm really requesting is $10 to help me buy some basics to get me through until I have money again. Thank you!

,"Went two weeks without work and ran out of cash, check out at hotel was today","So I was without work for two weeks and the cash I had dried up, Paying for a hotel the last couple week sapped what I had and check out was this morning. 

I’m back to work Tuesday, but won’t get paid until the following Wednesday and my family is unable to help with anything. I don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t have credit, and I seem to be rejected everywhere I go for a loan. (I know the interest rates are ridiculous, but sometimes you gotta take what you can get.)

I have $1.50 left to my name, which isn’t enough for food, or even transportation.

,Halfway There! Got a job interview Monday but need some gas money and some food.,"First I want to say everyone here is amazing. My last post someone sent us enough for some food and gas for the trip. One kind soul even asked for my wishlist to send me a gift which blew me away.

We're almost back to getting on our feet. My husband got a job interview and the final interview is Monday. We know he's going to nail it, but after the interview we will be out of gas. It's too cold and too far to walk everyday. We also need some dairy products again. I went to the food bank and specifically asked for milk, butter, eggs, and sugar. And they gave me everything but those. Hell, half the boxes were for cornbread or brownies or hamburger helper. All that needs some kind of something we don't have.

I'm basically asking for $20 bucks gas money so he can get through the interview and pay period, and probably $10-20 for food. We have one grocery store in town that does online orders and a Cinex, Conoco, and Chevron for gas cards. One kind soul was leery because I had to make a PayPal because all we had was Zelle and CashApp. So I figured I would list what places we have available so everyone knows if we receive any money it will be spent on what I asked for.

My husband and I are so close to getting back on track and anything anyone can do is absolutely wonderful.

Edit: We are overdrawn on our account by $50 which includes the overdraft. I had forgotten about this. We have a friend that can come into town tomorrow and let us use her account and she will withdraw it. So we can't do anything today unless some people go way above and beyond for us.

It's not a big place but it will be just me but well.....

What stuff might i not realize I need or what words of wisdom might people not think to give family/friends who move on their own.

I know get a plunger before you need it, but well... I have a slight fear that things will go bad enough to hit me hard enough to bring my darker thoughts back if i mess up to much and well yeah...

,Desperately need help with rent.,"I just joined, am in pretty desperate need of help with rent. My husband and I knew we'd be a little short this month, but we thought it'd be by a couple hundred dollars. Instead, we're in a situation where I have about $630 in checking, my husband has -$45 because he overdrafted paying for parking at work today, rent is $1,025, and we still have to pay for gas, parking, and groceries for the week.

If we don't pay in full by 5pm tomorrow, an 8% late fee gets applied to the unpaid portion. If we don't have the full amount of rent plus the late fee paid by the 10th, they start the eviction proceedings, and we'll be responsible for about $500 in court fees. We've talked to them about this before and they are 100% inflexible on this, they do not make exceptions or allow extensions.

Usually he does Uber and I do freelance transcription work when we need extra cash, but he's sick and isn't able to do Uber right now--he probably shouldn't be going to work, but he can't afford not to--and the web site I do transcription work through has hardly had any work posted lately so I haven't been able to.

I get paid on the 10th. If the full deficit isn't made up by then, I can cover whatever is left. But I'm genuinely worried that if we aren't able to make up any of the deficit in the meantime, my next paycheck won't be enough to cover everything plus other non-delayable bills that come out of that check, and we'll be in serious trouble.

We don't really have family nearby who can help, so I'm turning to you, The Internet. I can give my PayPal or CashApp upon request if needed. Anything anyone can do to help out would be so much appreciated.

EDIT: thanks so much to the generosity of a fellow Redditor, we're only a couple hundred short now to cover rent and gas/parking. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"

,Requesting financial help for help covering expenses after a back injury,"31 year old male here with cerebral palsy. Was recently involved in a car accident While at a go cart facility with a friend. The accident has changed the way that I walk and has caused other medical issues Which I’d rather not get into unless necessary. 
I have spent close to 1000 Dollars out of pocket for different tests and procedures, including MRIs and CT scans. 

Sometime ago I lent a good friend of mine $700 so that he could pay rent so that he and his son would not be without a place to stay. 

I could really use that money now in order to help me pay for physical therapy so that I can walk as close to normally as possible again. 

However my “friend” has fallen off the face of the earth I don’t want to file a police report purely because there wasn’t adequate paperwork that proceeded the loan. That was my fault but I figured after knowing him for five years that he would return the money. Now I am in dire straits because the physical therapy I need along with Botox injections will cost somewhere around $600 with insurance. The sooner I get the therapy the better but I cannot afford it because of my friend absconding with my money. 

I am asking for any Financial help that could be given to me.  I would really really really appreciate some help the fact that my friend Robbed   me has me questioning my faith in friendship and humanity I would appreciate any and all help because I have nowhere else to turn.If you feel so inclined to help me please feel free to PM me directly for further options. Again any help Would be more than appreciated it’s embarrassing for me to even ask. Thanks in advance,

,I have to sleep in my car tonight. I’m scared.,"I made quite a mess of everything. I wasn’t able to pay rent yesterday and my roommate kicked me out. I am getting money tomorrow to pay rent (wasn’t able to receive help in time today) and I used the rest of my money on a really dodgy hotel last night. I am a female and I have spent the last 16 hours in my car trying to figure out what to do but I just am frozen with fear and shame. I don’t know what to do any advice would be nice. It’s late so I’m pretty sure I have no chance of getting out of my car today. My pup is keeping out of shelters and there’s a long waiting list in my state. I have hope coming but today is just the darkest day I have ever had.

-Update a couple hours later- after reaching out to my family and having to come clean about my life and situation (I tried to hide my massive depression and lack of self care for months) the second I asked for a couch to sleep on I had to tell all. I kind of felt good to talk about it. I got the question of am i doing drugs. That almost seemed easier to admit than this crippling depression and extreme lack of motivation to help myself since I got out of the army and the paychecks/unemployment dried up. I haven’t been okay in months and I finally had to do something about it today. 

-My sister begrudgingly offered up her couch for one night and before I started to head there, also begrudgingly, my roommate responded to my plea for one more day. I also have a plan in place with her tmw to sign a lease finally. Also, bonus points she wasn’t home so no awkwardness yet. 

Some positives to share that I came away with on my absolute rock bottom day- I found short term and long term rental assistance through a county veteran program. Also food assistance. I’ve been starving for weeks. I highly recommend looking into other government veterans programs because apparently the VA isn’t the only one. I went in for emergency help and left with that the prospect of super long term help and advice from the government worker and a random dad in line behind me ❤️. 

I finally logged in to my college account (I was so scared and ashamed to after failing last semester) and saw that my account is active I owe no money (to the school, the gi bill debt is def still coming out of my disability payments)  and can begin using my gi bill again despite failing said semester. 

-failing college last year was the single most destructive thing I’ve ever done to myself. I took everything for granted. I have come to terms with why I failed but it’s still scary. Veterans really do have an awesome GI bill, I was receiving $1800/mo just to go to class. Plus various grants and a couple little student loans went away as well. I actively, and for the foreseeable future lose exactly 50% of my VA pension each month. 2019 me was stupid. 

Thanks for the advice kind strangers. 😏

UPDATE 24 hours later-

In case y’all are curious about my plight and to ease your minds about the roommate situation. My roommate didn’t legit kick me out she was demanding rent money and until I solved it I was basically hiding. Pathetic I am aware. I am definitely one of those people who doesn’t understand “bad news gets worse over time“ and needs to understand avoidance is not the way to handle serious problems. I don’t know why I’m like that but it’s definitely a huge problem. I signed a month to month lease today and I am not getting kicked out like y’all thought. My landlord/roommate is definitely a bitch some times and has entirely TOO MANY DOGS but I also have a pup who has been through everything with me and is my sidekick. She is the only reason why I live with this specific lady. No one (not literally but practically) rents rooms to people with pets. It’s crazy. I absolutely cannot afford a place on my own so I am stuck here. My dog gets to socialize and enjoy a fenced backyard so I am content with it. I really really wish she’d fix her girl pup so she stops getting her period and pregnant but I digress. 

Positives from day one of digging out of my gigantic hole- I have a voucher from this county vet program that will be signed and submitted for a check for rent. I’m really dreading the conversation I’m about to have with my roommate about not ACTUALLY having the money today and having to wait for a check to be mailed. I was definitely not tracking how the whole process went and I naively thought I’d be given a check today. I’m an idiot. Pray for me that she doesn’t kill me but hey I was literally just given $600 just because I am a struggling veteran. Cannnnot complain there. The kind guy also gave me a $100 grocery voucher. Wow.

Huge positive- I signed up for school today and start Monday. Full time. Every day. For the first time in 6+ months I have a consistent reason to get out of the bed/house. I’m also getting educated and will be socializing with people who are not my family or landlord for the first time in months. I’m very excited and of course, nervous. Failing college again would devastate me mentally and financially. 

Thank you all for your comments and if anyone has any questions about assistance from your county/govt (not just veterans) let me know! 

TL;DR: got my rent covered but it will a week late, sign a new lease and signed up for college that will help me mentally and financially (gi bill housing money is 2.5 times the amount of my rent!).

Update 26- my roommate landlord just told me she can’t make her mortgage payment now. She was really expecting me to come through today. I had no idea and now I feel awful. 😔"

,I’m numb and it seems logical to kill myself,"I (21F) cannot stand the three roommates I live with (who were originally my friends) and the stress of home life has been so intense that two months ago, my body just kinda shut out all emotions as a protective measure. I’ve been actively suicidal before but I always remember how I’ve gotten through the situation before so I’ll be fine. But this is new. No happiness, no sadness. Nothing. I have no idea when or if it will end. I saw a therapist today and she confirmed my thoughts but she can’t see me for two weeks as the semester starts. I feel indifferent as to whether I’ll live or die. My roommates don’t get back for the semester for five days and it just seems a lot easier for everyone to just not exist than to live as someone without feelings for possibly forever."

,Please help family of 4,"Hi all this is my first time posting here and I am so grateful to have found this place and really hoping to find some help. We are a small family of 4 with our twins being 7. We have hit a very rough patch at the moment. I work in fast casual food and my husband is sub contracted to install flooring. Only problem is my husband has not been given any jobs in over a month and we have found ourselves in a major bind surviving off my paycheck to paycheck income. We thought for sure after the holidays he would start getting work orders but since he is without a helper they aren’t giving him any jobs. Most flooring jobs require 2 people due to moving heavy stuff and need to be complete in a timely manner. His partner recently found out he has Crohn’s after being taken to the emergency room and having 2 feet of his intestines removed. So he will surely not be returning to work with my husband. And to add the icing to the cake we moved from Ca to Ky so my husband could make better money and provide a better opportunity for us because cost of living here is way cheaper than Cali. But now we are out here with no friends or family to turn to (they really wouldn’t be in a position to help anyways) he is hoping to find a helper however it’s hard to find someone that you can trust to take to work in other people homes. Anyhow we really need help at the moment with food most importantly. Bills I can try to push back till payday. Gas to get to work is really needed but food and hygiene is most important for us especially for my kids. I really appreciate anyone who take the time to read this and I will pay it forward as soon as i am in a position to do so. I created an amazon food and hygiene list and any item would help immensely, I do have cash app and zelle if anyone would rather help with gas money. But I think food is of the utmost importance.

,"I have IBS, bipolar disorder, had 4 tumors removed, and have been fighting for three years to find employment and assistance. Denied for foodstamps, Medicare, and disability. My rent just came out of my bank account and I'm overdrafted. I need serious help.","My Jan 1st rent/electric bill payment has overdrafted my account by $340.

I'm from Ohio and almost three years ago I started having a severe problem with my stomach. I'd be in serious pain and discomfort, going to the bathroom for hours a day. I worked for a bank and after a couple months of this, they told me I either had to file for disability or quit because I was no longer fit for the job. I left the job and applied for disability, which denied me with the reasoning ""because it is deemed you can lift boxes in a warehouse setting, you are fit to work."" This doesn't take into account that my IBS has me running to the bathroom for 15-20 minutes every hour or so, which no employer will reasonably put up with.

Later the same year after losing my job at the bank, I had a colonoscopy which discovered four tumors in my intestines and colon which I had removed. The medical debt from this has went to collections and I fully expect I'll never be able to pay it back. It is uncertain how the tumors contributed to my condition, but my symptoms haven't improved. Colon cancer runs in my family and I'm terrified.

I ended up getting another job at a museum, but they started writing me up for absurd things like my e-mail signature having a broken link in it. Eventually, they stopped masking what they were doing and told me outright that they did not find me suitable for work due to my disability and the amount of time I needed to use the restroom each day. I supplied medical evidence to see if they could make some sort of concession for me, but they said the medical evidence proved I was unable to sustain tasks for long enough to fulfill the requirements of the job, so I lost that job, too.

I started driving for delivery apps in August and this was actually pretty good to me for a while. I've had to lay low, eat peanut butter and ramen, and work every single day on delivery apps, but I was bringing home JUST enough to cover the rent. Unfortunately, these apps experience a significant downturn in Dec/Jan due to people not having the expendable income for expensive delivery food, and the amount of money I make per shift has been cut in half or more. I sold some old videogames I had lying around to help me, but my Jan 1st rent payment/electric bill has overdrafted my account by $340.

I have applied for benefits, which I'm always denied for because my wife and I filed our taxes jointly and her $14/hour job is apparently enough for the state to say we make too much for food stamps and Medicare. I've applied for disability twice and been denied twice. I got a lawyer who said, verbatim, ""with your history of mental illness I'm going to have a hard time convincing the state that this isn't all in your head."" I've been applying for jobs but never even get a call back I imagine because the large holes in my employment history.

Since November I've been working with a state agency that helps find jobs for people with disabilities. I had to go take a job skills assessment with them, but I won't hear anything about possible jobs until my next appointment at the end of January.

I don't know what to do and I need help critically today. I'm one of many sick Americans who is falling through the cracks. Thanks for reading this.

If you have any resources to help me find jobs that might work with my IBS, please let me know."

,I need help. Again. Imagine that.,"Earlier this year (2019) as December was coming to say “see ya!” I got put in the hospital. Found out all sorts of wrong things with me. Mainly the liver failure. So I kinda closed up shop and awoke in a different hospital with much more of a “YOURE dying! But don’t give up hope!” Kinda vibe. So, I held onto help, finally got out, and here I am. Back at square one, at my parents farmhouse. This after my brother stole/threw away a lot of “weapons” from video games and what not. I was planning on selling them damn things in order to get a battery for my vehicle. So, now I sit here, cold as fuck with a vehicle that won’t start, I feel that “not giving a shit” creature rearing it’s ugly head. If anyone wants to throw a few bucks my way and help me get a battery for the vehicle, I would be eternally grateful, because as of now, I have 7 bucks to my name.

,Seeking work and $200 short on rent,"Hi everyone. To make a long story short, I went to the hospital to get treatment for anxiety and ptsd and was fired while I was in there by my former employer. I then had to spend two months fighting for unemployment while looking for jobs.

,"Going in for surgery, don't have enough in savings to cover all the bills","I've been saving for surgery but was told that I have to go in sooner rather than later and I'm not to my saving goal.

Normally this is a surgery that you can put off, however I have other health issues that are made worse by not having this dealt with right away.

I basically need a mastectomy, FTM top surgery to be more precise.

I have warped ribs, difficulty breathing and moderate degenerative arthritis in my spine due to having an oversized chest that weighs too much and is too dense so that short term binding is more risky (I've only been binding lightly for 2 years)  
I work a very physical job with long hours and overtime, requiring a lot of heavy lifting and running around so back and breathing problems are interfering with my employment.  I have also picked up a second part time job over the last year to save for this. I work on a slow day 9.5 hours but upto 12 hours if busy with both jobs 5-6 days a week. 

The surgery, meds, other medical equipment and transportation have been/are covered between insurance, the government, and my savings account which will be completely drained after this.

I have asked friends and family to help me to cook, clean and dress myself for the first week as I'll be pretty much a baby T-Rex for the first week at least and I have a few friends that are willing to help longer if needed.  


I'm saving up as much as I can while I'm still at work but I will be off between January the 15th through February the 6th and I have bills that would normally be paid with that cheque that those hours would normally cover and I cover most of my families bills.   
I am also trying to find more ways to save money as well as talking to various companies to see if I can get some payments deferred.   


I'd love any help and/or advise as I only have about 2 weeks to get this sorted.

A lot of equipment in the salon was damaged and stolen, insurance for the salon covers these things. The one stylist who left her tools had all of her tools stolen or damaged. My heart breaks as it's literally her livelihood and everything she needs to make money has been taken from her, and she has little savings to be able to purchase new equipment. (All stylists are independent so our insurance doesn't cover her tools.) I broke my wrist a few weeks back, so I haven't been making money and I have been living off of my savings, or I would help her purchase what she needs, but because I haven't been working it's impossible for me to do so. I have been letting her use my equipment while I am not working, but I have 2 more weeks until my cast is off and I will need my equipment.

,Having trouble making Car payments after multiple hospitalizations.,"Hi, I had no idea this sub existed and I have no idea where this post will lead, but I figure it's worth a shot.

My story: I am a 39 year old woman. I lived in New England for all of my life until I left in the fall of 2018. I was having trouble finding work in the area I lived in (total cow towns. I lived in a city of 5,000 people and any decent metro areas were 45-60 minutes in any direction.) I was presented with an opportunity to work with a former colleague at a ""dream job"" (fitness instructor) in Tucson, AZ. It was a pay cut BUT costs of living were significantly lower (by hundreds per month). The person I was to be working for was considered to be a well respected/educated member of the community and had worked for people I knew in the past so I felt like even though it was a huge leap of faith it would be a good move. I got really great recommendations on her from high level folks/former bosses and teachers. After a few weeks, the red flags were everywhere: being asked to work for no pay, being told I needed to pay out of pocket ($850) for 40 hours of training, having to do a bunch of volunteer work, and in general a really dismissive/condescending attitude from my new boss. Because of the training and ""volunteer"" schedule, I didn't have time to work anywhere else, so I did grubhub and uber when I could but I was tapped out for funds. I stuck it out despite all the red flags and it ended with her screaming at me about how ""toxic"" I was and that she couldn't have me at her studio. I never even got to finding a place or unpacking my car. I decided to head back East because I didn't know what else to do. I didn't have a place anymore, I don't have any family to speak of (more on that later) but I figured at least I had friends in that direction. I slept in my car for a while and a friend in Columbus, OH offered me her spare room, and I took it.

So I decided to stay in OH. I got a full time job in my old field and things were pretty okay and I recovered somewhat.

Now, back history, which complicates things: I come from a significant abuse/trauma history and have mental health issues because of it. I was groomed for sexual abuse for as long as I can remember, and both my parents were sexually abusive (my mom was more like inappropriate touching/hypersexualizing me and being complicit in the abuse I got from my dad and others. My dad just straight out raped me.) There was also other physical abuse/repression - they didn't let me go places or have certain friends because they were a ""bad influence"", and I also had to hide the fact that I was queer from them (they threatened me with conversion therapy as a teen, because I was definitely showing signs that I might be a lesbian, and although I don't remember a lot of it I believe my dad raped me to ""teach me"" what I was supposed to like.) It is all really complicated and fucked up and anyways- I left that shit and went No Contact with my family several years ago, so I don't have any family to fall back on financially or for a place to live.

So mentally I am pretty messed up. I have suffered with mental health issues since my teens and have a lot of problems with depression and anxiety. At age 35 I finally started talking to therapists about all stuff I'd been hiding (see above) and I had my first inpatient hospitalization for PTSD. I also have Bipolar Disorder that went undiagnosed for a while- finally got that diagnosis this fall. Anyhow- as I've gotten older the mental health issues are getting harder and harder to deal with and I keep having relapses, and the past year/experience with the job failure and move did NOT help anything (I've blamed myself for it and all the fallout from it, even though I can look back on it now and see differently. I have so many regrets and I wish I'd never left Vermont.) I've been hospitalized two other times- once in 2018, and most recently this past October (2019) and since then I have been in two outpatient programs. The first one didn't really help, but I'm in a new group now that is pretty good. I have another month to go on that one. I also think I'm finally on the right medications, I have a 1:1 therapist who is super relatable (and super queer!) and my doctor is fantastic. I'm also really lucky that my job had really good insurance and Short term/long term disability (which I am using right now.)

My issue is that I'm only getting about 50% of my normal pay from disability, and to be honest I'm not sure about my ability to work. I am definitely looking at less stressful jobs, but they're a pay cut, and also over the past 10 years or so I have a lot of issues concentrating, learning new things, focusing, etc. My group therapist told me that I dissociate a lot- which was not a thing I ever realized, but it's true. I dissociate constantly. I can be in the middle of a conversation and suddenly it's like a blip and I zone out and suddenly I have no idea who or what I'm talking to, or about what. It's like a computer rebooting itself randomly. I have flashbacks too, which is super disturbing and happens a lot. It's all stuff I'm working on, but it is really difficult and really exhausting. Some days feel great. The bad days wipe me out though. I have applied for permanent disability (ssi/ssd) and am waiting to hear back (it's my 2nd application, so fingers crossed.) I am also doing some part time stuff here and there and want to work when I can. I am also participating in some sex work (don't judge. Sometimes you just reach a point where that's what you do. I don't even make that much from it.)

So- I am just barely able to make my bills, and my car payment has lapsed significantly. It's been a choice between rent or car, and rent is more important at the moment since it's too cold to sleep in the car. I never updated my address with the loan company, so I was hoping they couldn't find me and that would bide me some time, but I got a letter from them today. I have a little less than a year left on it (about $10k). The hard part is- I would get a cheaper car with no payment if I had the money, but I don't. I don't think I can sell this car for what I owe. Having a car is essential to having a job (especially since I can do stuff like doordash/grubhub with it) and also making it to therapy and doctors appointments. I am also considering living in my car for a while once the weather gets warmer (my lease is up in May) to save some money up, so I really don't want to lose it.

I'm not necessarily looking for cash- if anyone has any other ideas for not losing my car that would be fine. I am about 6 months behind at this point in time, and my credit is NOT GOOD (yeah, I've made bad decisions.) I've considered debt consolidation or something, but also I don't want to get fucked with a predatory loan. In the past on other car loans, I've been able to negotiate on being 1 or 2 months behind, but this is a LOT. And I'm kicking myself, because If i could just get that money and pay it off i would not even have to worry about it.  If anyone has something to help, please tell me.

EDIT TO ADD: I'm not looking for the full 10k. I'd be open to whatever if someone wants to give. Just giving you the full picture."
,Participants Needed for Cyber Aggression Research Study," 

· Are you a female between the ages of 18 and 20?  

· Have you had an active social networking account on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, or Reddit, for at least 2 years?  

· Have you used a social networking account to engage in behaviors like excluding, teasing, harassing, or threatening someone over the past 12 months on social media or some other form of digital networking (regardless of how well you knew the person, if your identity was anonymous to them, or if you acted as a part of a group)?  

If you answered “yes” to each of these questions I am interested in scheduling a telephone interview with you to find out more about your methods, thoughts, and emotional reactions to behaving aggressively online. Your feedback will be kept confidential and is important to help mental health professionals better understand the phenomenon of cyber-aggression.

This interview should last approximately one hour.  However, additional follow-up questions may be required to elaborate on your personal experience. The information that you provide during the telephone interview will be recorded and analyzed for themes that will then be compared with other participant’s answers and entered into a comprehensive final written report that will include direct quotes to illustrate the conclusions of the study. Any identifying information (e.g. names, profile names, etc.) provided in your responses during the interview— including those of third parties— will be given a pseudonym, altered, or removed to protect your confidentiality. Also, all contact with me will only be by telephone or email to help protect your identity. An active email address and a working telephone number will be required to participate in the study and to collect your e-gift card. You are encouraged to use an email address that does not include your actual name and a telephone number that does not have a personalized voicemail message if you decide to use your own contact information and would like to remain anonymous. You will not have an opportunity to change your responses once the interview is over (unless prompted by follow-up questions) so please take your time to carefully think about your responses before answering questions. Complete and usable interviews will receive a $20 gift card to a store of your choice that offers email delivery. For example, Amazon, Best Buy, Forever 21, iTunes, Sephora, Starbucks, Target, Ulta, or Walmart. Any correspondence after the interview is over will be delivered to the preferred email address that you will provide during the prescreening process.

This study is not intended as a therapeutic intervention. Although there is a relatively low risk of harm for your participation, it is difficult to predict what emotions, thoughts, personal insights, or new understandings the interview questions might activate. If you would like to discuss any unpleasant reactions triggered by your participation in this study with a mental health professional, a list of cyber-aggression/victimization and crisis support resources will be provided to you after your completion of the interview or by sending a request, at any time, to the email address provided, below. Participants who on a rare case-by-case basis need therapeutic intervention as a result of any kind of psychological distress from participation in this study will have an opportunity to meet with a licensed clinical psychologist, Patrick Petti, Ph.D. for one free session and will be provided with referrals to other licensed mental health professionals, if necessary.

,"Computer to help me finish a coding boot camp, mine is having memory issues.","I started a boot camp to learn programming and try to get myself out of the poverty cycle. I've been doing really great with learning everything, my project reviews are always excelling. If I stay on track I'll be done with the program at the end of February, and I'm confident I'll at least be able to get a job doing helpdesk stuff for the school while I keep working on my portfolio to get a 'real' developer job.

My computer started having RAM issues (Lenovo Yoga 2). I borrowed my mom's macbook, but it has the same issues with memory. I installed linux which helps, but I'm still not able to do everything I need. For example, I can't use Zoom while also trying to have a text editor and my browser's developers tools open, I need to ration my RAM. This means that live lectures and pair programming are problematic.

I've been unemployed for a bit and recently ran out of savings. I'm in the process of moving back in with my mom and trying to find any job (I've been applying for whatever). I haven't found anything. I'm at a disadvantage: it takes me nearly twice as long to get through the coding material on average due to a learning disability, which means I need 50 - 60 hours a week to stay on track. I can't afford to do the part time program as then my tuition will no longer be deferred and I already struggle to pay for food and therapy. Although I've cancelled my weekly therapy due to money and time constraints.

I was at the end of my rope when I started, and this happened. A used Macbook would be preferable so I can learn how to use that environment and increase my odds of getting a job, full keyboard (though I can get away with a broken keyboard really, I have one I can plug into the laptop), and more than 4gb of RAM (that's what I currently have and it hasn't been enough on these older ones). I feel so damn entitled asking for a macbook for school, but it really would be the best. It doesn't need to be the newest and greatest, it just needs to be enough for me to try go down this path of being a developer. I can crawl to the finish line.

If anyone has an old one that they don't use, it would be so helpful. I can't promise to pay you back (per the rules) but I can I can promise to keep you updated on my progress and give you special thanks on the website I'm building for my nonprofit (now that I type that, I wonder if it would be ethical to ask for a loan from the board of directors since I'm building an app for it).

EDIT 1 -> clarified request for full keyboard (not actually needed, just useful)"

,Help with paying for medicine,"Edit:: just ended a long call with my pharmacy. They were able to knock out $25, which means I only need to come up with $25 more dollars.

I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis a few years ago. My doctor at that point prescribed me a med that was 100% covered by my parent's insurance (25 at the time). Now that a few years have passed, my doctor says he refuses to continue to prescribe it for me because he feels he doesn't need it. I attempted to have my local pharmacy help me out, but apparently Illinois Medicaid won't pay for it without trying other meds first. I have tried other meds, which have been costly, but none work as best as the one I was on.
My problem is, to pay for a bottle of what I need that'll last the rest of this month is very expensive. I can pay for all but $50 of it, which is why I'm asking for help.
I work as a substitute teacher, but since August I've only been contacted 3 times, which makes for a very low paycheck. That's why I can't afford the med.
My colitis is getting to the point where I need a colonoscopy every year, and Medicaid isn't happy about it. I need this med to keep my health at bay. 

Sorry for the long post. I just really need help. Thank you."
,Even $1 could help,"I am Margo. I am 20 years old. I suffer from severe clinical depression and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Because of this I can't go to school nor work right now. I am moving out soon into a system called 'sheltered living' in Belgium. This sytem helps people with mental health problems move out on their own, in either a cohousing system, a studio apartement or a regular apartement. I am doing this because living with my mom will no longer be an option. They offer professional psychological care as well as help you with administrative stuff and so on. I will be living off a living wage. I have little to no savings to get me up and running and could use some help. I will have to pay daily expenses, school expenses as well as medical bills and everything that comes with living alone with the little money I'll be getting monthly. I am still in recovery and right now am not allowed or able to work. Once I am healthy enough to work again I will start a student job. The people of sheltered living will be helping me with finances on the administrative side.

,"Desperate to get food for me, my bf, and his three kids","I'm disabled and can't work, filled out everything for assistance but still waiting. I live with my boyfriend who has 50/50 custody of his 3 kids from a previous marriage. About three weeks ago he left his job to accept an offer for a better job...but they are taking FOREVER with their hiring process. He's got his physical next week which is HOPEFULLY the last thing before he can start working. But over the weeks without working we've really come onto tough times. Things will be fine once he starts working, but right now we can't afford food for us, the kids, or our pets. That's my biggest concern. The bills can be sorted out after he starts working, even if it means being without stuff for awhile. The food bank near us is only open like 3 hours a week and we accidentally missed it. 

I just want a little help with food. Once he starts working we will forward the help we received to others on this sub in need."

In the meantime I have been volunteering with under privileged sports teams across my area and city (about 6/7 different teams) ranging from youth teams all the way up to adult team that are under funded or lacking basic health needs, currently I’m in employed and don’t receive payment for helping as it goes against my purpose (teams lack money so I wouldn’t dare expect a monetary value from them) 

I’ve made an amazon wish list (subject to change) of basic stuff I need or will aid in player or person recovery, these things will be more than hugely beneficial towards helping others and I hope someone, anyone can help. Thank you all for taking the time and I hope you all have a great 2020

,I don't know what else to do right now,"Just when you think you're starting to do good, and things are looking it something always slaps you back down to the bottom again. My name is Denise and I've cooked my last roll of ground beef, I have just about enough milk for the kiddo to have some milk tomorrow. I just recently lost my job, I start a new one on Monday so that's good. But right before I lost my job my car had an unexpected issue with it and was in the shop from the middle of December until January 2nd because I was waiting for my last paycheck to come in.

But now my bills are piling up and I don't have any money for groceries. I'm laying next to my son trying to get him to sleep and my mind is all over the place. I have no family I can ask for help, my friends aren't in any positions to be able to help. The dark black hole of depression has almost consumed me fully.

I know this sounds like a sob story, and I'm really anxious about even posting this. I've come so far from where I was without needing help and I feel so shameful asking for it now. I am at my lowest point feeling my weakest right now. But to be able to stabilize until I get my paycheck (which I will only be getting paid training for the first 2 weeks, I go full time afterward) I need $500.

My GF has been in and out of the hospital for the last year for a variety of things, including mental illness.  We finally have some solid diagnoses, and part of working through her symptoms is using various coping mechanisms.  One coping mechanism she used and loved in the hospital is sketching and coloring on an iPad using (I think) Procreate.

I’m asking if anyone has first generation pencil maybe collecting dust in a drawer, or even if it’s damaged, or any of the cheaper “Apple Pencil alternatives”, anything that will let her use procreate, maybe you would like to and can help her.   Even if the battery doesn’t last long or something, missing parts, I’ll do anything I can to fix it for her.

**About Me:** My name is Stephen, I'm 32 and working on getting my Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science here in Washington State. I grew up with some mental disabilities that have made work difficult to maintain, and so in 2015 I managed to get together enough money to start going to community college and work towards a Bachelor's degree. I finished my Associate's degree in 2018, transferred my credits, and now I'm a senior at a local 4-year university. Unfortunately, many of the grants and scholarships I've relied on are running out and I'm having to take out hefty student loans in order to finish off the last year of my degree. My disabilities are severe enough that I'm not capable of going to school and working at the same time, and in hopes of keeping my student loan debts down, I've turned to GoFundMe and Reddit.

**Where's the donations going?** The money I receive will go towards paying for tuition, textbooks, transportation, and living expenses while I'm attending college. The cost to finish my degree is expected to be around $20,000. I'm hoping to get enough to make up the difference from my scholarships and grants. Any funds leftover will go towards paying down my student loans.

**How can you help?** The easiest way you can help me is by donating directly to me at my  [**ABLE Savings**](http://www.sumday.com/gift/washington-able/ftoS4zYENki8j3N4f_Wkeg) account. ABLE is a federal and state-run program designed to allow disabled low-income people a chance to save money for needed expenses without losing their welfare benefits such as Social Security or SNAP food stamps. Donating directly to my ABLE account will not be counted against me when it comes to welfare services such as disability, Social Security, or Public Housing Assistance. Donations to GoFundMe also help; I do post updates on there at major points, I just posted about completing this semester *(two A's, an A-, and a B+!).* I just prefer the ABLE account because GoFundMe can be counted as income by the government and my landlady if conditions are just right.

I have his full name but after doing some googling I'm not able to find any way to legally get this information.

I know the van was auctioned off but I don't know where.

​

I believe he tried to sell it here  [http://www.2040-cars.com/Volkswagen/Bus-Vanagon/1970-volkswagen-westfalia-bus-daily-driver-project-469700/](http://www.2040-cars.com/Volkswagen/Bus-Vanagon/1970-volkswagen-westfalia-bus-daily-driver-project-469700/) 

​

but the website gives an error when trying to contact the person. 

​

The VIN number on the website also seems incomplete.

Luckily the listing was in the town I grew up in and I try to drive around and locate it but I haven't had luck so far.

Edit: so I was able to find the person that purchased the vehicle here in town but sadly they no longer lived at the address and I was told they moved out of state.

They sold the van before they moved to someone for a Harley, that person fixed it up and then sold it to someone in LA. No one is able to give me any names or phone numbers or any other information so I have more information but none of the helpful sadly. 

I stopped by the DMV just to double check and they gave me the same information as before.

Just so everyone is clear the vehicle that I mentioned in the link, I believe that is my grandfather's car. So that license plate and van and information should be accurate I just don't have anything I can do with that information."
,New to this group but wanna offer an open ear,hey guys I know it's the beginning of the year and I know some of yall are lonely but if anybody out there needs an opening here some advice I'm here
,In need of help...,"I retired from the active duty Army, and followed my husband to South Dakota, where he wanted to continue going to school. After a series of terrible events, including my father in laws suicide and my husband’s repeated inability to be faithful, we decided to end our marriage. Because we were living in my mother in laws home, we (my oldest three children and I) were told to leave. With my ex husband receiving almost half of my retirement and disability each month, he’s managed to continue his college education, where I have had to postpone finishing my degree, working and supporting the children. Needless to say, it was catching up to me and with the oldest two having moved on to college and work, my 12 year old daughter and I made the decision to move to Oklahoma with my parents and sister so I could work on getting ourselves back together and on our feet. The environment we are in is completely toxic for my daughter. We don’t have a room, so we both sleep in the living room and my daughters lack of privacy is wearing on her...she’s picked on constantly by my parents and my sister and it kills me to watch her suffer through no fault of her own. If I try to stand up for her, it only gets worse. She is homeschooled, so the only time she’s out of the house is when she’s out taking care of my parents animals. My truck broke down shortly after getting here so we are at the mercy of my parents when it comes to looking for work or even going to church. I’ve found a place that will be perfect for both of us, back in South Dakota, close to her siblings and friends. I have a job lined up that is within walking distance of the house. We need a place of our own to get back to normal and start healing from the hell the last two years have been...I do have a little money saved up, but everything that my parents know about has gone into their pockets since we’ve been here...I have never been a person who could ask for help, but I am swallowing my pride and humbly asking for help with the rest of our deposit and to get back to where we have somewhat of a support system. Thank you for your consideration. 💛"
,Please help my friend get her independence back!,"https://fundrazr.com/51bW7d?ref=ab_28iEy1


For someone who once was fully independent to become reliant on other people for basic tasks is a life-changing series of events.

To have multiple reasons for that loss to happen at the same time is even more devastating.

Hi there! My name is Kayleigh. I am 26 years old, and I live with multiple physical and emotional disabilities. The big thing is that all of my medical and mental health providers believe that a service dog would be one of the absolute best things to occur in my life. I just need your help to get there.

There are many service dog non-profits out there, with 5+ year waitlists and very narrow training specialties. I have found a breeder and trainer that are willing to train a dog for multiple disabilities and with a much, much shorter wait time. Time is of the essence for myself right now, as my mental health is suffering from my lack of independence.

I will go into further details about what I hope the service dog can help me with later, but the big ones are: balance, retrieving and PTSD assistance.

The breeder I am looking at sets the price of a service dog temperament puppy with basic training at $4,000. All of their puppies are evaluated at 8 weeks of age by their highly reputable trainer before starting the service dog training. I am still waiting to hear back on exactly how much the further training costs, but that's something I can worry about once I have the puppers!

Now, that number may seem daunting, but it really isn't when you take into account the HUMONGOUS benefit a service dog would have on my life. Even just the price of a cup of coffee puts me so much closer to gaining that independence back that I miss so badly. Please, take a pass on your morning latte, hit the donate and share buttons, and help me make this dream a reality!"
,[request] USB headset you dont want/use,"hello, i was wondering if anyone has a used usb headset that they wouldnt mind letting go of? i work on mturk but i recently and luckily got another online job of search quality evaluator with sykes and not appen or lionbridge. they require a headset for their training. this was okay until they said it can only be a usb headset. whenever i record things for working online i use earbuds with the mic attached but this wasnt allowed. my little brother had a headset with a 2.5 mm jack but i msged the recruited and she also said this wouldnt work and she said it ""creates issues with their system."" so i am wondering if anyone can send me a usb headset lying around that they dont use. normally i would just get this myself and try to budget but unfortunately work has been soooo slow and low because of the holidays. right before christmas through now is almost like watching paint dry. i have around 1 week before i start but i am also behind on earning money for two bills because of the slow holiday as well. i can understand if this is deemed unworthy but i have to try. i also live in texas. thanks for reading."

The past months have been really hard. 

I maxed out my credit card on emergency travel to look after my mum after she had a stroke, which basically took Christmas from me. 
She got diagnosed with epilepsy too and has had three seizures since, so almost all my money has gone on visiting her (as she can no longer drive) and has done into a suicidal depressive episode.

Because of this my finances have gone to hell. I’ve been running around looking after everyone else but now we’re at the bottom of the barrel and I don’t know how to pay the bills I have left.

I’m not asking for anything specific, but if anyone could spare some kindness our way I’d really appreciate it. I have paypal."
,Need help finding the name and/or video of an aninated childrens story I used to watch when I was a kid,"When I was a kid, I had a huge collection of childrens animated stories on dvd's. I don't really remember all of the stories, but I do partially remember one in particular. (Hopefully I get some details right)

It starts with this ""princess""  sitting in a garden. As she slowly picks up flowers, she hears an animal wailing for help. She runs to where she heard the screams and sees a bird fighting with a snake. The bird is defending its nest while the snake is trying to eat the eggs. The princess intervenes and saves the bird and its eggs. They both part ways.

As the story progresses, it is indicated that the princess lives in a small town all by herself. It is explained that in the middle of this town, there is a huge bell (remember this, as it is crucial to understand the ending of the story). It is also explained that there is a castle nearby, and apparently a ""beast"" resides inside it.

After some time, this princess is somehow captured by a beast and is locked inside the castle. The princess speaks with the beast and tries to understand why he wont set her free. The beast, in an attempt to mock her, makes a deal with her. He states: ""If the bell in the middle of the town strikes before sundown, you will be set free"". (The beast knows full well that the town is isolated and that she is the only one living in it).

To his amazement, a couple of minutes before sundown, the bell strikes. The beast, although furious, keeps his promise and lets her go.
The princess rushes to the bell, only to find the bird she had previously saved laying dead. The bird had sacrificed itself by flying straight into the bell. 

She picks it up, crying her heart out. Not a moment later a ray of light shines from the sky, focusing on the dead bird. Its spirit appears and flies gracefully into the heavens. The princess looks up, as the birds spirit slowly vanishes as it flies away.

If any of you know the name of the story or the name of the dvd collection that it is featured in, that would be amazing!

PS: I forgot to add that my native language is spanish and I am from Puerto Rico. I don't remember if the dvd's were originally in english or in spanish"

,Homeless/unemployed and in an Airbnb for the next month. Need food for the next 3-4 weeks or so.,"Posting this on here since I’m unable to post on Food_Pantry due to the 90 day charitable subreddit posting rule. I recently became homeless, and I’m in an AirBNB being paid for by a longtime online friend from this site, who’s eventually going to let me room with him once I’m able to make some income (unemployed rn), but he can’t send me much in the way of food right now, nor do I want him to, as I think he’s doing enough to help me. Neither can my host, aside from a meal he sent me last night, as he has some financial amends he needs to take care of (?). Aside from that, I lived off of a Domino’s pizza I got on here for half of this week. 

Why I’m currently unemployed: I’m currently disabled from very poor mental health (working on it), and all I can do is freelance writing and online work. My laptop died last spring, had to move back in with my parents for a few months, desperately posted on here last November about my situation and why I’m unemployed, and asked for an old laptop that isn’t used much anymore. I had someone offer me one, but it broke right before she was going to ship it, so she generously offered to buy me a cheap Chromebook at some point. Unfortunately, money has been tight on her end, so I’m trying to contact someone else who offered, who lost the charger to their laptop, so the other person who’s struggling a little doesn’t have to spend money. But this other person seemingly hasn’t been on Reddit in a while. Because of the delay, I haven’t been able to resume my online work. As a result of that, my family kicked me out after Christmas, so that’s why I’m homeless. They were very strict about it. Luckily, my friend is getting a new place sometime next month, and he will help out if I can pitch in around 25% of his rent - which I should be able to do with freelance writing. 

Because of this situation, I need some food for the next 3-4 weeks or so, since I’m expecting a laptop by the end of the month - although it’s not guaranteed. I’m aiming for 2 meals a day: breakfast, and lunch/dinner, along with some coffee and stuff to help me focus.

Essentials: 

Coffee and sugar. 

Breakfast: everything bagels w/ vegetable/chive cream cheese; cinnamon raisin w/ blueberry/brown sugar cream cheese

Lunch/dinner: rice, pasta/ramen; sauces like bbq, Japanese steak sauce; frozen veggies

Snacks: Triscuits, pop tarts

Spices and seasoning like chili powder, red pepper, etc.

I’m stuck with tap water, so I added a 24 pack of Coca Cola and some bottled water.

[Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/lists/shared/8ce11ec0-7d33-423c-bdf1-651a0f2c6681)

I hope it’s not too expensive, I put this together in a hurry. 

I would also request some type of tracking number if possible, so I can stay on top of my package. My host told me the area has been seeing an uptick in crime recently, so I’m concerned about the possible event of having a package stolen. So, just in case.

If anyone can help me out it would be **immensely** appreciated!"
,Could anyone help me out with a little food.,Does anyone have a Uber coupon or anyway to help me out with a little food? I am between paychex being that I just started working.

,What's the best way to monetize my passion?,"For some background: I'm 20 now and I've been programming for about 6 or 7 years. I love programming ever since the day i started. I made a bunch of different utility programs and games over the years, nothing too big and most of them i didn't even finish, it was just for the fun making it.

Well that changed about 2 years ago when i started working on an operating system, not knowing anything about the topic. I spent literal weeks reading up on the theory and implementation till i got something working and since then the project has been growing and growing in complexity, to the point where it seems like a lifelong project of sorts.

I'm incredibly happy with what i have planned, i honestly think i have some really interesting new ideas and concepts for the OS and the ecosystem but I'm not really sure if and how i can monetize this project that is so dear to me.

I thought about crowdfunding, but I'm relatively certain that my target audience of power users is not really big enough for that. Same goes for streaming the development, plus I'm not really the entertainer type.

After thinking about this for a long time, i still have no idea on how to earn money doing what i love. I appreciate any ideas you guys might have on how i could pull it off.

If you read this far, thank you for taking the time and happy new year to you :)"
,Need help fixing/replacing computer,"I was extremely sick the past few days and during that time i decided to work on something's on my computer for commissions.. Well i ended up vomiting on it while half asleep.

I know I'm probably asking way too much but any help paying would be appreciated greatly as things are really tight and losing my side commissions will be a huge loss towards rent and bills."
,Stranded in Norway on a three month visa that's set to expire soon. I freelance and hit a wall. Now I am trying to find work in USA. I have no money and my family here doesn't have the means to send me back.,"Hi everyone, I hate having to ask for assistance, but here I am.

After graduating from university, I received a scholarship from the US State Department to study Arabic. This enabled me to relocate to a country in the Middle East temporarily to study the language. I have been freelancing for a few years in IT, which during a good month can earn decent money but it is necessary to account for inevitable bad months. This worked while I was in the Middle East because I was in an affordable country. I have family here in Norway, where I live now after leaving the Middle East. Sadly, I have had a few terrible months and haven't found projects. Some people can diversify their income successfully. I however, am not one of those people. I have found this lifestyle to be incredibly unsustainable in the long term. It worked for awhile, and I had a good few years, but now I'm trapped abroad without a permit to work in Norway and no ability to return back home. I've been in Norway for a little while with extended family members. I do not have the option to live with my parents in USA due to an abusive household. There is very limited contact between my family here and my parents.While Norway is a rich country, my family here is small and not loaded with the money needed to enable my return. Norway's not exactly the worst place to feel trapped in, but my visa is set to expire in a month, and per schengen laws, I have to be out of Schengen for three months before returning. I can't just go to a neighboring country for a day and come back to continuously extend my visa. I am asking for funds to help me get back to Oregon. Starting now, I'm looking around to housing assistance and food stamps just to get me on my feet until I find work. I've started the job search already, and have had a few interviews. Things are moving at a snail's pace because of Christmas. I'll probably hear back within the next few weeks, but at any rate I'll need help getting back home. At this point I'm willing to do anything until I find a career in my particular field.

I made a [gofundme](https://www.gofundme.com/f/i-am-stranded-in-norway-and-need-to-return-to-usa?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1). Any little bit helps me a lot. I am a little bit scared about the next few months if I don't square away a job in USA, which is why I'm asking for assistance now as it'll be a lot easier to find a career and relocate once I'm on American soil than being stuck here."

,"My old friend returned, however, our time together today only made me sadder than when they were gone.","I could really use some help with some friendship advice, it would be really nice if I could have someone to talk to about an experience I had with an old friend today.

Essentially, my old friend I met on discord a few years ago came back yesterday from a year-long break from media. About 5 months into that period, I sent them a message explaining how much I missed them, as we used to talk daily and were very close. Yesterday, they finally came back, and we ended up planning to play a video game together. However, when we played today, they spent most of the time talking with someone else in the house, leaving me to sit there in the call for 10 or so minutes at a time to listen to them laugh and joke with someone else. After a bit they headed off, and they way they said they ‘enjoyed hanging out with me’ sounded rushed and sarcastic before they logged out. I know we are just online friends, but I felt really hurt by how they treated me today- especially since I’ve known them for years. We had a plan and everything, and I was really excited to talk and play with my friend again, but they seemed very distant. 

I’m not asking for sympathy or anything , I’d really just like some help with what I should do. Should I tell them how I feel? Let it slide? I really enjoy this persons company, and today’s experience was not what I expected from my old friend. I would appreciate all advice on what I should do, as I am a bit stuck. Thank you."
,How can I[20] help my father[56] get back into the job market?,"My father has been working in the printing field as a mid-level manager for his company for about 30 years. He's in his mid-50's, and does very well in his position. He's a phenomenal manager, he does great work for his company, and his bosses comes to him specifically with issues they're having because they know he will get it sorted out. The only problem with this is that his company hasn't been kind in return. It has been years since he's received a cost-of-living raise, the company cut his pension, the company's stock price got so low that it was taken off the NASDAQ, the company is shutting down more and more manufacturing plants each year, and they recently shut down one of the departments my father manages because there simply wasn't enough demand to justify its cost.

For years my family and I have encouraged him to look into other jobs as we've watched his company deteriorate, and he agrees with us that he should be looking into other opportunities. He has a degree in communications from a good university, as well as \~30 years of managerial experience, but he's not only stubborn and from a generation build on company loyalty, he's also afraid of getting back into the job search. I really want to be able to help him find a new position at a more stable company, but I don't know how to address the topic with him. If you have any advice for me about how to approach him, what tools he can use to get back into the job hunt, or how he can prepare to be an older worker in a much younger job market, I would greatly appreciate your assistance."

,"[REQUEST] Huion H610 Pro V2 (Drawing Tablet, $45)"," Hello everyone! How was your holiday season? I hope it went well!

Today I am requesting the Huion H610 Pro V2 tablet. Getting into drawing has been a thing I've been debating for a while, but I never had the chance to actually buy a tablet due to financial issues. Getting into digital art has even become a New Year's Resolution of mine that I wanted to fulfill. I've done some traditional sketching in a notebook but I realized that soon enough just the cost of different pencils would start to greatly outcost just spending the $50\~ on a tablet that I don't have to keep buying materials for. Paying for pencils, paper, erasers, and other materials really start to add up.

The reason I am asking for this particular model is because first of all it's one of the cheapest tablets, but also one of the biggest for it's price range. There are other tablets a few dollars cheaper but I really think for the few more extra dollars it would really help in terms of accuracy when drawing. Plus it is one of the few tablets that actually have a ""lifted"" design instead of a flat one which would definitely make it easier on the wrists when drawing. Another huge factor is how many programmable buttons it has. Most tablets around this price range only have around 4, but this one has 8, plus 16 more ""soft keys"" that would make drawing more accessible for me.

An added bonus for it is that it also works with Android phones. I've looked at the list of models that it supports and luckily it also works with my phone so I could also potentially use the tablet whenever I'm not home.

I can't afford the tablet myself at all. I am currently jobless with no way to currently make some money (I live with my parents out in a rural area, away from town with no public transportation). I was thinking of asking it for Christmas but my parents are also deep in financial trouble and are even filing for bankruptcy currently. We didn't really give gifts for Christmas because of this so I didn't set any expectations and didn't ask them for it. (We still enjoyed a delicious Christmas dinner though!)

Not being able to afford it is also a key point I wanted to discuss. I have many art friends that sell their own art, lots of people will commission them for art and it's crazy how much people can sell it for. Most of my friends sell pieces for around $20 at their lowest. I wanted to work on my hobby and potentially start blossoming it into a way I can pay for things I need like my friends do. With traditional pencil sketching there isn't really much you can do to sell it without the use of a scanner unfortunately.

This is the tablet in question. $50 but it says I have a coupon for it which makes it $45 after taxes. I'm not sure if this is a Prime only deal or what. [https://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Drawing-Function-Battery-Free-Pressure/dp/B07DPC98DT/](https://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Drawing-Function-Battery-Free-Pressure/dp/B07DPC98DT/)  
I live in the United States so I believe any shipping would also be free.  


I would like to thank you for reading, even if you don't plan on fulfilling this request. I hope all of you have a wonderful weekend!"

,[REQ] pocket money for meals,"Fulfilled by someone from Discord.

The latest update in my ongoing saga of being homeless in Montreal: my welfare application is active, and I have a meeting for that on January 8. My social worker is confident that the application will be approved, and that I'll see some money coming to me by the end of the month. I'm not as confident as him, but he probably knows better than me, so we'll see.

In the meantime, I'm getting a good supper each night that I go to the shelter, and I get a ""breakfast"" of toast and coffee in the morning, but I'd still like to have a decent lunch now and then. I know I've made a lot of these requests, and for the last 2 months I've been doing everything I'm told to do in order to get myself out of this hole, but the system is a slow beast, and I'm hungry today. I can provide my email in DM for sending money via paypal, or Starbucks gift cards.

Long-term, I've come to accept that staying in Montreal is no longer sustainable for me, and I'll be making a ""moon shot"" post about helping me relocate, either tomorrow or later today."
,"Sorry, no money to help but maybe some helpful advice for those struggling!","I've been working from home for years now. I started out at Teletech which was fairly easy to get due to having customer service experience. [Ratracerebellion.com](https://Ratracerebellion.com) lists legit work from home jobs on a daily basis. Some good ones that are always hiring are Sykes, Conduent, Concentrix, Appen and Lionbridge. Just thought I'd throw this out there in case it can help others! Pretty sure Appen and Lionbridge don't care if you have work at home experience.

Edited to add some others I’ve thought of and they hire depending on state and country. It varies with all of them so unfortunately I don’t know where they hire for sure.

Sutherland global, Working Solutions, Sitel, Transcom, Teleperformance, iSoftstone, Support.com, Xerox

I’ve not worked for most of these companies I just can vouch that they are legitimate.  It can take some time and lots of applications but that’s how I did it.

Right now it’s tax season and a lot of these companies are looking for customer service reps and that’s how I got my foot in the door with a work at home job. Hopefully, the rest of you can do the same.

Good Luck!

I have $20 but it isn't enough to get to the airport) For the first time in months I see a glimmer of hope and it's like  I'm trying my best to ""hulk out"" of a shirt made of darkness and I can finally see the finish line. 

If anyone can help me out, it would be such a huge thing for me. I am so ready to kick this and get my life back."
,Any help would be amazing,"My fiance and I are about to be homeless due to circumstances beyond our control. We live in the Wilkes Barre PA area and we are asking if there are any kind people of Reddit we could stay with for a week until I can save the $600 i need to get into a hotel you rent monthly. I have a temp job next week making $180 a day so I should be able to have the money for the hotel by the end of the week. I just don't know what we are going to do until then.

Edit: to add to the story, we were living with her brother and we were giving him more than enough money for rent and bills. Flash forward 4 months and we find out he hasn't been paying rent this whole time and we have no idea where our money went. So we got evicted and of course he has a place to stay but we're left literally and figuratively in the cold. We have a hotel room til Saturday morning but then we're screwed"
,Raising Money for Cat's Mouth Surgery,"Last winter, the sweetest stray turned up on our porch. It was way below freezing, so my brother and I took him in and bonded immediately. Despite his battle scars from a long life on the streets, he is intensely affectionate and kind. We have been working with a vet to get rid of his respiratory infection, skin infection, worms, etc (all the things that you would expect of a stray). Unfortunately, most of his teeth are rotting/covered in plaque, and he needs surgery to remove his teeth.

Hobbes is fed and treated like a king, but this unexpected cost is not possible right now. The surgery is estimated to cost $600-$800 and my brother and I are in no place to be able to spend that kind of money, as we're struggling every month just to pay our bills. It feels weird to be asking for financial help, but he's become part of the family and we want him to live a long and comfortable life.

All of the money raised will go directly to the vet bill and if there's any extra it will be donated to our local animal shelter.

,Looking for financial advice,"So I have been put in a situation I never thought I’d be in. I just left a job of 10+ years, making $50,000 a year or so. I was more or less asked to leave, but that’s not the point.

I am starting a business, slowly getting contracts signed and each one makes me a little more money a month. But for the next month or so, I have 0 money. How do I handle this stress. It’s not “I have money to pay bills and nothing more” or “I have money to pay for food and nothing more”, it’s “I have no money”

I will scrap by, but it’s the stress and anxiety and the lack of motivation to even get out of bed right now that’s making me worried.

Help

Edit: Was advised to give a bit of backstory to why I left. I moved from Atlanta to Massachusetts to be second in command at a Chick-fil-A back in 2017. We’ve been up in sales, getting all the awards, making the owner quite a bit of money. Working 40-60 hours a week, and still working when I get home by answering phone calls and texts from leaders. In November of 2019, apparently he found someone who can do my job, by cheaper. An outside hire, someone who has never worked at a chick fil a before, but he feels they can do just as good. So he told me to plan my exit. I’ve had a business plan building up for a while, just wasn’t ready to implement it yet. Now I’m having to implement it without the time I expected, or the funds.

PM me if you want to ask about the business."
,Need help getting back home,I’ve been in a relationship with a recovering alcoholic that has relapsed. The original plan was to save what I can make between now and March and the two of us were going to move back to my home state in March but now things have changed and the situation is volatile. The job I was going to work at between now and then hasn’t started yet and I have no funds at all. I need to leave ASAP and my car isn’t exactly up to par. A couple of bad tires and needs at the very least an oil change. It’s an old car but good on gas so it shouldn’t take all that much in gas to get there. I’m taking a dog and 2 cats and I don’t want to run out of gas with them in the car. I have no idea how much I need.. tires and oil change shouldn’t be more than 250. And gas would probably be under 200. Whatever I can get together I’ll make it work even if I don’t do the tires or the oil change and only have gas.
,I made a mistake,"So, I accidentally dinged a door when I parked in a lot. the ding was barely noticeable, but nevertheless, I talked to the owner and took responsibility. When they went to the shop to get it fixed, they said it would cost 1.2k dollars USD. I'm practically broke right now, I don't want money, just support. What should I do?

\*edit: for those of you who were wondering, the shop the owners of the car took it to is a shop I go to all the time. I trust them."
,"Help finding my brother an affordable apartment in Portsmouth, Fratton, UK","Hi all. I hope this post doesn’t break any rules although I don’t think it will.

Im looking for someone who might be able to help my brother. He needs to move to Portsmouth and is struggling a lot finding an apartment that he can afford that allows his sweet dog to stay with him. 

He would be living with his girlfriend and his dog. He is searching for a job at the moment and the flat needs to be somewhere near Fratton so that his girlfriend can keep her part time job. She is unable to work more hours due to an illness. 

I really want to help him find somewhere to live. Where he is right now is just deplorable conditions and I hate that I am not able to help him because I live abroad and struggling myself.

,I don't feel safe living with my parents anymore,"F/20 VA

I don't feel safe living with my parents anymore. Ever since November of last year, they have been threatening me over my earnings from my retail job, and my grades in community college. I've been trying to save for the next semester but all of my earnings have to go into a shared account which gets used for my used car which is always breaking down. The cost often comes out to $500 which leads to my account getting cleaned out and the remaining coming out of their account. I'm always being screamed at and being called names I really don't want to repeat here. I have ADHD and it's often an uphill struggle to get school work done with good grades, but they just think it's me being lazy and just not wanting to get work done. They would rather believe that I'm a lazy directionless slut that wants to mooch off of them for the rest of my life. I just want to be successful. I just want to get an education so I can have the life I've always dreamed of. There was an argument again tonight and my Dad threw my old metal phone at me and it hit me in the face. I need to leave but I have nowhere to go. My friends can't let me stay over, they won't let me take my car and it's not reliable, and the shelters near me don't have space available. They will kick me out in a few days and I'm panicking."

,"I need a little help. Got fucked over today, and yesterday.","So I’ve been on a rough journey since the start of december. Dad kicked me out, i drank alcohol at his house, he wasn’t okay with that. I found a place to live luckily. Christmas meant money was super stretched, i got everyone gifts though. i used my xmas present money to pay rent, partly by trading in gift cards for cash online. I’m broke af, but i’m surviving. Yesterday i lost $40 i was supposed to give to my roommate. I dug through trash for an hour to find it, but i didn’t. Today i figured i could trade a $100 Amazon gift card i got for xmas for cash to pay back my roommate and pay for other things. I tried to trade it here on reddit, and i got scammed. The guy had a username he made meant to mimic someone else’s, and linked me to their feedback page which made me think they were legit. i’ll never fall for that again, but now i’ve lost my $100 amazon card in a crucial time. i could have used that money for groceries and gas. i’m bumming food tonight now. 

if anyone can help, i’d appreciate it. even just someone to talk to would mean a lot to me."

,"[REQUEST] Long Post, I Need Assistance To Help My Family. Please Help If You Can.","I am not sure where to begin but here it goes. I have not seen my fathers side of the family in a long time. He was not a good person and, long story made short, I helped the police put him in prison for a long time. After a very unfortunate death on that side of the family I made a trip to visit them over the holiday season. 

My Grandmother, Aunt, Cousin and his two children along with a friend of his are all living in a one bedroom mobile home. No one there is working and the youngest two there are a ten year old boy and a four year old little girl. The others are all adults. They are all suffering from crippling depression (Aunt), Kidney Failure and Dialysis (Older Cousin) and COPD (Grandma). I do not look for them to live past 2020 and the children living there are suffering terribly. I have to help my baby cousins, whom I have just recently met. I feel so terrible for not knowing about this sooner.

The worst parts of their living conditions are that they do not have a working toilet, everyone in the house has scabies and there is no treatment and the kids have no place to sleep. Not to mention that they do not have any food and have not been enrolled in school. I bought what I could before I departed a few days ago. I have called the authorities and spoken with other family members. I don't know what the best thing to do is. My vision is to obtain a steady place and job and take these children in and give them a place to grow in a healthy environment. I am in no way ready for this as fast as they need it but I am working hard at accomplishing this for them. I just need some help. I figured this would be worth a shot even if all I receive are prayers and motivation. I have to help these poor babies. 

I know its unreasonable to ask strangers on the internet to help me rent a place but I did come up with a list of things that would really help me get started in the right direction:

\-Legal Advice and Assistance to Remove them from the home and get them into my custody as quickly as possible.

\-Health Insurance for the Children (Age 10 & 4 in Lucedale, MS)

\-Food Assistance (Walmart Gift Cards, Food Delivery Anything to Feed Them Fast)

\-Gift Cards to Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy & Walmart

\-Air BnB or Hotel Gift Cards (For me to be able to stay closer to them)

\-Uber/Lyft Credits (I Currently Don't Have Transportation) 

\-Any Donation, Prayer or Advice/Support

,18F Need Help Affording Doctor’s Appointment Again,"

Hi, the link to my original post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/ef8vw4/need_help_affording_a_doctors_appointment/


 I was able to come across the money through my sister who lent it to me but that was all she was capable of giving (nonetheless, it was enough so I marked the original post as fulfilled). However, I got an overdraft fee on my bank account because the Robinhood app (which someone recommended to me after my last post) withdrew from my savings account before the money from my sister transferred. I only need $25 to be able to afford the appointment again. Once again, I’m not asking for the full amount as any sort of donation would be extremely helpful. I will also provide proof that any money given went towards the doctors appointment. Also any advice on ways I could get quick cash would be helpful. (I am actively looking for a job it’s just a little difficult due to my family situation and lack of car). Thank you so much.

My 7th grade class' reading level is between 2nd and 6th grade and I would love to be able to provide more books that interest my students. They love series books and get hooked on graphic novels. I have driven around to thrift stores and bought as many books second-hand as I can buy on my budget.

Can I humbly request that you consider making a small donation? Or, if you are not able to, that you consider sharing our classroom's Donorschoose project? It would help out my students so much!

,Using up the last of my fight to seek help about depression and fragile mental health,"I'm 29 years old, Male. Literally for as long as I can remember I've been battling depression and crippling anxiety with everything in me. To begin with and for years I fought it alone.. Then I decided to speak out about it in order to get professional help. I was given people to speak to, medication to take, nothing has worked for very long. 

I managed to pull myself out of the dumps and get a job a couple months back then that ended on the 27th of December just past and I've spiralled way down and I've been having flashing thoughts of suicide. I've looked into planning it but I keep coming back to the same thought... I don't have the balls to do it yet. I feel like I have nothing left to offer this world and anyone I talk to seems to just be reading from a script of things depressed people want to hear.

I haven't moved from my bed besides to cook up whatever I had left in my cupboards. I've been ignoring any messages I get. I've completely given up on hygiene since the 27th. Haven't showered once..

I need help with my rabbits vet bills, it is £642 and another £200ish for her second surgery to get her teeth removed at the roots as they are over growing way too quickly so they need to be removed so she isn’t in pain, she’s only eating pellets and greens and it’s really important for rabbits to eat hay so I’m hoping when she goes for the second surgery she can eat again.

,Help save Pom Pom,"

https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-pompom

""Hello and thank you for taking the time to read this.

I was hoping you could help us. Last year we took in a stray cat that had been living in our neighbourhood for a few months. We quickly grew to love her and decided to keep her. My daughter named her PomPom. She was in rough shape however; she had lost part of her tail, had fleas and a severe ear infection.

Everything was treated and resolved - except her ear. We began antibiotics but were informed that the problem was more complicated than expected. PomPom's ear infection was due to a polyp in her ear which would require surgery. We were given a rough estimate of ""upwards of $3000"". I decided to continue with the antibiotics and keep my fingers crossed that that would be enough. It wasn't. The polyp has continued to grow and is now about the size of a golfball. The infection runs rampant, she scratches at it and blood and puss ooze out; she shakes her head and splatters the walls and furniture. Despite the pain and obvious discomfort she is still the sweetest most affectionate cat ever.

I decided to see a vet in QC (Hull Veterinary Clinic) hoping that the surgery would be more affordable there. However the closest place in QC they could refer me to was in Montreal at a total cost of approx $3700 including a CT scan (see attached estimate). I'm at a loss for what to do. We knew we were doing the right thing by giving a stray a home but it breaks my heart to see her suffering knowing I can't fix it.

I'm reaching out to the community in the hopes of raising funds toward the CT scan and surgery. Any help toward saving this sweet, affectionate kitty would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time."""

,Need help with court ordered payment.,"Hey, everyone. I'm here today to ask for assistance of a court ordered payment. I received a letter in the mail from a lawyer, whom I have already seen in court last year, to have another hearing on the 23rd of January for the remainder of my balance ($860). I simply have just been forgetful in going to pay him, probably because I have moved in the last 3 months and tending to my rent/house upkeep has distracted me from going to pay them. They also have not contacted me at all regarding me being late, so I just got this letter in the mail.

They are wanting to garnish my wages after the hearing, but I don't want them to do that. I am afraid that my employer will want to terminate me because I have already have had debt collectors calling them to garnish my wages for student loans. I just want to pay it off before then, and settle this outside of court. I understand if nobody would like to help, I got myself in this situation. But literally any dollar amount, even small, would help. I plan on putting all of my next few paychecks towards this, but I still would need a couple extra dollars just for basic needs.

Oh, and also I have 2 doctors appointments this month that will probably end up costing me ~120 dollars after co-pays and medication refills. So that is also throwing me for a loop. Really wish I could just ask /r/borrow but I don't have enough Karma to post there. I hate just asking for money.

If anyone could help me that would be greatly appreciated. Like I said, any dollar amount would help tremendously. I am sorry to post here because of my incompetence, but this is my last ditch effort. Thanks everyone, and hope you all have a Happy New Year."
,It’s been a rough week. Even a few bucks would help.,"Hey all. I don’t usually ask for help but this week I’ve had to. On Monday, my car which had had a soft rattling noise that I thought was a loose muffler, died on me. Turns out that I had a hole in my oil pan which caused the engine to over heat and I then threw a rod. I’ve not yet heard from Kia as to whether a recall on a  sensor  will cover the repair but in addition to that, payroll was done incorrectly sending only half my check and there will be a delay in when the remaining is deposited into my account. With having to pay for ride shares and rental car, the few quarters I’ve had in my account have been depleted. I was able to ask my brother to loan me some cash but I don’t have the remaining $350 for my rent which is due tomorrow. Should my car not be covered by Kia, as I’m out of the warranty by 13,000 miles, my dad has offered to put the repair bill on his emergency credit card for me to pay back later. I know that I’m imposing even with that but it’s the first time I’ve had to ask my dad for money since becoming an adult. Any little bit would help and I would appreciate even sincere words of encouragement because life is rough right now."
,Please help me with groceries for me and my 4 babies,"I was wondering if anyone on here would be willing to help me with groceries.

I on it had enough money to pay for the rent and the electric so I’m kinda stuck and just need a little help. Thank you for reading.

Someone suggested I make a list in Walmart so I figured out how. I added things that I would need to cook and other things I know my children will eat. I’m not that worried about myself as much. There is a lot of fish items on there because the only meat one of my sons can eat is fish. Thank you

,Have been dissociated /feeling depersonalization all day,"Apologies if this isn't a good fit for this sub; or if some of this doesn't make sense or if it's too lengthy. My brain is semi-frozen atm, am having a hard time thinking

While I was getting ready to start my day this morning, I got a text from a dear friend. I had texted her earlier wishing her a happy new year, that sort of thing.

She told me out of the blue that she's having brain surgery this coming Friday. That they're going to remove part of a large tumour; there are smaller ones they can't cut out.

Brain surgery? WTF?

I had no idea this was going on. She had received treatment for skin cancer earlier this year (second time for her with skin cancer; the first time was almost ten years ago). About a month ago we talked; she had been cleared of cancer. Clean bill of health, etc.

I live with C-PTSD, ADHD, major depressive disorder. Dissociation (aka depersonalization / derealization) is something that happens to me on a frequent basis. I've got a prescription for Ativan that I use if anxiety is too hard to control, or if there's a PTSD flare-up. Or if I get too overwhelmed to function, for whatever reason. I took one last night because of anxiety.

As soon as I got her text about the surgery I could feel myself dissociating. And I haven't been able to snap out of it; didn't want to take an Ativan because it was such a nice day out for a change, plus didn't want to take two back to back.

Am having a hard time functioning atm. I called a distress line earlier, which helped. Took a bath to see if it'd ground me. I've eaten. Got out for a bit. All that helped. But as soon as I got back home, bam.

Dissociation sucks big time. I just wish I could function during however many hours are left tonight. There was so much I wanted to do. I haven't been able to. Spent most of the time looking online for places that will deliver apple strudels to my friend's place (she and her husband love them). Couldn't find anything 'cause most places are closed today.

Just wish my brain would snap out of this; wish I could just have a really good cry and get back to ""normal. Fuck. Instead, I'm here barely able to keep my eyes open."
,Help out a graphic designerlooking to hone their craft & get back to their roots of creating digital art & paintings for pleasure..not just sleek vectors for work. I would be SO appreciative! Even if you were able to donate or sell very old equipment. Anything to get me started again!,"Hi I'm a working graphic design artist that works mostly in Adobe Illustrator when doing any kind of image, icon, logo, font, illustration etc.

I also use Photoshop quite a bit..but these days I use it for work stuff like photo editing for clients, photo compisites etc.

I used to have an art tablet msny yrs ago and loved creating digital raster art in Photoshop.
These days I no longer have a tablet and find it rlly difficult to get any amount of control whrn trying to draw or paint in Photoshop.

I do plenty of artistic things for clients but because I am working w a comp & mouse only kind of setup I find I do not have the control needed to create actual paintings and drawings like I used to. If I want to do an illustration I do it in Adobe Illustrator since it really does not require intricate hand control (only a mouse as you are not actually drawing/painting flowing from your hand movements in the same way.

Long story short I want to get back to creating digital art and paintings for the pure pleasure of it, outside of work..I would love more than anything to get some kind of digital art tablet, or even an art stylus as I do have an old Ipad Gen 5. that I have Adobe Sketch downloaded on. I jusy straight up cannot afford it. I work full time but have a lot of financial issues right now.

If anyone has anything like this that they no longer use/have since upgraded I would be literally overjoyed if you would consider donating it to me! I don't care if it's a really old/out of date model. Anything at all would allow me to get back into digital painting!! I do make vector illustrations for work in Illustrator but it's just not the sane as feeling the ""pen"" and art flow through your hand like w a tablet/stylus.

If you cannot donate pls let me know if you woulf consider selling me an old model for an inexpensive price?

,In college and I need a little help paying off the rest of my rent.," So I'm currently a Junior studying Computer Science. I have taken out loans that with some scholarships have helped me pay off my tuition. Paying for Housing has had to come out of pocket. My parents were able to help me in my first two years, however due to unforeseen circumstances, they weren't able to help as much as I possibly needed. I had a summer job and also got a job during the semester and it helped pay off most of it, but coming up to the end of the year I'm $250 short. I stay on campus so since I'm late they've put my account on hold and I can't even finish registering for classes. I've contacted all campus resources only to come to no avail since it's holiday season. I maxed out my only credit card partly due to housing and I can't get a loan or another credit card since my credit score isn't the best right now. I really don't have any other family in a position that could help me right now so this is my last resort. If I don't pay soon they'll change my lock until I'm able to pay for it. It'll be a while until I get paid because my on-campus job is closed for the holiday break.

UPDATE**

Hi everyone! Thank you so much for all your kindness. I received many invitations and wasn’t able to attend to all. So I’m sorry. Yesterday afternoon, someone invited me out for a walk, lunch and visit Christmas market with him and his friends. I was supposed to go to street party with them but I was feeling a little bit down so I didn’t end up going. They were really nice to me. After that, I got an invitation to go to a club with a group of people. But sadly I didn’t manage to get a ticket so I couldn’t join. I still did meet up with someone for a drink and chat.

I really appreciate all of your responses and kindness. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart, redditors. 

Someone thought the story was fake. But sadly it wasn’t. I’m still in shock about what happened. It does look like something that happens in a movie so I understand."

That's a relief, but we still have an uphill battle ahead of us, and gas is what we are struggling to stay on top of the most. $10 would undoubtedly get us through the rest of the week, although even $5 would make tomorrow a whole lot less stressful as I could get my partner to work. 

Thanks so much for reading, and Happy New Year!"
,I escaped an abusive situation and now I need an emergency place to stay,"So I'm a woman and in my mid-20s. I recently did the unthinkable and escaped an abusive situation. When I escaped, I lost all of my friends so now I have nowhere to go. I don't have a lot of money, and I really need a safe place to stay while I find a new job and save a little money to get my own place or find roommates.

I'm scared and not really sure what else to do because I desperately don't want to end up in a shelter or dead on the street."
,Help me get to therapy in exchange for custom art!,"Hello everyone and all the best to you for the new year!

I'm an artist and I'm dealing with a serious mental health problem. I would like to ask for help with funding psychotherapy. I work full-time as a designer and do art commissions on the side, but unfortunately I still can't afford therapy. The good news is that I have a diagnosis and I've found a specialist for it in my area. Unfortunately, sessions cost the equivalent of US $64 each (which is a lot of money in my country) and I don't have the funds for it.

If you'd like to know more details about the mental health side, I'll be happy to answer in a private message, I just wanted to stay away from writing anything that could be triggering for anyone. And if you'd like to see some of my art, you can check it out here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/fzl2n1f](https://imgur.com/gallery/fzl2n1f) (please note that there are a few nude studies among them.)

Anything you can contribute is extremely helpful and will go towards funding my therapy. I will even make a quick drawing for $1. Thank you so much for reading!"

,I'm in the last month of my lease and I can't make rent,"Hi Reddit,

I'm reaching out because I'm pretty frightened and Reddit is a pretty special place. I'm in the last month of a lease near Cleveland, OH and I'm already late on rent. My fiance hasn't worked consistently since July and the only way we make enough to afford our home is by the both of us splitting the rent and utilities evenly. This just hasn't been the case for a long time culminating in me having to pay the entirety of our $1475 a month rent. I'm faced with an eviction if I pay later than the 5th and I just don't know what to do. I've reached out to local charities with the consistent response being that they have already extended as much as they can to members of the community.

I guess the kicker in all this is, is that she has 4 children that spend varying amounts of time here (7 to 17 years old) due to the staying arrangements with their father. The little ones haven't seen their mom be so stable, local and actually have a warm house and ample room for all of them when they are here. It's been good for them, good for their mom and as a guy in his late 30s without kids, it's probably the closest semblance to a family that I'll ever really have. I'm not a father to any of them nor do I try to portray it (it was never expected out of me), but we have all taken a liking to each other and it feels pretty cool to have a bunch of littles wanting to hang with ya while watching a movie or playing games. I feel I'm going to let everyone down when I know I'm going above and beyond what my level of responsibility and contribution should be. Yet, I'll be on the losing end if I get evicted on month 18 of a 18 month lease. I'm really at a loss and if this reads desperate it's because it is. My work deposit should come through tonight or tomorrow (holiday delay it seems) and I'll be at exactly $1000 to my landlord. I'm tempted to just turn over that amount and hope for the best. He's very by the book and time and time again has said eviction notices go up on the 6th. 

I appreciate everyone's time and energy, thank you."

I didn't expect it to take so long to get a job."
,In over my head,"Last night my 13 year old daughter attempted suicide. Our living situation is tough since eviction and living in a extended stay hotel had left us nearly nearly broke all thetime. Obviously since we are dealing with this we have been preoccupied. My husband forgot to mice his paycheck to the account we use to pay the room and between it being short and two autopayments coming out we don't have enough to pay our weekly room rate. What we have left would only cover 3 days at the daily rate before putting us to living in the car. There are no shelter openings. We just need 100 to make the weekly rate and keep above water. I don't want my kids further traumatised on top of this. Or my daughter thinking this is her fault later. I don't know what to do. I have jobhunted. The spouse and I both plasma donate and there's nothing left we can pawn. I just am so overwhelmed. And at the end of my resources.

,Was just scammed a week before my birthday trying to buy a car.,"Hello and Happy New Year to everyone! I will be 27 next week and I work really hard at a dead end job, and to make life a bit simpler I’m trying to buy my very first car. I was emailed by a gentleman who claimed to work for an auto auction and he gave me some info and told me to put a $200 down payment in order for him to bid for me. I was supposed to get a 2004 Dodge Charger. Yes a little beat up but still it would’ve helped in the long run. I gave him the money and he gave me a receipt and I haven’t heard anything from him since. Anyways now I’m out some money and now it’s gonna take even longer for me to save up for one. Without a car there’s so many jobs I cannot get or even get to an interview. I’ve lost out on so many potential opportunities because I don’t have a car. I don’t ever celebrate, do or get anything for my birthday but it would be nice for me to at least have enough to put another down payment on an even better car elsewhere from someone legitimate.

I have cut corners every where possible: cancelled Netflix, my cellphone and went to the food bank to feed me and my son. What I really need is help buying Shady her food: Hills Science Diet prescription i/d with turkey. It can only be purchased through her Vet clinic as they have kept the prescription in-house. It is $39 per 12 pack.

,My (21f) boyfriend (23m) had a seizure while driving yesterday,"My (21f) boyfriend (23m) had a seizure yesterday while driving and thankfully only has slight damage to his car (namely scratches and only the emergency parking brake works). The main concern is that he ended up in an ambulance and then the hospital where a nurse informed him (once he was coherent) that his insurance was no longer valid. He was under the impression that his insurance was valid and thought he had taken care of everything, but obviously not. So now he’s stuck with a pretty hefty bill for the hospital ER and the ambulance ride. He also still has to see a neurologist (his CT came back clear and nothing was abnormal at the hospital except that his white blood cell count was low which is typical of seizures) and without insurance, that appointment doesn’t come cheap. I desperately want to help him with the bills but don’t know how. I’m in college working two part time jobs and he works full time already. Is there any advice anyone can give me or perhaps any legal loopholes that might help us decrease the bills? Thanks in advance!"
,Psychiatric Service dog to get my life back," I am 19 years old. I have been admitted into mental health institutions due to my mental health problems. I have gotten a multitude of diagnoses, I have had partial therapy, but I am still on the waiting list for the next big inpatient therapy program I will be going to. I live at home with my parents in the Netherlands (Utrecht province)), but due to my anxiety disorders I am unable to even go outside alone. Because of that going to college or working has also gotten impossible for me to do.

The one thing that I want most, is to get my life back, in an independent and healthy way. My psychiatrist, other professionals involved and I have come to the conclusion that a psychiatric service dog would be an ideal solution. This psychiatric service dog would be a huge step towards getting my life back.

Psychiatric service dogs aren’t covered by the Dutch health care system. That’s the reason why I wouldn’t be able to take this step alone and need help with getting there. That’s why I have had to make this post, to ask if there would be a possibility you could give a contribution so that I can become part of our society again. If you have any other ideas or other ways to contribute in a different way, I’m open for that as well.

,Update on my hunger situation,"Edit: Fulfilled by u/perpetualCrown!

OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/ehv3ec/in_an_airbnb_temporarily_with_little_food_in_the/

I didn’t eat anything yesterday. I missed out on a pizza sweepstakes run by u/Geminerva because I wasn’t registered. Now that I am, I’d like to give it another shot:

I just found a food pantry in my area, but it’s not open on Wednesday. I’ve been contacting my AirBNB host since Monday night and he finally responded this morning and said he may be able to stop by late tonight and pick up a meal or something from Wendy’s. I need something right now, though, I’m literally shaking from hunger.

I’m going to be dealing with this for the next month until I plan to move out of state with my online friend, and my financial situation will likely be good enough for me to sustain by then. I’m going to try to ask for some cheap food items like rice, pasta and bagels on r/food_pantry so I can be held over for the time being so I don’t have to post here again, but those items would probably be delivered next week. So these next couple of days should  be rough. When my host gets here tonight I’m going to talk to him about my situation (no money and work) and see if he can find a way help me out for the week.

I need something for today, though. Can someone help me out with a gift card from Domino’s (that’s the only food chain that offers gifts within walking distance)? I hate having to ask, I feel like such a beggar, but my life is a fuckin’ mess right now financially for many reasons that I won’t get into. It’s hard to focus on things when I’m food insecure to this degree. I noticed my previous post got downvoted, so I hope I’m not breaking some kind of rule."

,Help a disabled trans woman fix her PC,"This may not seem to be very important, but it really is.

**Why this needs to be done**

I have *a lot* of disabilities: cPTSD, Autism, ADHD Combined Type, Dyslexia, Depression, Anxiety, OSDD, Long-term Memory Loss, stress triggered Panic Attacks, Selecitve Muteness, and vaious joint and body problems including Arthritis and breathing issues that occationally require the use of a cane or staff. On most days, I am stuck at home, unable to leave or do anything around the apartment. As such, I am unable to keep a job. My computer is my main source of disability assistance as well as something to keep me from dwelling on depressive thoughts. On that computer, I have various tools that help me keep track of my symptoms, do research on my disabilities, interact with and learn from others that have similar problems, as well as tools to teach me ASL and allow me to communicate with others when I cannot speak. It is also my quickest link to getting in person help when I need it. This computer has saved my life on multiple occations and its currently very fragile, frequently requiring me to fiddle with the guts of it to get it working again. In it's current state, it is almost useless and cannot help me in most cases. It needs to be fixed, if not completely replaced, save the HDD. I can plug my HDD into my roommate's computer for a temporary fix, but that is not ideal in the slightest and won't work long term.

&#x200B;

**Why I can't do this on my own**

We barely have enough to pay bills due to low income and high bills. I have very little spending money and every penny I've gotten in the past couple months has gone into fixing this thing with little luck. With that money, i have managed to get the thing running for 20 hours before breaking down again. The household income is too low to put money into this. As such, most of my subscription based services have run out. I have replaced a lot of stuff: I replaced the motherboard and CPU multiple times with no success, the graphics card and RAM are working perfectly, my HDD is functioning and contains all my tools and other data, the case is shattered and unusable (damn demon cat), peripherals and external devices are functioning, but the moniter can use replacement.

&#x200B;

The longer my PC is broken, the more progress I lose with tracking and managing my disabilities and the higher the risk of massive issues that could be otherwise prevented. I simply dont have the money do fix this, so I need y'all's help to fix my main source of disability assistance. Please help me.

This year his family's money has wrung us dry. I have an attorney very familiar with my case to hire and here's the problem. His retainer is $5500. We've borrowed money from family and already have a lien against our car from the last trial in June.

I have borrowed $2000 from my gracious Aunt and need another $1000 by Thursday (tomorrow). After that we have a payment plan for the $2500 remaining. 

I go to court on Tuesday, 1/7/20.

Money will be even tighter than it is, I understand. I'm being hired by an organization as a Peer Supporter for those with addiction and mental health issues and I can't wait to begin! My husband u/sarcasiman has been laid off, unexpectedly, for the holidays. They gave him 1 days notice and he returns to work tomorrow. That will help with payments going forward.

My husband and I have been to every place in town to secure a loan to no avail. The institutions online are offering me $400 at 609% and we just can't pay that amount.

I'm lost. I'm broke. There was no Christmas this year. The absolute first thing on our minds is saving our daughter from mental and emotional abuse by him. He didn't call for Christmas or New Year's, proving again he does not care about her, only hurting me and controling her.

Good people of reddit, will you please help me with any amout of money you can? I'd happily direct you straight to my attorney's office to make a donation.

Thank you for your generosity to all people who need help. I volunteer a lot with people in need and I know how much it means to them. It would mean just as much to us and our daughter.

Hello everyone! I hope your new year is off to a better start than mine is. A few months back I was laid off of my job and waiting unemployment. My unemployment was eventually denied because I’m a full time student (not sure why or how, but that’s PA for you). I FINALLY gained employment and had orientation yesterday, however I had to use the last of my money for gas and interview materials. To make matters worse, my mom needed a last minute ride to work this morning, promised me more than enough gas money, and ended up screwing me by giving me $5 for a 50 mile round trip, using the last of my gas I had.

I start Monday, the 6th, but I won’t get a paycheck until at least 2 weeks from then. I’ve exhausted all other options, and truly don’t know what to do. I have no groceries, my cats are down to their last little bit of food/litter, I have barely any gas. I can provide proof, if necessary, of everything I’ve said.

,Please help us help our favorite kitty!,"My husband and I adopted a very special kitty after he was found by the side of a road injured and partially paralyzed. We have invested the time since his adoption giving Nico the loving home he deserves and doing whatever is in our power to see him to whatever recovery is possible. He will never be able to walk like a normal kitty, but he makes up for it with all the affection his little body can muster. He is not in any pain that any of his specialists or his regular vet can tell, and lives a very full life otherwise. 

Unfortunately, Friday after Christmas he developed a complete urinary blockage that multiple hospitalizations have not been able to resolve, and will need surgery to get him back to 100%. Full disclosure, we have already spent well over $3k on emergency care and hospitalization, and thanks to CareCredit we have done it with no other assistance, but we are reaching the end of our means. If we can't get surgery, Nico cannot survive. I'm sure there are a lot of people who will say that a cat isn't worth all this trouble, but Nico fought hard to get where he is now. He's family, and you don't just un-adopt your family just because they're a little broken. We appreciate every share and every cent towards his recovery.

,"Lost, “Snippy”","
In a hurricane several years back, my family’s home flooded. Everyone is safe, so we count ourselves very fortunate. My daughter has never found her favorite stuffed animal since then as a huge creek washed through our house. We looked everywhere and I’ve searched online as well, but it seems there’s no hope. I’d all but given up when I realized that if **anyone** could help me, it’s Reddit sleuths! 

I can’t remember where we purchased it. I think it was a Walgreens or CVS drugstore on a Easter some time since 2007/2008. I don’t know how to explain what the coat of this bunny felt/looked like. 

I’ve searched online and haven’t seen anything even remotely similar. She called it her “snippy bunny” because the texture of the bunny was such that she would rub it between her fingers, pull upwards, and “snip it” as she drifted off to sleep every night. 

This is so important to me because:

Not only was her home flooded that year, but her aunt (my sister who lived with us) passed away unexpectedly. We moved 4 times that year. The next year we moved across the country, her older sister was hospitalized for over a month, my life imploded with a shocking affair that ended my marriage and we moved across the country again. I tried to be in the moment as much as possible, but there were days I spent vomiting, too weak to get up off the bathroom floor, experiencing major depression & a newly diagnosed thyroiditis. When it rains... 

We’ve never really gotten back on our feet since then. I just want to be able to give her some sort of that childhood comfort back. 

**Can anyone help me find another bunny like the one in the photo??**

Or give me any information that may help me get closer? Anybody know the terms to explain/describe what it’s made out of?

,Need a way to make money from home.,"I'm disabled thanks to mental health and I have 6-8 months before I start getting payments from SSI. But I also have 1000 left on my hospital bill. I have to pay 200 every month and I have -400 in my bank account. I live with my parents and mom pays me about 400 a month if I cook 4 days a week and do about two dozen chores a week, nothing too bad. But my medicine in over 100 a month, plus therapy, plus doctor visits and I'm never in the green. I can't drive so no job unless it's from home. Also I fill out a bunch of surveys and stuff. It was hard I put every dollar I got from Christmas and from my mom into my credit card and I still had -100 and I'm back to -400 with bills. 

My credit limit is 600 so I need to get significant amount of money relatively quickly and have no way to do it. 

Any ideas?"
,Help With My Last Bit of Rent,"I'm a bit short on my rent, about 270 dollars. I was able to sell some things and get the first bit but my car has not sold and I don't think it will by the end of tomorrow.

,Help 5 kids burned out of home & homeless!,"Not sure if I’m doing this right, but I run a nonprofit for unsheltered homeless people and I’ve been coordinating care for this family. 2 parents and 5 kids, lost their apartment & belongings in a fire. Due to the size of their family and HUD requirements that mandate a 4-BR for that many people, they are having a hard time finding shelter without splitting up the family. When they came to my attention the kids were split up among friends & neighbors and the parents were sleeping in their van to save the Red Cross money for an eventual rent deposit. Here is news coverage:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fox5atlanta.com/news/apartment-fire-leaves-family-of-7-scrambling-to-find-shelter-ahead-of-christmas.amp

I’ve scrambled over $3k through churches & nonprofits to get them all together in a hotel through Christmas & first week of January. But after that I don’t know where they will go. They are trying to recreate burned paperwork etc & are making headway, but with agencies being closed, cold weather creating high demand for shelter, and their big family it is going to be a long road. The dad works 2 jobs and the mom takes care of one of the kids who has a serious chronic illness that requires frequent hospitalization. 

Anyway - I’d love to see their gofundme get more traction! They are trying SO hard to stay together, it would be an absolute crime if they had to split addresses and force themselves to live apart!

,My father died and can't pay college,"Hello fellow Redditors!

I hope you are having an awesome day and I apologize for reposting this is just the I didn't get help before and, obeying the rules, I waited enough to post again.

I'm Diego, a fourth-year Electronics engineering student. I study in Colombia, although I'm from Peru, at Pereira's Technological University.

The tuition fee in my college is paid every semester but there is a scholarship that is granted to the best student of the program, that is, the student with the highest grades in the semester. I've won this scholarship since the first semester because of my grades but this semester was particularly difficult because my father passed away and I had to travel back home, Peru, stood there for 5 days - he passed away in the third day I was there - and went back to Colombia: all of this during my mid-term exams. Although my grades aren't that bad this semester, they are not enough for me to get the scholarship mentioned above so I resort to this fundraising in order to be able to pay for next semester's tuition fee.

If you want to know me a bit better, please search for ""Diego Guisasola"" at my university's site and you'll find all my accomplishments: [https://www.utp.edu.co/](https://www.utp.edu.co/) the search box is located at the middle-right of the screen.

If you still have doubts, please contact me and I'll send you a video from my campus.

Every single contribution counts and I'll be forever thankful.

Note 1: In Colombia, the grading system is from 0-5: [Grades](https://lensdump.com/i/iPlMmi)

Note 2: As I'm not a US citizen, I can't create fundraising in sites like [GoFundMe.com](https://gofundme.com/). Here in Colombia, there is a similar site called [Vaki.co](https://vaki.co/), which is just as safe as the former.

I've done weight loss journeys before. The lowest I've reached in recent years is in the 260s. My goal weight is 150-200. Somewhere in there is my range of preference. I have diagnosed PCOS, GAD, and clinical depression. They last two make it difficult to motivate me and the first one makes it difficult to lose weight.


I currently am a dog walker and regularly walk 6,000 feet a day, 5 days a week. Because of my job, I will typically spend 12ish hrs in my car some days. Some days its only 8hrs. It varies greatly. Now, my problem is (despite the fact that I've become somewhat acitve compared to my previous jobs), I'm not really able to eat healthy. Anything I carry for my lunches would have to be non perishable and I've typically discovered that it's junk food or snacks. If I have breaks I can go home, but if I don't have a long enough break, my options are really just fast food or don't eat.

,"Hi reddit, my family and I desperately need your help","My mother was a victim of dental malpractice when a dentist unnecessarily suggested to remove all her teeth to treat several infections.

My mother is a Syrian immigrant and doesn't speak much English so she went along with it.

Now, she's gone almost 4 years without teeth. We have tried going to several dentists to get dentures or implants, but unfortunately we were taken advantage of and given false promises by several different dentists.

Now, my mother has suffered severe bone loss due to the lack of teeth in her mouth (in her upper and lower arches) to the point where she is in constant pain and severely handicapped.

She is unable to eat and take in nutrients properly, and her face is beginning to cave in (for lack of a better term) due to the lack of bone.

We tried seeking treatment at the NYU dental clinic, and after being wait listed for over a year, we were turned away because they said my mothers case is too complicated.

We were finally directed to a clinic named Clearchoice clinic, where they specialize in prosthodontics and more complex cases like my mothers.

They immediately understood my mother's situation and laid out a plan to fix it. They are treating her like a human being with a medical condition, instead of seeing her need for teeth as ""cosmetic""

The treatment plan was fully laid out and explained to us in detail, and it's my mother's only hope to have teeth before she loses even more bone and has no option for implants any more.

The only problem is that the treatment costs $59,000 ( a hybrid double arch replacement) and we are a poor immigrant family just struggling to get by. We have the option to finance through loan companies, but even the smallest monthly payments are too much for us to afford on top of all the other bills we already struggle with.

I can't sugar coat it even if I tried, my mother is in a terrible situation and we need serious financial help in order to do this procedure.

We created a gofundme a little while ago and the link is at the bottom of this post. I really appreciate you guys reading and any help sharing this post or with donations would be extremely appreciated, Thank You!

,Veteran Fundraiser for Central New York," Responsive to our Community (ROC), is a Central New York (CNY) charity that offers paid, on-the-job construction training for at-risk veterans, giving them the skills and experience needed to compete for union jobs.  Specifically, ROC works with local municipalities to acquire dilapidated buildings, and then through ROCs’s Center for Employment Training (ROC CET), the veterans refurbish and renovate the buildings into affordable apartments for homeless domestic violence survivors and their children.   

 ROC completed its pilot Proof of Concept project in 2017.  ROC is currently rehabilitating  a historic, 12,000 square foot building in downtown Oneida, NY.  The expansion  project transforms a vacant hotel into a safe, energy efficient, and sustainable affordable housing unit.  

In order for their expansion to be completed they need help! ROC is taking part in the 22nd Annual Charity and Preview Event hosted by the Syracuse Auto Dealers Association. Tickets can be bought for the event for $125, if you live in the area. However, you can also donate money on their website at [www.responsivecommunity.com](https://www.responsivecommunity.com). This organization could be a huge break for the veterans, and victims of domestic violence in CNY.

Poncho's passion and love for life was contagious. If you were sad, he made you feel better. If you needed help, he was the first one to assist. If you were scared, he built up your confidence. If you were happy, he brightened your day so much more. 

Being of service to others was in his blood. He joined the Mexican Red Cross at an early age and followed it with service in the Army, as a Ranger and in the 82nd Airborne. He then became an LAUSD teacher (where he was awarded 2008 Teacher of the Year)  and later Principal, only to be fueled by the existing educational inequalities to become a force of change. He excelled as an educational and social justice advocate, consistently fighting for more equitable opportunities in schools for families in many cities. His heart was in every job he chose, person he helped, and community he worked for. The following articles written about him give an example of what an inspirational and compassionate man of God he was not only in his personal life but in every single aspect of his career:

As a family we are all helping but there is only so much we can do. Poncho was the sole provider for his wife Lourdes and four beautiful children- Sofia, Pablo, Ricardo, and Miguel. This has become an overwhelming situation with lots of need for help. She and the kids need help until she is able to find a job.  They are at risk of losing their home and struggling to cover everyday necessities. We ask that you please help us in passing along the compassion and generosity Poncho always showed everyone he crossed paths with. We are sincere in saying that any amount goes an extremely long way. We will ensure every donation collected is given to Lourdes to help pay for expenses.

We thank you in advance from the bottom of our hearts for your help.

Words and a story told to us by Lourdes that shine light as to who our dear Poncho was and will continue to be:

“Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness.”

\-R.J Palacio-

""A friend of Poncho's was struggling and needed money. She asked Poncho if he could help her out by lending her money. My brother as he is opened his wallet and saw he only had a bill of $50 and it was the only money he had for the weekend for food for his family.  He told me to wait right there as he ran to change  the bill. He gave me $25 and said, 'Take this, we will manage.'  He knew he  needed it but still gave it to me. I  will always be grateful to him."""
,I would like for some people to donate some money towards my charity run to raise money for Ronald McDonald house nz,"Please remove if not allowed My son was born a very sick boy. He has a condition called lesch nyhan which causes issues with the amount of uric acid produced in his body and a bunch of other issues. By the time they figured out the fact that he had tongue tie at 3 days old, he was in full renal failure. At 4 days old we got told to say goodbye as he was likely not going to make it through the night but that they were going to experiment a drug. That drug ended up working and we got sent an hour and a half away to Starship.

During our month at Starship, my husband and I  stayed 200m away from the hospital at the Ronald McDonald house. They were extremely welcoming and took effort to know you. They also have family meal nights and frozen dinners and other foods for the families who can't afford it. It was a huge weight off our shoulders. 

In March they are doing a charity thing where you exercise to raise money. I dont have many friends or family but I would love to help the Ronald McDonald house association help other families in need. Any small amount helps. Thank you

,My Best Friends Mom Died and They Need Help Raising Money for a Memorial Service," My best friend's mother passed away yesterday. He has been financially supporting her for years as she had some mental disabilities. He lives in a small town in Arkansas and works long hours at a lumber mill. He also helps support his grandson. As a result of all the financial assistance he gives, he has no savings. His mother's death yesterday wasn't expected so he isn't sure how he's going to pay for the cremation or memorial service.

""I type this not really knowing what to say so I'll just be honest. I am not a man of means. The most basic service is more money than I have or am able to come up with quickly. I was denied a loan,  and I have nothing of value to sell.  Most of my family are on low fixed monthly incomes with no disposable wealth.  

My mom raised two sons on her own. She took in people who needed help. Gave teen runaways a place to stay till their parents got them. She didnt have much but was willing to share till the point of having nothing for herself if it meant helping a child. 

I have nowhere to turn in order to give my mother the final respect she deserves. My dear friend Shawna Woodson  created this fund raiser in order to try to help.

I know my mother would not want anyone to give out of a sense of burden on her behalf. So please,  dont put yourself out or into a bind. If you can donate then its appreciated more than I have the words to say.

Thank you, and feel free to share.""

,Friend of mine had to unexpectedly move out. Lost her 2 jobs due to injuries caused in a prior one and needs assistance.,"[Link to the gofundme.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/single-mom-whose-life-took-unexpected-turn?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-3)

The gofundme link lists everything that had happened to her for the past few months, but to paraphrase what happened, my friend needs financial assistance for this month so she can find a full time job. She used to work as an assistant for a class that had special needs kids, and one of those kids attacked her one day, fracturing her legs.

Since then, she has had other jobs, but due to her legs swelling up, she was let go from her other jobs. Her son has special needs and can not attend classes for more than 3 hours, until his IEP is setup in 4 weeks, meaning that until then she can not work full time as she will be attending to her son after those 3 hours.

She is getting documents setup to work for Lyft and uber, as all the other jobs she applied for have not gotten back to her, nor has her applications for government assistance. So even small donations for gas money will go a long way.

Again, her gofundme is more detailed on what she went through and why she needs the assistance, so if you do have the time please read it! Thank you for taking the time to read my post, and I hope you all have a great day/night!"

,My husky had to have emergency surgery to save his life,"On December 28th, my sweet dog had to have emergency surgery to remove a blockage in his stomach and intestines. He had eaten part of a toy we gave him on Christmas (even though I was watching closely to make sure that didn’t happen). The emergency vet kept him in the hospital for ~42 hours, where they gave him the best care we could have asked for. We’re going on two weeks since his surgery, and he’s doing so well. He’s a tough little boy, though he’s still scared to be left alone after all this. 

His final bill came to $5178.00, all of which I put on a credit card. Normally, we would have funds set aside for emergencies. Unfortunately, 2019 was the year of severe medical issues for my family. I was diagnosed with a chronic pain issue, my boy husky was diagnosed with epilepsy and this obstruction, and my girl husky tore her ACL and needed surgery to walk. On my dogs medical expenses alone, I spent roughly $12,000.00 in 2019. I’m currently looking for a second job to get us through, but we could use all the help we can get. Even sharing our gofundme would be a huge help, or just sending well wishes to my puppers. They’re the reason I get up in the morning.

1face is a charity site that sells watches and a portion of each sale goes to helping a good cause, be it hunger, cancer, or aids. It's a really cool idea, but whenever I look them up on Google I can't find anything on them other than their own site.

,Need help with medical expenses,"https://gogetfunding.com/help-nini-with-her-medical/

Hi, my name is Nicole and I'm 18 years old. 4 months ago i found a painless lump on my right armpit and I also check my boobs to see if i have any lump or any sign of breast cancer because my mom had a breast cancer so i really need to check mine. I don't feel any lump on my boobs so i ignored the lump on my armpit. I go to a surgeon because of my armpit lump. The doctor said i need to get a breast ultrasound to know what kind of lump is on my armpit. I got the result and he said i have a cyst on my right breast but it was too small and my armpit lump was big and he gave me antibotic for the lump. The doctor said i should have a breast ultrasound after 2 months to see if something change but i didn't have a chance to go to the doctor again due to financial problem.

On september, i started to have a breast pain and my left armpit started to have pain too but there is no lump. I also experience nausea, hot feeling on my neck and shoulder area and back and shoulder pain.

On the first week of october, i feel a lump on my neck and it was a pea size and the lump on my armpit got bigger also. I'm so worried of condition because it really got worsed. I called my doctor and he said i really need to take lab/medical tests and we need to prepare ₱140k (philippine money) = $2800 for the tests (ultrasound, pet/ct scan and mammogram) to determine my condition. The doctor said my case was rare and its a immediate medical care. I don't have health insurance and here in the philippines we don't have foundation that will help you with your medical test bill. We also talked to our government to ask for help but they said they can't help me due to the limited funds. I really have no choice but to create this fundraising to have a money for my medical tests.

Its been 4 months but my parents can't send me to the hospital due to the financial problem. Please help me and my family. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for reading this. 💜"
,Bronze (doberman) needs help.,"I rescued this dog from a horrible situation during our recent move. I called animal control numerous times to report this doberman we now call bronze being beaten and left in a crate outside all year round. He constantly escaped and would come over into our yard and would would feed him and do what we could for him. 2 weeks before our move our drunken neighbor was outside kicking the crate and screaming at this dog for no reason before pulling him out and throwing him over the fence into the ditch outside while telling him to ""get"" ""go"". I was outside at the time went into the woods and got him. 2 weeks later we moved and he's now in a better house hold. He weighed 33 pounds when we got him. And he's now at 37. He's been to the vet and has multiple infections and problems that I can't afford to treat all at once such as a tick and fleas-(treated) kidney infection, UTI, Demodicosis-(treated), worms (being treated) hip dysplasia. Our veterinarian is trying to work with me in getting him treated but I can't do it by myself. I get paid every 2 weeks and I am doing what I can to help get this dog get back on track. The vet said he is about 5-6 years of age. He's a fighter but I need help to get him back to weight and treated. If you can help us with anything it would be greatly appreciated.

,Hamster with growth found in the snow and needs to see a vet!,"Hi everyone,

UPDATE: The hamster has seen the vet, had what turned out to be a large abscess drained, and has been prescribed antibiotics and pain meds. They said he should be back to acting like a healthy hamster in 7-10 days!

&#x200B;

Someone in my local area found a pet hamster left outside in the snow- presumably because of the large tumor/growth on its face (pics attached- its on their left side). The person that found the hamster couldn't care for it, so we took it on as my boyfriend and I have experience owning small pets and quickly made a bin cage for the little guy, until we get to the pet store today and get proper bedding, a wheel, etc. However, we need to get him/her looked at as soon as possible so we can treat the tumor on their face, and it'll be a financial hardship on us as we're both working college students and weren't expecting to pay for vet treatment of an additional animal. The campaign is currently just to cover the initial appointment but we will likely raise the amount/ start a new campaign once we know how much it will be to fix whatever is wrong. To clarify, no matter what this hamster is going to receive care on Jan 9th, and we will be paying the veterinarian with CareCredit. However donations will help us out greatly with paying off the CareCredit. Anyone who donates can request more pics of the hammy and even help us name him/her too. Thank you so much!

,London Marathon," 

Hi Reddit my name is Derek, from Scotland,

I am ENABLE Scotland’s community facilitator for Ayrshire.

We support people all over Scotland with learning disabilities.

I am currently setting up active groups in Kilmarnock, Ayr and Saltcoats to support children from 10-15 years old and young adults from 16-18 years old, While also running ACE groups for adults 19+.

These groups will focus on being “active” health & wellbeing and getting regular people from the local communities involved.

To raise awareness for this I have volunteered to run the London Marathon this year as mencap (our sister charity in England was named virgin charity of the year) were given spaces to have participants run in the marathon. The cost to enter is £2000, so I have just recently set up my fundraising page [https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/DerekDorrans](https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/DerekDorrans)

If anyone can share the link so it can reach as many people as possible that would be awesome or even sponsor a little themselves.

,My 15 year old stepson was in a car wreck which left him with a traumatic brain injury. Please read his story.,"On December 4th, 2019, my 15 year old stepson was involved in a car accident.  On his way to school, he rode with three friends that morning.  The driver of the car suffered a seizure behind the wheel.  Their car crossed the center lane, into a ditch, and ran for over 1000 ft before slamming into a concrete structure.  

He suffered a multitude of injuries.  Traumatic brain injury in two different parts of the brain, whiplash, a torn heart valve, a collapsed lung, a nearly severed tongue and a fractured leg were just the beginning of what the days to come would bring.  Ultimately, he was placed in a medically induced coma with a shunt in both his brain to drain off hemorrhaging as well as a shunt in his lung.  In total, he spent 18 days in a coma, drained 9 liters of blood/cerebral spinal fluid off of his brain, and he coded twice in that time.  His mother was present both times, and these days were the hardest.  

Eventually the decision was made to wake him because he was not improving on the ventilator.  Waking him was difficult and tough.  His tongue had now swollen to fill the whole of his mouth and it was understood that if we took the ventilator out we would not be able to get it back in because of this, and that a tracheotomy would be our sole option.  

After five incredibly scary days off of the ventilator, he gradually began to improve.  His weight loss was significant—-40 pounds total.  He was on a tube feed during his coma but wasn’t fed correctly by staff.   His mom has since had him transferred to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta where he’s spent the past 3 days.  During this time he’s made improvements and started to gain weight back.  It’s still a long road ahead for our family.  He will be at this facility for a minimum of 3 weeks, and then to an outpatient rehab thereafter. 

His mom has been by his side since the accident occurred.  This means a significant loss of income, as well as many new expenses related to hospital care.  We are not a wealthy family by any means.  

His aunt started a GoFundMe approximately one week after his accident.  We’ve been fortunate enough to have many friends and family donate to this cause, but we still have a long way to go.  Some things the fundraiser has paid for so far:  hotels, parking deck fees, gasoline, food, new clothing for him due to weight loss, physical therapy tools, Christmas presents, and bills that were unable to be covered due to mom not being able to work.  The loss is significant.  

Currently, she is down to just $100. :( 

I am providing a link to the GoFundMe which has in it proof of claims, daily updates on my stepson, progresses, and we’d be happy to provide any other information for validation.  Please consider reading, sharing, or donating.  I will be cross-posting this.

,Help Needed to Fund a Manual Custom Wheelchair," 

I'm having trouble leaving my home due to severe joint pain in my legs. I've tried to get help from doctors for years, but I can no longer wait for them to help. I've tried using a cane to help me walk but as I tend to trip over my own feet constantly adding a third tinier foot just made things worse.

I have neurological and physical disabilities that stop me from being able to use other modes of transportation. I can't use the bus as it triggers seizures, I can't walk or ride a bike because of balance and joint pain issues, and cab fares are expensive. I believe a manual wheelchair would best suit my needs.

I'm almost completely home-bound now unless I have cab fare. With a wheelchair I will be able to go see a doctor when/if needed throughout the month, drop off and pick up prescriptions as needed, buy groceries, and I could even take my dog to the dog park several blocks away.

The issue is that without a proper doctor it would be close to impossible to get a custom wheelchair covered so I need to raise the money myself. The reason for a custom chair is that I am shorter than average and places where used chairs can be found tend to not suit my needs or fit my short legs.

I've checked local organizations out with no luck, and have asked close friends and relatives for help, I have what money I could raise this way saved in a savings account. I don't need the chair inside my apartment so the assistive devices program is also a no go as you must need it indoors and outdoors. In a bit of desperation I even called my mother who I haven't spoken to in years (bad idea, which I am still dealing with emotionally).

I already know the wheelchair I would like to purchase, the Quickie GPV Sports Everyday use Wheelchair, and have gone over the sizing and options for it. I've even decided on a colour, black cherry! Everything is ready I just need enough money to cover all the expenses.

I do not need an electric/motorized scooter or chair as I can still use my upper body to push myself.

I've been debating as to whether or not to get some frog leg casters for it as they would help with my joint problems, but that would add to the expense and I don't want to ask for too much.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Hello there:  

My name is Sydney.  I'm a wife, and a mother, heading up a small family of four that cannot seem to escape the crisis in which we find ourselves.  

I have a treatable, but not curable genetic, auto-inflammatory condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa (Stage 3).  You can research it, but in simple terms, it's a condition that causes large, painful, non-healing abscesses and lesions across all parts of the body that houses apocrine sweat glands (under arms, over thighs, genitals, buttocks, down legs, etc).  At Stage 3, tracts form under the skin, in thick, rope-like formations that travel between the abscesses.  

To say that this condition isn't a pleasure to live with would be the understatement of the century.  Every day is spent in a constant agony that I cannot begin to describe, and because of the extremely painful nature of H.S., I cannot work, or properly care for my young children, (ages 1 and 2).  

I am currently undergoing treatment that should, in time, render me more able to at least make myself useful around the house, and a better part of our children's care, and would also enable us to find adequate work.  That said, recovery and management is an incredibly long road ahead of us (estimated to be about 6-7 months in total for this treatment to be completed), and therefore, we need help to make ends meet with our healthcare and living expenses, which run around $1.500 per month.  

Up until now, we've been relying on my meager earnings as a 3D Animator (the only real work that I'm capable of doing, as it only requires me to use a computer from home), and assistance from family.  This situation is putting an incredible strain on those relationships, and we fear that by the time our situation finally straightens out, we will have damaged all associations we have beyond repair.  

We'd like our children to be able to grow up having those relationships intact, and thus, we are turning to fundraising as a last resort to help keep us afloat until we can find our way back out of the woods.   

We are perfectly happy to provide any and all documentation of our situation, our bills, and my condition should it be required for acquiring any sort of assistance we may receive.  

If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading our story, and thank you in advance for any help you may be able to provide, or even for sharing our story with your friends.  

Much Love,

The Houck Family

,Help me raise some money to buy a PC to achieve my dreams in the IT field,"&#x200B;

I would be so grateful for the help because I will finally be able to step up my game and migrate to the 3D world and AI Deep Learning world.""

I'm just a teenager, I can't work to get the money, my parents won't help because they consider computers as ""Entertainment stations"" and me being an atheist and them being muslim doesn't help my cause, I'm badly treated and considered as a failure. I might sound like I'm lying because if you go through my reddit history you'll notice a lot of posts of me begging for a computer as university graduate but that was a failed tactic, i'm sorry for everything that I've done and posted in this lovely website. And yes you might also notice that I'm a pervert and that's 100% true. But I can't do much about it, I'm rejected by society. IT is my only escape, I would be so grateful for anything.

,Please help my girlfriend undergo spinal fusion surgery,"Hi! My name is Emmanuel and my girlfriend, Shayne, had an accident on the year 2017. She fell on her back down a flight of stairs on a bus going to work. Since that accident, she cannot stand and walk for too long as she experiences lower back pain and her left leg starts to numb. The day after her accident, we went to a spine specialist a hospital and she was diagnosed with Grade 2 spondylolisthesis and spondylosis and the proposed treatmnet by the doctor was to undergo spinal fusion surgery. The surgery would cost more or less $10,000 or PHP 500,000 but due to our current economic conditions there was no way we could get that amount of money so we went to a public (goverment owned) orthopedic hospital where she could get the spinal fusion surgery for on $1,600 or PHP 78,000 which would cover only the surgical rods and screws that will be used for the procedure as professional fees and all other costs will be covered by the government. Shayne and I humbly asks you guys to help us out with the $1,600 so she can have her quality of life back again. Her scheduled procedure will be on the last week of January. We would really appreciate all the help and I'll be willing to answer all your question for clarification.

,Help for Tilly,"Hi everyone, 

I really hate doing this, and I’ve never reached out to fellow Redditors for any type of assistance, however we’re in a bit of a bind.

Our German Shepherd has some type of fluid built up in her abdomen, and we’re not sure what it is. The vet could only do so much (to the tune of $695) and referred us to the emergency hospital, Veterinary Specialty of the Carolinas (the one located in Cary, NC). 
We were able to talk them into letting us get her admitted for $500 tonight, instead of driving yet another four hour round trip to try and get her in in the morning. She’ll be seeing a specialist tomorrow and having more lab work and tests done and an ultrasound... her estimated cost is between $1800-$2900.

If she wasn’t her normal self, besides the fluid build up, this wouldn’t even be a question, but she’s one of our children (our animals are the only “kids” we have) and neither of us can consciously just give up without trying. She’s been with us through so much; we got her right after we got married and moved, and she’s been there for every deployment and homecoming, and she’s my husbands best friend. 

Anything you can donate is so greatly appreciated. I’m willing to attach photos of her estimate, you can have the reference number for the account, whatever you need. I just wanna save her, or at least try to. She’s family, and I can’t give up on her that easily.

(Link is a photo of her on the way to the vet this afternoon before we got the bad news. I tried to hand write my username as best as I could.)

,My family still has no income and we've run out of food.,"I tried posting here asking for help last month but didn't get far. 

My family STILL has no source of income. My father lost his job back at the end of October and has not been able to get another since. I was bringing in money from my freelance art/writing gigs, but my computer's motherboard fried and now I'm having to borrow/share my nephew's with him on and off to try to get work.

We had to sell a lot of stuff and rely on some donations to be able to pay some of our bills (though a couple things got shut off and we had to pay to get them turned back on) but now we've been sent more bills.

**And on top of all of that; we've officially run out of food. All we have left in the house is some cooking oil, some condiments in the fridge, and the ice in the freezer.** 

We've tried going to the one food bank in our area but they require you be on some kind of government assistance program (which we applied to and got denied) in order to be given food (despite us having no money and no food...).

I was hoping to work to get enough money to buy another laptop but by this point I'm just praying we get enough to cover the basic utilities with some extra for food. So any help at all is appreciated!

,Help 5 kids burned out of home & homeless!," I’ve been coordinating help for this great family, 2 parents and 5 kids, who lost their apartment & belongings in a  fire right before Christmas. Due to the size of their family and HUD requirements that mandate a 4-BR for that many people, they are having a hard time finding  shelter without splitting up the family. When they came to my attention  the kids were split up among friends & neighbors and the parents  were sleeping in their van to save the Red Cross money for an eventual rent deposit. Here is news coverage:

[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fox5atlanta.com/news/apartment-fire-leaves-family-of-7-scrambling-to-find-shelter-ahead-of-christmas.amp](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fox5atlanta.com/news/apartment-fire-leaves-family-of-7-scrambling-to-find-shelter-ahead-of-christmas.amp)

I’ve  scrambled over $3k through churches & nonprofits to get them all together in a hotel through Christmas & first week of January. But after that I don’t know where they will go. They are trying to recreate  burned paperwork etc & are making headway, but with agencies being  closed, cold weather creating high demand for shelter, and their big  family it is going to be a long road. The dad works 2 jobs and the mom  takes care of one of the kids who has a serious chronic illness that requires frequent hospitalization. They are looking at places to rent all day today, and have good references & steady income, but it's gonna be a grind to find a place big enough and cheap enough.

Anyway  - I’d love to see their gofundme get more traction! They are trying SO hard to stay together, it would be an absolute crime if the parents had to split up and live 2 different places, or some of the kids had to find other places to live. Families need and deserve each other, especially in times of trauma. :(

,Declining Health and Need to Move,"I've copied and pasted the info from my GoFundMe, but [here's the link](https://www.gofundme.com/f/need-to-move-due-to-declining-health).  I also have a video at the bottom of my GoFundMe that shows me having a seizure.

It's  a long read, but if you don't fancy reading all of it the TL;DR is the  place we're living at is slowing killing us.  My doctors and counselor  have been urging us to move for awhile now.  The place my husband is  currently working at is a toxic environment that treats most of its employees like trash.  We're going to be moving in July 2020 when the  contract for our current place expires.

1.The place has been fraying on our health.  The air quality has me  messed up due to the fact people here would rather use wood-burning  fire places instead of cleaner safer options to heat their homes.  Fire  season has messed with my asthma, allergies, and done a number on my  anxiety and mental health.  The dry air hasn’t helped with my breathing;  I went from using my emergency inhaler maybe two or three times a year  to using it almost daily (and every time we leave the house).  My  husband’s allergies have gotten worse since moving here (his sister, who  convinced us to move here, said his allergies would basically vanish  here), resulting in a lot of headaches, frequently requiring a third and  even fourth allergy medication to control them (both meds make him  extremely drowsy).

I feel like I'm inhaling sand, and my lungs  feel like they're made of rice paper.  Within ten minutes of talking, my  voice is gone.  I'm easily winded, having a difficult time catching my  breath just walking across the house.  We have two air purifiers, but  with the air at barely 20% humidity (sometimes getting as low as 5%),  they tend to make the air drier.  UPDATE: \*I have two humidifier now,  one for the bedroom and one for the living room.  I'm able to do more in  my home now because of them, but going outside for more than a few  minutes is unacceptable according to my lungs.\*

Not only has this  affected my asthma and our allergies, but it's impacting my mental  health and epilepsy.  I've had PTSD since I was 18, made worse by the  house fire we survived in 2017 (I have an intense fear of fire).  I also  have severe general anxiety disorder, made worse by our current  situation.    Mental illness affects epilepsy, and my seizure count has  gone up.  My seizures will never be 100% controlled.  I've participated  in a seizure study and had a heavy-duty EEG.  From the study we learned I  don't qualify for surgery or seizure controlling implants.  I've been  on over 20 seizure medications since I was 11.  Many of these drugs are  blacklisted and have left me with permanent damaging side-effects.  I  have brain, nerve, and muscle damage from the thousands of seizures I've  had as well as injuries I sustained while having seizures.  I'm at high  risk of SUDEP (sudden unexpected death from epilepsy), made worse by  our current living situation.

2.  Rent is horrible here, and our  landlady keeps raising the rent every year. Finding a new place is  nearly impossible due to 1) high rental prices on very small places  ($800 for a 350 sq ft studio apartment) and 2) few places available (a  lot of people live in RVs because there’s nowhere else to live). When we  moved in to our current residence back in 2017 after a fire took our  previous home (yay for renter’s insurance) rent on this place was $900.  It’s now $1090 and she plans on raising it another 10% every year. If we  sign another contract for this place, rent will be $1110.  We can’t  afford it with my husband's current income and my SSDI (I'm permanently  disabled).

3.  Well-paying jobs are hard to find in even the  restaurant industry in our current location. They all want to start my  husband at state minimum wage.  He has 30 years working in the  restaurant industry; $12/hour isn't acceptable.  UPDATE: \*We've done a  lot of research, spoken to people who live on the west side of the  Cascades, and the happy news is he'll be able to find a job with general  ease and pay will be better.  He may even have a job waiting when we  move in July.  No certainties yet though.\*

4.  Finding good  doctors and counselors here that can provide me with the treatment I  need is difficult.  This is a rural region.  We have to drive over an  hour to get to my neurologist, who’s a very unpleasant doctor, but the  only neurologist who accept Medicare.  My primary physician is  well-loved and as such is booked with appointments going as far as six  months ahead.  It took almost five years to find a counselor who’s  qualified to treat me and accepts Medicare and Medicaid.  My primary  physician as well as my counselor have urged me to move to the other  side of the Cascades as soon as we are able.

5.  We have exactly  zero friends here.  The two we called friends are moving to the other  side of the Cascades by the end of November 2019.  One is the former  sous chef\*\* at the restaurant my husband works at, and the other is his  wife. They have family on the other side of the Cascades who will help  cover the cost of moving over their.

\*\*On November 2nd, 2019 the  sous chef at the restaurant my husband works at was fired.  The owner  told my husband he’s expected to work that job as well as his current  responsibilities (he currently works as the prep cook, handles all the  catering, as well as a providing lunch on a weekly basis to a local  construction area). Today the owner said the position will no longer  exist, he won’t get a promotion or pay raise, and that he needs to be a  “team member"". Husband is still going to work the job because he'll get  overtime every week and tip-outs from the servers.  UPDATE: \*His hours  have been cut from 40/week to 32/week.  He's going to speak to the owner  regarding this.

For several weeks he’s been looking for a better  job with better pay.  He has 30 years experience working in the  restaurant industry.  Earlier this year the head chef quit and someone  with very little experience and no management skills was promoted to the  position.  No one likes this guy, and he's been screwing everything  up.  Husband should have gotten that job, everyone but this guy feels  the same way, and the owner refuses to listen to reason.

The  owner claims to be a “good Christian” but is a hardcore capitalist and  treats his employees as slaves, giving raises only because the state has  increased the minimum wage. He’s raising wages a little bit every year  only because the state requires it, and would have everyone at minimum  wage if he could.

6.  Husband is on the verge of a psychotic  break from all the stress at work, finances, and taking care of me (I’m  disabled and he’s my official caretaker). I want to help with the  finances, and am doing my best by [making and selling quilts](https://www.etsy.com/shop/CreationsByChaosfay) .  Thus far I've had very little luck in regards to people actually buying my work.

7.  We generally hate the area and it benefits neither of us to remain  here. We simply can’t afford to actually move, but we know where we want  to move to (Springfield, Oregon, but currently living in Prineville,  Oregon).  There are well-paying jobs in that area, rent is affordable,  and the air quality is fantastic.

We’ll need a minimum of $3k.  Why? 

We  can’t physically pack and move everything ourselves.  Our physical  health will be put at serious risk of injury.  We have a lot of heavy  furniture and no one to help us pack and move it.   I cannot physically  help beyond packing smaller things and putting the boxes in piles for  Husband to move them with a dolly.  He will be doing all the heavy  lifting on his own, risking serious injury.  We need to hire  professionals or people in general to at least help us move everything  into a truck we rent.  UPDATE: \*Husband may have found the help we need  to load the truck, but we won't know for sure until July.\*

Then there’s the cost of the rental moving truck (U-Haul or Penske).

We’ll  likely put a lot of our things in storage and rent a smaller place if  we can’t find a place of similar size to what we’re living in now (a  double wide, 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom, trailer/manufactured home). Husband  says he’s fine with a one or two bedroom, and I’d get the largest  room/space for my sewing and home-activity stuff because I’m home 90% of  the time and need the space.

We also need to put money together  to apply for housing (prices range from $20/adult to $50/adult),  security deposit, and first month's rent. 

My SSDI (social  security disability income) is $752/month, which covers most of our  monthly bills, but not nearly enough to be livable or help out with the  move save for paying bills.

All funds selling my quilts will be applied to the move. The [stained glass quilt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/598118683/stained-blossoms-stained-glass-quilt)   would cover half the cost. If all the others sold before the move,  that'd be fabulous and take a lot of the stress off our shoulders."

,In college and I need a little help paying off the rest of my rent.," So I'm currently a Junior studying Computer Science. I have taken out loans that with some scholarships have helped me pay off my tuition. Paying for Housing has had to come out of pocket. My parents were able to help me in my first two years, however due to unforeseen circumstances, they weren't able to help as much as I possibly needed. I had a summer job and also got a job during the semester and it helped pay off most of it, but coming up to the end of the year I'm $250 short. I stay on campus so since I'm late they've put my account on hold and I can't even finish registering for classes. I've contacted all campus resources only to come to no avail since it's holiday season. I maxed out my only credit card partly due to housing and I can't get a loan or another credit card since my credit score isn't the best right now. I really don't have any other family in a position that could help me right now so this is my last resort. If I don't pay soon they'll change my lock until I'm able to pay for it. It'll be a while until I get paid because my on-campus job is closed for the holiday break.

I started a gofundme page with a picture of my most recent schedule so you'll have some type of proof I'm a college student with a quick explanation as well. Here's the link: [gf.me/u/w8xahh](https://gf.me/u/w8xahh)

I'd be grateful for anything whether it's just advice or helping me with my rent. If you prefer another method you can pm. Again thanks to anyone who sees this and gives a comment or an upvote. I hope you have a great day!"
,Help me not lose all my teeth before age 25,"I have a rare genetic mutation that causes, alongside other things, weakened teeth; I've also been on antidepressants for over a decade, and those weaken your teeth in and of themselves.  
  
Due to finances, I haven't had access to dental care with any kind of regularity since I was eight or nine; unfortunately, this has compounded my dental issues to a degree where even the most conservative approach still means I need two teeth pulled (not counting the two I had pulled a few years ago) and almost $25,000 of work done in total.  
This has been broken down into chunks based on priority by the dentist; the first bit of work totals out to almost $4,900, and the pipe dream hope is to have that money available so the work can be done before August 2020.

,My friend's birthday fundraiser for the Ocean Cleanup,"Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter the oceans, of which the majority spills out from rivers. A portion of this plastic travels to ocean garbage patches, getting caught in a vortex of circulating currents. If no action is taken, the plastic will increasingly impact our ecosystems, health, and economies.

Solving this problem requires a combination of closing the source and cleaning up what has already accumulated in the ocean and doesn’t go away by itself.

The Ocean Cleanup is developing a passive cleanup method, which uses the natural oceanic forces to rapidly and cost-effectively clean up the plastic already in the oceans. With a full fleet of cleanup systems in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, they aim to clean up 50% of its plastic every five years.

If successful they can make a real positive impact on the future of our world and the future of the world we leave behind for our kids.

My friend cares greatly for our world and wants nothing for her birthday but to be able to contribute to cleaning it up and hopefully reversing some of the damage that has already been done.

Please help make her birthday wish come true.

Thank you very much.

,Therapy fees for sexual assault,"Hello kind people of reddit. I want to ask for your help in paying my therapy fees. I was sexually assaulted when I was in college and have been struggling with PTSD and trauma ever since. The abuse took place 6 years ago and I just started going to therapy about a year ago. It is really helping, and I've been making a lot of progress, but still there is such, such a long way to go. 

Every day for the past 6 years I have been struggling with trauma, where my mind starts spinning out of control, and I cannot recover it until after its gone through its violent, haphazard turns. It was so bad that after college, when it happened, I stayed at my parents house for two years, not able to get my life together. I never told them or anyone else, except a few friends, about what happened, because it is too embarrassing and shameful. About a year and a half ago I decided to make a change and move out of my parents house and get my life together. I started looking for a job, and did lyft while I was looking. I eventually started going to therapy. The therapy sessions really helped and I formed a close bond of trust and understanding with my therapist. But it was hard to do lyft because the trauma would get really bad while I was driving. After about 6 months from starting therapy, I finally found a job, but since the therapy firm has a sliding scale fee, the fees went up when I found the job.

I am currently getting help from CalVCB, a victims of crime compensation board, but they cannot pay the entire amount, and also after about a year they will be unable to pay for my sessions any longer. My insurance is a high deductable plan, so they won't start paying for the sessions until 6 months into the year, and they can only cover half the cost after. If you could kindly donate or share my link to my gofundme page, I would truly love and appreciate it. This has been something I've been struggling with non-stop on a daily basis. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Any small help would go a long way for me.

,Help for disabled mom,"https://www.gofundme.com/House-for-disabled-mom-with-Lupus

my name is Jordan I am asking for help! We are currently trying to raise money for myself and my Mom. My mom is very ill she has been in the hospital all more than she has been out this year. She has lupus and it is attacking her organs. She was recently moved home from nursing to home palliative care (hospice) so she could be at home with her family. She is in congestive heart failure kidney failure and has to have 24/7 care. Our current living conditions are dire because we have over several stairs (about 18) that mom can’t get up or down to get to much needed doctors visits and other therapy to help extend possibly improve her life. I am afraid she will die in this house because if something critically happened to her the time it would take paramedics to get her out of the house (down the stairs) and to help would be so time consuming she would die or, these are the exact words of her palliative care doctor, if there was a fire she wouldn’t be able to get out on her own in a timely manner that she would likely perish in the fire.

&#x200B;

Hello Reddit, my name is Joseph Ramirez, and I'm 24 years old living in North Dakota. I recently was hired on to a new job, and made the mistake of leaving my old job too quickly. My previous employment was stressful and unpleasant, and after landing my much better position I was very eager to leave. I had money saved up but I overestimated how much, and now I am in desperate need of help making my rent for the month of January. 

I don't start my new job until the 6th of January and I likely won't receive a paycheck until mid-to-late Jan, and by that point I'll be facing eviction. Right now, all I need is $550 to make my rent for the month of January. I can push back most of my other bills to after my first paycheck, but my complex is ruthless about making rent on time. I've tried asking friends (I'm estranged from my family) but everyone I know is broke for one reason or another, and with my credit score is in the toilet (see the estranged from my family line for a hint as to why) I've been rejected for multiple loans. I'm out of options, so Reddit is my hail mary. I've been through numerous evictions growing up, and I'm terrified of being put in that position again.  

Anything you can spare to help me would be appreciated. I know I made a mistake, but I don't know what else to do to fix it. 

Thank you"

,Raising the last $150 for my spring tuition," Hello all,

I'm  a student at the University of Georgia studying Environmental Economics  and I'm trying to raise $150 to cover the last part of my tuition that I  just don't have. I've already sold my non-essential possessions, and  have taken out as much financial aid as I can. My job as a culinary  assistant for the University is closed during the holidays, so I won't  get a paycheck before the tuition bill is due. The $150 I'm short comes  from the University adding more facility fees. I explain it in much  greater depth on the GoFundMe page, linked here: [gf.me/u/w9qbxk](https://gf.me/u/w9qbxk).  I'd really appreciate any donation given, no matter how small cause  every little bit helps. If you can't or don't want to give anything  sharing this link is extremely helpful as well. This is my first time  posting here, so I hope I've formatted everything correctly.  Thanks for taking the time to read this, and have an awesome day."

On the first week of october, i feel a lump on my neck and it was a pea size and the lump on my armpit got bigger also. I called the doctor and he said that i really need to get a lab tests to determine my condition and we need to prepare a large amount of money for all the medical tests and for the possible surgery. The doctor said my case was rare and its a immediate medical care. I don't have health insurance and here in the philippines we don't have foundation that will help you with your medical test bill. We also talked to our government to ask for help but they said they can't help me due to the limited funds. I really got no choice but to create this fundraising to have a money for my medical tests.

Please help me and my family. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

,Service dog for a college student in need,"Hellp eveyone! I am sharing my story with all of yall today, beacuse truly any little bit helps me out.

As of recently, my health has declined. It started out with my first fainting episode roughly 4 years ago, and from then to now, I pass out roughly 2 or 3 times a week. Mixed in there is also chronic pains in my hips, knees, wrist and ankles. I have gone through intensive medical testing, and doctors have no been able to diagnose me.

As a college student, this has impacted my life harshly. I've had to quit my favorite sports, drop out of classes, quit my job as a teacher, and miss out on spending time with family and freinds. My life as an independent young women has become compromised. I fear going out alone. 

Discussing with family and my medical team, we've come to the conclusion that a service dog is the right path for me. This dog is crucial to my independence, and for my well being. More details on my story are on my GoFundMe page. 

Thank you so much to eveyone that reads this post, even if donations can't be made, a share is just as helpful!!

My wife found a place to work in the time being, but the positions she can attain are nowhere near what I normally make. Therefore, we are drowning in bills.

I'm almost healed and about ready to get back to work. However, that money won't come soon enough.

I need to pay this months utilities, next months rent (due Jan. 1st), and part of next months utilities.

I'm on the verge of tears just writing this. It's a terrible feeling to be in this position. I feel like I'm failing my family and I hate having to ask for money, but I see no other option as of this moment.

My wife and I have two children ages 3 and 1.

,Need help raising money for a car to commute to work,"I am trying to raise money to get a car after my last car ended up getting repo’d. 
Having to rely on the bus sucks because often times I don’t get off work until midnight. When I get off work I have to wait an hour for my bus. It takes about an hour in a half to get to the other side of town then I have to walk 45 minutes home when it’s usually a 35 minute drive home. On the weekends the buses run every hour in a half by my place and trying to do anything like grocery shopping is a mission and has me limited to where I can go. Taking the bus to my girlfriends house is a 2 in a half hour commute with 3 transfers but when driving it’s usually 30-40 minute drive. Having a car will help me tremendously so I can commute back and forth to work.

Hello there:    


My name is Sydney.  I'm a wife, and a mother, heading up a small family of four that cannot seem to escape the crisis in which we find ourselves.    


I have a treatable, but not curable genetic, auto-inflammatory condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa (Stage 3).  You can research it, but in simple terms, it's a condition that causes large, painful, non-healing abscesses and lesions across all parts of the body that houses apocrine sweat glands (under arms, over thighs, genitals, buttocks, down legs, etc).  At Stage 3, tracts form under the skin, in thick, rope-like formations that travel between the abscesses.    


To say that this condition isn't a pleasure to live with would be the understatement of the century.  Every day is spent in a constant agony that I cannot begin to describe, and because of the extremely painful nature of H.S., I cannot work, or properly care for my young children, (ages 1 and 2).    


I am currently undergoing treatment that should, in time, render me more able to at least make myself useful around the house, and a better part of our children's care, and would also enable us to find adequate work.  That said, recovery and management is an incredibly long road ahead of us (estimated to be about 6-7 months in total for this treatment to be completed), and therefore, we need help to make ends meet with our healthcare and living expenses, which run around $1.500 per month.    


Up until now, we've been relying on my meager earnings as a 3D Animator (the only real work that I'm capable of doing, as it only requires me to use a computer from home), and assistance from family.  This situation is putting an incredible strain on those relationships, and we fear that by the time our situation finally straightens out, we will have damaged all associations we have beyond repair.    


We'd like our children to be able to grow up having those relationships intact, and thus, we are turning to fundraising as a last resort to help keep us afloat until we can find our way back out of the woods.     


We are perfectly happy to provide any and all documentation of our situation, our bills, and my condition should it be required for acquiring any sort of assistance we may receive.    


If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading our story, and thank you in advance for any help you may be able to provide, or even for sharing our story with your friends.    


Much Love,  


The Houck Family"

,My best friend's 5 year old son is unexpectedly going blind after realizing his vision issues were misdiagnosed 4 years ago. Please help this family and the unexpected costs that come with this.,"Hello!

My best friend's 5-year old son, David, was misdiagnosed when he was 9 months old with Hyperopia (far-sightedness) and Congenital Nystagmus (Uncontrollable shaking of the eyes)

They flew David to a specialist in California (we live in Minnesota) to help fix his Nystagmus. They received the news that David does not have Nystagmus and was misdiagnosed when he was an infant. The shaking of his eyes is a side effect of a serious, progressive eye condition called Retinal Dystrophy, which results in blindness.

It took them 5 months of visiting specialists and having tests and procedures performed to receive a proper diagnosis for David. He has Leber Congenital Amaurosis (a form of Retinal Dystrophy) caused by a rare genetic mutation (CRB1 gene).

There is currently no approved treatment for this diagnosis, and they don't know how quickly he'll lose his vision. His vision loss is already progressing, though.

It starts by taking away his peripheral vision, which he already has lost. Next, he'll lose the ability to see colors. Recently, he stopped being able to see the color blue. Finally, his central vision will be lost.

All in the midst of this, David's mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and is currently undergoing treatment for it.
Her main concern continues to be David and wanting to help him in any way that she can.

They have a large amount of debt due to medical bills, and also have to make their house more accessible for David as he loses his vision.

Please visit the site to read more about their story, where the money will go, share their story, and consider donating!

,"Best Friends Family Car Crash; 4 year old dead, 17 year old paralyzed, 10 year old in a coma","I also posted this in r/gofundme. Just trying to raise awareness for the family.

The best friend I have, Athena, she is so kind and sweet, selfless. Her family had just had a car accident with a reckless driver. Her cousins Destiny and Emilio are in the hospital. Emilio could be paralyzed and Destiny is currently in the hospital with broken bones and burns, in a coma. Her mother Amanda, grandma Donna, and another cousin Layla who was four died. Poor Destiny is only 10 and dealing with the losses after she wakes up will be hard for her. Amanda was 29 and Donna was 48. Emilio is 17, just a kid and is losing his ability to walk. He has his whole life ahead of him. My friend Athena and her family is dealing with these losses. The fundraiser is to pay for funeral cost and extra is going to hospital costs for Destiny and Emilio.

Layla didn’t need to die, Donna didn’t need to die, Amanda with her 2 children, didn’t need to die. Destiny and Emilio didn’t need to go through this. Athenas family doesn’t need this. Think before you drive drunk or recklessly. You may cause another situation like this to occur. More Destiny’s, Emilio’s, Athena’s, Layla’s. Do YOU want to cause the death of a little girls family? Destiny is in a COMA, she is on the BRINK of death. I knew this girl. She was sweet and energetic, always bouncing with energy. Her smile was so kind. She was brave too, she will pull through, that brave little girl. I didn’t know Layla, but she was FOUR, she didn’t deserve to die. None of these people deserved to die. This kind and thoughtful family didn’t deserve this. Athena’s dad has gone through 2 accidents already, and now the loss of his sister and her family.

,A family in need,"My best friend knows my struggles lately and took it upon himself to create a gofundme for my family and our current struggles. 

As the title says, I am a veteran, I'm also disabled with my neck, shoulders and upper back suffering from muscle spasms, nerve pain and early onset of degenerative arthritis due to an injury suffered in basic training. I've put it all on the line for this country and in turn, I'm getting shafted by the VA. I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD and extreme depression with suicidal tendencies/thoughts. The VA is naturally taking their time in approving my disability and paying me. In the meantime, bill collectors don't care about your troubles. My wife is currently struggling with back injuries from a past car crash and recurring mental problems from past trauma. 

Due to my injuries, she is the only worker in the household and we barely scrape by. It has gotten to the point of us taking out multiple credit cards just to cover basic needs. If not for my buddy helping us in the past, I'm positive we would be homeless right now.

I know money is tight for everyone, especially this time of year. All I'm asking is to please look and if you can spare a buck or two, every little bit helps us. A share is free and even that small gesture is greatly appreciated.

From my family to all of yours, have a safe and happy new year.

,HELP YOUNG ADULTS WITH CANCER!❤💜,"(Please donate to the Ulman Foundation, help support me, and assist many young adults battling with cancer! Link below!)

I have decided to embark on the journey of a lifetime! This summer I am planning on running four-thousand miles across the country, relay-style, with 25-30 other college kids! This journey will be a life-changing 49-day experience allowing me to test myself physically, meet people that I would normally never get the chance to meet, and spread happiness among many cancer patients.

I will gladly accept any size donation, large or small, to help me reach my required fundraising goal of $4,500 for the fight against cancer! 90% of the donations will go directly towards supporting young adults battling with cancer and 10% will go towards travel management and costs for the run. If you are unable to donate I would appreciate it if you shared my page with all your family and friends. Thank you for your consideration and support. I hope to bring smiles to many faces along the way!

,REPOST- Colombian International Student in Canada About To Be Deported Over Student Visa - Please Help!,"Hi there everyone. I am back trying to help a friend of mine who is facing down some really big problems right now. Neither of us are the best when it comes to social media so please bear with me.

Paula and I both work in the film industry in Vancouver BC, and she is something else. She came from Colombia to Canada to study and join our film industry. She has somehow managed to work up to 3+ jobs at once AND go to Capilano University where she is absolutely kicking ass in one of the top film programs in the country. I have not met many people who can hope to match how determined she is and has proven herself to be.

That all being said, Paula needs our help.

\*\*You can follow her story on the GoFundMe link below, if you would prefer a primary description of events.\*\*

Paula is staring down having to leave Canada (and her education) soon despite being very close to graduating (April). Due to political unrest and financial issues related to the economy at home in Colombia, and despite doing everything a person in her position could do to pay her own way, she needs to raise A LOT of tuition money very quickly (by the end of December) if she wants to continue with her career and life here - which I assure you is in the best interests of everybody fortunate enough to have the opportunity to get to know her (much less work with her, holy cow). She also has already had someone hack her facebook to try and steal what we have already raised, so she could use a break :/

I think Paula’s situation is incredibly unfortunate, and the scale of her conviction to overcome it is something unique.

I’d be hard-pressed to name another cause that deserves your support more than this one right now, because honestly Paula embodies a certain type of spirit and determination that doesn’t come around every day.

Whether you can donate or you know another way to help, this is one of those rare occasions where you can truly feel certain that you are doing something positive - not just for Paula, but for my country of Canada honestly. She deserves to be here, and trust me when I say that we as Canadians want what she brings to the table when it comes to work ethic and creativity. She isn’t even asking for the full amount, cause she’s freaking crazy determined to do it with or without us.

I’d like it to be with us. She’s the definition of a hard-working Canadian. So help me help her, let’s show her how Canada gets down when someone fights this hard and needs our help.

If you are Canadian, or you understand what I mean, then this one is for you.

,Help my friend escape abusive family and unsafe living situation,"Hi everyone. I'm posting this on behalf of my friend since there isn't much I can do by myself. Her parents were abusive and still financially abuse her. Because of that she couldn't afford to live in a dorm and had to stay with a foster family that ended up being incredibly hostile and one of the men sexually harrased her, which other family members brushed off. Her parents won't give her money to move out. She had effectively no savings cause her parents never gave her more that the bare minimum needed to survive. I wish I could help but I'm a student as well and don't have that much money at my disposal. Ideally she'd like to move to Europe but getting 300 dollars for a new place to live would be a good start. Here's her full story: 

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-with-escaping-abusive-household

Hi, my name is Lisa - I’m a 19 years old girl who’s living in an extremely abusive household. 

My parents are stalking all of my social media, so I was very hesitant at making a fundraiser and posting this online, but the situation is getting worse and I’m getting desperate and need as much help as I can get; I also can’t use my actual birth name since I’m paranoid of them finding out about this. 

The only thing that is stopping me from moving out and cutting connection with my family is that I am financially dependent on them, and I have nowhere and no one to go; due to them abusing me mentally, emotionally, and physically, I was never able to get a job, as I also wasn’t allowed to have a bank account on my own.

My story as short as possible: I currently am an international student in Canada, and I am studying a one-year program, after what my parents expect me to immediately get a job and live on my own here. 

The reason why I’m here is that they want me to get a Canadian citizenship by studying so they’d be able to immigrate through me as well, which have put a lot of pressure onto me, and being afraid of failing their expectations of me resulted in me developing severe depression. 

I don’t have any friends or relatives here, as integrating into a whole new different society without anyone I know by my side, all alone ever since I’ve arrived here, with no support system at all, resulted in me developing a severe anxiety and social phobia. 

They also didn't want to pay for the college dorms, so I had to stay at a forest family here, - yesterday I was verbally sexually harassed by one of the family members, asking me invasive and inappropriate questions about my personal life, and in the end I was being told to “show my body more, since I’m so pretty”. When I told about this to the homeowner, I was told that I am lying, that it was a misunderstanding because I have a broken English (the man who harassed me told me that I have a very good English himself), and I need to pack my bags and get out of the house.
As very stressed and frustrated, I had to apologize for “creating the misunderstanding”, so I would be left alone, but this man is still in this house with me. I feel very scared for my life as I am all alone here, there’s no one to stand up for me, and since I live in their house as an international student, they're free to do anything they want with me, it’s their word against mine.

I cant ask my family to move me to a different household since they would just get mad at me for wasting their money, I’ll have to go through their verbal harassment, and they would just tell me to suck it up because they don’t care about anything but me staying as long as I can to get them goddamn citizenship no matter what. So I’m stuck at a place I feel myself unsafe, surrounded by hostile people, and have no one around.

I am not being allowed to apply to any other school or university in a different place, to a program I like, - creative writing; I am an aspired writer and author who’d like to get more knowledge and experience, I am eager to learn, I want to make a difference in the world with my work. 

I know that staying in Canada far away from my family is my best shot at breaking free, but I am not able to get any mental health help here as my parents send me very limited amount of money to live on every month that can only cover the cost of groceries, and I hate feeling helpless that I have no other options other than staying here, with no one I know around and with my mental condition getting worse every day, or going back home, where I know for sure I’d be done for good. 

What I need is to get enough money on getting a European visa to get to my relative living in Netherlands, for a flight ticket, and money to cover for my expenses, health issues, and to save sum up for my future education.  

Any donations will greatly help me to break free from my abusive family’s control and influence, and everything counts and means the world to me."
,Help My Partner and I Fix Our Car,"My partner and I need to get our car street legal, it's his only way to get to work without spending 4+ hours on public transit.

There's more info in the link, but essentially we need money to get insurance, for my partner to get an updated license [we just moved to new jersey], and for him to get his car checked out, because it's been making some weird sounds and acting up recently.

,Please help us! We've exhausted every other option we can think of.,"My wife and I were finally able to achieve our dream of moving to Washington State. I had a job lined up. Unfortunately, when we were moving into our new place I fractured my leg. This has prevented me from working. My wife found a place to work in the time being, but the positions she can attain are nowhere near what I normally make. Therefore, we are drowning in bills.

I'm almost healed and about ready to get back to work. However, that money won't come soon enough.

I need to pay this months utilities, next months rent (due Jan. 1st), and part of next months utilities. 

I'm on the verge of tears just writing this. It's a terrible feeling to be in this position. I feel like I'm failing my family and I hate having to ask for money, but I see no other option as of this moment.

My wife and I have two children ages 3 and 1. 

I would be eternally grateful for any help received. 

In the future, when we are in a better position, we'll be sure to pay it forward especially this time of year.

The doctor said my case was rare and its a immediate medical care. I don't have health insurance and here in the philippines we don't have foundation that will help you with your medical test bill. We also talked to our government to ask for help but they said they can't help me due to the limited funds. I really got no choice but to create this fundraising to have a money for my medical tests.

,Help Grant Dotson beat cancer!,"In January 2019 our friend Grant Dotson was diagnosed with stage 4A rectal cancer which had
metastasized to over 60% of his liver. This was quite a shock to Grant and his attending doctors
considering his young age and the fact that there is no family history of cancer. Fortunately,
Grant was healthy enough to qualify for the most aggressive forms of treatment available. 2019
has been a year of continual treatments and surgeries with only enough downtime to recover
and rest for the next round.
He's had great response to the treatments which have killed 75% of the cancer in the liver,
rectum and affected lymph nodes. Initially doctors weren't sure he would have enough liver to
survive once they removed the cancerous parts of the organ. By the grace of God, Grant's liver
started growing on its own during chemotherapy and they were able to remove the damaged
liver with no issues or complications. Doctors are stunned how well everything has progressed
this year.
Grant is in great spirits and is determined to win this battle but he has a long way to go. It's been
over a year since he's been able to work and while he does have medical insurance, as
everyone has experienced, insurance does not cover all expenses. The additional costs that
come with treating this horrible disease (while not being able to generate income) continue to
accrue. Please consider donating and/or sharing this post so we can get him 100% healthy
again and help offset out of pocket treatment costs.

,Help school children learn about Native American culture,"My wife is a teacher at a school where they’re raising money to help students go on a field trip to Tillicum Village.

With the help of a grant they've gotten the cost of the field trip down significantly, but there's more costs to cover. Their current goal is $850, which would lower the cost of the field trip down to just $10 per student.

,Giving to a family in need,"2019 has been quite the rollercoaster. I learned so much about who I am and how to be a better person in my own family. I have learned how to be a better partner to my wife, how to be a better person to my friends , and how to be a better father to my three wonderful children.

I quit my job back in September. I realized that I had some severe PTSD from my work environment. I worked as a rigger for a decade. I loved being a rigger. Being able to move large items from point a to point b in the environment that I worked in was often a challenge I was more than willing to put a forward thinking attitude towards. It was amazing some of the things that I’ve done. With that being said, the people were more often than not horrible human beings. I had a second level supervisor one time tell me that I was making his cancer worse because of the stress I had caused him. I had been working 12hr night shifts for a month and filling in as a first level supervisor. At the beginning of the shift, at a supervisor meeting, I was given an at-a-boy for all the work my crew and myself was getting done. This kind of crap was often my experience. 

I took out my retirement. My wife quit her job a month later from the same place. She filled a bunch of harassment charges and because all of them were legit, there has been a lot of witnesses coming forward and corrective actions still happening in December as a result.

So here is the deal and the reason for the post, I’m out of retirement money, I have little money for rent. I’ve been applying for jobs left and right. I’ve been looking for other means of financial assistance. I keep re-writing me resume to refine it and make it more worthwhile to any employers I’m actively seeking work with but to no end. Basically, I’m looking for help in my time of need. If you can help, that would be wonderful. If you have any ideas of other resources that would help, I would love to hear about that too. 

Tl;dr - I need help with rent. Any other help with resources would be great too. My family thanks you for any help.

&#x200B;

My name is Sydney.  I'm a wife, and a mother, heading up a small family of four that cannot seem to escape the crisis in which we find ourselves.    


I have a treatable, but not curable genetic, auto-inflammatory condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa (Stage 3).  You can research it, but in simple terms, it's a condition that causes large, painful, non-healing abscesses and lesions across all parts of the body that houses apocrine sweat glands (under arms, over thighs, genitals, buttocks, down legs, etc).  At Stage 3, tracts form under the skin, in thick, rope-like formations that travel between the abscesses.    


To say that this condition isn't a pleasure to live with would be the understatement of the century.  Every day is spent in a constant agony that I cannot begin to describe, and because of the extremely painful nature of H.S., I cannot work, or properly care for my young children, (ages 1 and 2).    


I am currently undergoing treatment that should, in time, render me more able to at least make myself useful around the house, and a better part of our children's care, and would also enable us to find adequate work.  That said, recovery and management is an incredibly long road ahead of us (estimated to be about 6-7 months in total for this treatment to be completed), and therefore, we need help to make ends meet with our healthcare and living expenses, which run around $1.500 per month.    


Up until now, we've been relying on my meager earnings as a 3D Animator (the only real work that I'm capable of doing, as it only requires me to use a computer from home), and assistance from family.  This situation is putting an incredible strain on those relationships, and we fear that by the time our situation finally straightens out, we will have damaged all associations we have beyond repair.    


We'd like our children to be able to grow up having those relationships intact, and thus, we are turning to fundraising as a last resort to help keep us afloat until we can find our way back out of the woods.     


We are perfectly happy to provide any and all documentation of our situation, our bills, and my condition should it be required for acquiring any sort of assistance we may receive.    


If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading our story, and thank you in advance for any help you may be able to provide, or even for sharing our story with your friends.    


Much Love,

,"My friend's mother is facing multiple unforeseen expenses at once, including medical debt. Any help would be greatly appreciated!","Hi there, my friend and her family have hit a rough patch and could really use some financial assistance. 

Here's my friend's description of the situation:

""My mom's plumbing went out, health problems came up, and her work didn't give her a bonus that she needed to afford anything for Christmas, including the basics, like food and a few decorations. If you have a dollar you could contribute so I could help her out a bit, that would be so amazing. I don't like to ask for money; my family taught me to never accept charity. But at this point, I'm desperate to help her feel better.""

,Good place to donate hair,"I've been donating my hair for about 8 years (2 year intervals to grow)  and I've always gone to Locks for Love. I've heard very mixed opinions on them,  and was wondering if I should continue going through them or find another charity? 

Your suggestions are much appreciated!"
,My father broke his leg. He has been off work for weeks and has run out of PTO. He does not have short-term disability.,"Asking for help is never easy, but sometimes it’s gotta be done. My family and I are asking for donations for my parents for medical costs and cost of living

A few months ago, my dad was at a friend’s house, walking outside. He slipped and fell, and his leg bent the wrong way and broke. He broke both his fibula and tibia. Since about mid-October, he has been totally home-bound. He can’t leave the house for work, as my parents live in a split level house. For the first two months, he was not allowed to put an ounce of weight on his foot. He's now able to put some weight on it, but he is still in a boot and only able to move around with the help of a walker.

My mother had to stay home with him for about two months. She only had two weeks worth of PTO to get them by, with the help of my dad's PTO. She is now back at work while she maintains the household and cares for my dad.

There have already been numerous costs associated with the adjustment. Thankfully, my hardworking father had over 200 hours of PTO saved up, which is just shy of 5 weeks’ worth. However, we’re short of what we need. He’s potentially home bound until January 15th (for 12 weeks total), assuming all goes well. He may not be walking normally again until well into the new year. He does not qualify for social security disability, and he has neither short-term disability insurance nor accident insurance.

The hospital bills have yet to roll in. My dad’s recovery has included multiple visits to the doctor, one cast, one boot, and one surgery to put a bar and 5 screws into his leg. We’re really just waiting now for the official total (so the total goal may raise), and we know we’re going to need your help.

Growing up, my parents were essentially everyone's parents. Each and every friend my brother and I brought through the door were immediately adopted under their wings and given a chair around our dinner table. We ate dinner together as a family every single night, and our friends were no exception to that rule. Each and every friend was probably given a lecture or two about something or the other, but they were also met with great big bear hugs and lots of love, no matter their choices and opinions.

My parents have given so much love over the years. They continue to do so every day. They have done everything they can to give my brother and I every opportunity to succeed, explore, and learn. They have been an ear I've talked off about high school, college, and now adult woes. They have been my stability and my strength when I have struggled or floundered. They have always been our #1 cheerleaders, reminding us every day that we can do anything if we put in the work, that we are capable of greatness and of kindness, and that we are the most stellar children we can be to them.

They have reminded me time and time again about just how much I have to give to the world and how much strength I have inside of me as I charge (or sometimes crawl) through every obstacle life has thrown my way. They have been my strength and my reason for carrying on when I have felt like I no longer could.

I want so desperately to give every ounce of that love back to them and tell them thank you. I wish I could scoop them up into my arms and tell them each and every bill has been paid by the magic of the internet. Please help me make that possible for them.

We have raised a total of $870 with the addition of checks that have come in. If you have not received a handwritten thank you note from me, please send me a message, because I truly want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping my family.

I wish you all lots of love this Christmas season and ask you to share some giving spirit. I have made this post public so it can be shared everywhere. Thank you, friends.

,My brother broke his back and is a type 1 diabetic. He does not have health insurance. Please help us meet our goal so that he can make a successful recovery.,"[Here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-luke-driscoll?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1) is his GoFundMe page.

My brother, Luke, is an avid snowboarder, rock climber, and dog lover. He lives in Denver Colorado where he works as a full time bartender. He spends his free time with his two dogs, Zeke and Bear, hiking the Rockies of Colorado, snowboarding in the winter and rock climbing in the summer. He is also very supportive of his step brother, who recently had identical twin boys, and looks forward to Luke's help and companionship.

On Friday, December 13, 2019, Luke was snowboarding at Keystone Mountain, where he also works, when he had a bad fall resulting in multiple fractures of his spine. He landed face down and his legs came up over his back, compressing his vertebrae. The mechanism of injury is referred to as a ""Scorpion"" because it looks similar to a scorpion's tail over it's head. The resulting injury completely compressed his L1 vertebrae, and caused other fractures at T7, T8, T12 and L2. Miraculously, he escaped any significant spinal cord damage.

Initially he was unable to be med-evaced from the mountain due to a snowstorm that had the interstate closed and grounded the helicopter. After the storm subsided, he was transferred to St Anthony Hospital in Lakewood, Colorado where he underwent a 10 hour spinal surgery to fuse his vertebrae, insert pins and screws, and decompress an epidural hematoma. Currently, he is in the ICU, wearing a spinal brace, and will be in Physical and Occupational Therapy for weeks to come. 

Unfortunately, Luke has no health insurance and struggles on a monthly basis simply to pay for the insulin to treat his type 1 diabetes. His medical bills will be staggering, and he has no ability to earn a living at this time. This time of year, working as a bartender at a Vail ski resort would have been his greatest opportunity to earn and save. I am asking for donations to help him pay his hospital expenses, and his cost of living over the next few months as he rehabilitates and learns to live with his injuries, returns to work and hopefully to the climbing and snowboarding he loves. "

,My girlfriend and I got disowned and desperately need financial help,"
Hey everyone! 


My girlfriend and I have been disowned by her parents this week and are reaching out desperately for financial support. We are both college students and they have cutoff support for tuition, healthcare, (she is having a lot of heart issues this year), and living. This is her goFundme message:

My name is Rachel and I am currently a junior at Colorado State University and I'm studying accounting and history. I'm hoping to be able to finish my undergraduate degree in accounting to help me go into law school to pursue corporate or tax law. Unfortunately though, I recently had a falling out with my parents who used to help me pay the up-front tuition bills since it is hard for me to take thousands out of my savings at one time. They no longer associate with me because I am moving in with my boyfriend of two years and they believe it is immoral and a bad path. I have also been struggling with a lot of health issues with my heart this semester, which have made it harder for me to work consistent hours being in and out of the hospital. Now that I don't have a support system, I can't afford my medical bills and my tuition in January. If I could receive even a little bit of support I would really appreciate it, I don't necessarily need the whole sum! It's always been my dream to go to law school, as you can see that is me in high school lettering in speech and debate! :) I'm really hoping to receive help to stay in school and also get my health back on track, I would appreciate anything that I could get! Thank you so much even for just reading this, any support means the world to me. I am a very dedicated student and have had five internships already. I currently have two jobs and would not take any help that I receive for granted. Thank you!!!

,Please consider helping Virginie and her family with her medical expenses,"One of my friend's has the most wonderful sister and family, and they are struggling to keep up with medical expenses. Here's an excerpt from the GoFundMe page: 

>Virginie has been poked and prodded more times than I can count and has suffered from crippling pain for much too long. All I wish for my sister is to be able to have the remaining surgeries she needs in order to function more or less like a “normal” human being.  
  
>  
>Truthfully, she’s missed enough of her teenage years and nearly all of her 20’s. She has so much to offer this world and I know she wants to dedicate her journey to helping others also suffering through chronic disease. 

V needs multiple surgeries for her medical conditions. Her intestines are malformed to the point the surgeon wouldn’t feel it safe to perform all he needs to do in just one surgery because it would put too much physical stress on her body... Especially because Lyme disease already weakens her body’s ability to recover normally.

To add more insult to injury, Virginie will also need a separate surgery to perform a Fundoplication which is a surgical method for treating gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Not only does GERD cause her to vomit foods/drinks she just consumed back into her mouth… it also causes inflammation, pain, and can lead to serious complications (such as scarring and stricture) of the esophagus. Her constant state of inflammation also elevates her LDL cholesterol which poses other problems. 

Any help you can give by donating or sharing V's story would be a huge help. Thank you so much for reading.

,Cross Post. Homeless tomorrow (again) was suggested sub by another,"Hello. I was told about this Sub after a post on SuicideWatch.

My situation. I've Aspergers, Agoraphobia and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I get 770$/Month in SSI. Enough to pay for a place but not meet income requirements. I had been doing 3 days on street, 1 day in hotel. I got sick of that, so this month I did 3 weeks upfront, been selling plasma to add days. Applied to every fast food, every retail in area. I'm enrolled in 2 temp agencies. After 3 weeks I'm seeing jobs, but they all need PPe & STBoots.

My hotel is up tomorrow at 11. I dont have a car, I have 0 friends BC of being so introverted as well as the last 4 years of my life have been ""well. If we talk they'll ask about my life and I either lie or make things depressing and awkward"" so i haven't attempted to make friends lately, despite being less anxious in sense I could work and interact. I had pulled all of my clothes and my little free weights set from storage to both save $50 this month on unit fee as well as I had been exercising to get back to working shape. No choice but to toss all of it tomorrow.

This is a mess and In sorry. Stream of consciousness as well as not really sure what to post or say. Was directed here as a recommendation, so not overly familiar w the sub besides the rules I just read.

Ty for time, sorry for format/grammar. On phone and, well, in an ""odd"" mind set atm.

Feel free to ask whatever

Edit: I dont know how to be homeless. Cops here are strict. Arrest if you dont move along. I dont sleep. I drink Bang, coffee and pop energy capsules and walk nonstop. That was also why my ""3 days out 1 day in hotel"" formed. I've no backpack or foodstamps this time and I just... well. That's why I'm here."
,Colombian International Student In Canada About To Lose Student Visa Over Tuition Hardships Mere Months Before Graduating (Crosspost from r/GoFundMe),"Hi there everyone. I am trying to help a friend of mine who is facing down some really big problems right now. Neither of us are the best when it comes to social media so please bear with me.

Paula and I both work in the film industry in Vancouver BC, and she is something else. She came from Colombia to Canada to study and join our film industry. She has somehow managed to work up to 3+ jobs at once AND go to Capilano University where she is absolutely kicking ass in one of the top film programs in the country. I have not met many people who can hope to match how determined she is and has proven herself to be.

That all being said, Paula needs help.

\*\*You can follow her story directly on the GoFundMe link below, if you would prefer a primary description of events\*\*

Paula is staring down having to leave Canada (and her education) soon despite being very close to graduating (April). Due to political unrest and financial issues related to the economy at home in Colombia, and despite doing everything a person in her position could do to pay her own way, she needs to raise A LOT of tuition money very quickly if she wants to continue with her career and life here - which I assure you is in the best interests of everybody fortunate enough to have the opportunity to get to know her (much less work with her, holy cow). She also had someone hack her facebook earlier this week to try and steal what she has already raised, so she could use a break :/

I think Paula’s situation is incredibly unfortunate, and the scale of her conviction to overcome it is something unique.

I’d be hard-pressed to name another cause that deserves your support more than this one right now, because honestly Paula embodies a certain type of spirit and determination that doesn’t come around every day.

Whether you can donate or you know another way to help, this is one of those rare occasions where you can truly feel certain that you are doing something positive - not just for Paula, but for Canada honestly. She deserves to be here, and trust me when I say that we as Canadians want what she brings to the table when it comes to work ethic and creativity. She isn’t even asking for the full amount, cause she’s freaking crazy determined to do it with or without us.

I’d like it to be with us. She’s the definition of a hard-working Canadian. So help me help her, let’s show her how Canada gets down when someone fights this hard and needs our help.

If you are Canadian, or you understand what I mean, then this one is for you.

,Please help a Veteran having 4th hernia mesh surgery. Previous 3 have failed : (,"&#x200B;

[Go Fund Me](https://gf.me/u/wnndcp)

Hi everyone,

It's Christmas time and I know for most people this is the time of the year that people enjoy but for some reason Christmas has never been too kind to me. I am 33 years old and have been having problems with hernia mesh since I got out of the military when I was 22. I had a basic hernia surgery and the doctors put this mesh inside of me that has now been recalled by the federal government. Just this past week I found out that I have a nerve tumor in the site of my previous 3 surgeries which will require surgery to be removed and they tell me possibly fixed. I have zero faith in this procedure because I have 3 failures to make me have this reservation. I am absolutely broke. I haven't been able to work at all this year because of constant medical treatment and the bills have reached such a height that it's not even worth knowing the debt. Right now I'm more concerned about daily life like eating, bills, ect. I wanted to start a new life and that was my original Go Fund Me but right now I'm so screwed because I am practically homeless and have no car and just feel like I have nothing. My family is pretty much non existent and I just really beg and plead for a miracle. ANYTHING would help me through this situation right now. I really need help from somewhere and it just seems like religion forgot about me. I have had nothing constant pain and medical failures in my adult life. It's robbed me of happiness, my youth, and just anything resembling a quality of life. I joined the Air Force right out of high school and graduating early. I immediately ran into this health problem after I got out and do not have any veteran benefits despite having a honorable discharge. 

I know it's a difficult time of the year to be asking for charity but I really am someone that needs it right now. I am so close to giving up and someone helping me out could make a huge difference and give me some kind of belief that I can make it through. Please donate or share this. I am not special and not more deserving than some of the stories I've read on here but I am desperate and really in need of some kind of hope in life. My life has felt like a constant forest fire just trying to put out a tree at a time but not getting ahead. I really hope that maybe a miracle happens and I can get through this and have some kind of a family and career after this. PLEASE HELP ME and I will forever be grateful to you. 

Thank you and enjoy this holiday season."
,Supporting Kuntanawa Tribe in Amazon Rainforest!,"Olá !

My name is Myka and I am currently raising funds to follow my passion of giving my heart, time, and energy to the Kuntanawa Tribe. The leaders of the Kuntanawa Nation- Haru and Hayra have invited me to come serve their community beginning in February 2020. Effortlessly, these two have provided me with a sense of true belonging, and contributed to my health and wellbeing. The funds needed for multiple international flights, as well as proper survival gear for the forest adds up quickly! 

During my time here in the jungle, we are putting our efforts toward multiple projects that will support the sustainability and wellbeing of the tribe. This includes laying the foundation work to begin their hospital and language center, as well as forming the roots for a more sustainable agriculture and nutrition program.

With my Transpersonal Art Therapy background- I have  also been invited  to collaborate with a woman from the neighboring Huni Kuin tribe to exchange knowledge in pottery making. We will be installing a kiln so the Kuntanawa people have access to a medium that can provide them resources to create utilitarian work. (cups, bowls, plates, etc.) By providing the tools to create with pottery, this can also be a means to support them financially through trading their goods. I strongly believe in the act of creation as inheritenlty healing, and wish to support them in whatever form their artmaking unfolds.

With the fires that have been continuing to burn in the Amazon since January 2019 (Media coverage began in August ) the leaders of the Kuntanawa nation, Haru and Hayra have a lot more work to do to both in protecting their homeland and being a voice to the world about the current crisis of our rainforest, and how this affects the wellbeing of our changing climate. I wish to be of service to their greater goals.

I’ve attached a link to give you further information about Haru and Hayra, and the shared mission with their work.

https://ccc19.org/2019/02/22/peace-in-the-forest-the-way-of-the-kuntanawa/

If you have any funds to share or feel called to share my gofundme with others, this will help me to support a vision that is so much greater than myself. I strongly believe this is only the beginning of all of the potential changes that we are collectively collaborating for a world more aligned in love, service, and healing of our Mother Earth. Any donations greater than my goal will go directly to the tribe. I deeply appreciate you, in believing in me to make these goals a reality!

,Really could use a hand,"I have tried this GoFundMe thing once before, I didn’t get very far and as I have limited family and no actual friends or social media I have found it very hard to reach out to people and ask for help even as I hate doing so, I was always the one with my hand out to others mainly my family....now I just been stuck on the other end.

Fast version is in 2018 I lost two of my closest family members, my grandmother and uncle both from CHF I did all I could to help in every way, including financially which really put me in a bad spot but I don’t regret that. I had a job so bills were paid, credit was being stretched then I lost my job at the college I attended and my credit carried me some as well as some odds and ends jobs. Sold just about all I could on eBay to just float by hoping to get stable work but that has not been fruitful. 

My original GoFundMe was to help with bills and my debt, that has come and passed now getting lawsuits threats and endless calls. Winter is here really and the cold is setting in, I need to get  $500  fast which I’m hopeless to think I can get that in such a short time, trying not to lose heat and have my pipes freeze. Eh the link to my GoFundMe is here if anyone feels it is worth giving, I am not currently dying and see so many others in need it is just sad. I am so tired and stressed, I have thought of going to the borrow sub here but being honest I highly doubt someone would lend money to someone knowing that I could not pay back anytime soon if at all and I would clearly state that if I posted. I been scammed before and it is not a good feeling, more so when in need, so please no DM saying you have an opportunity for me just to try and take or use me, really can’t handle that stuff right now.

,Large Foodbank for Salt Donation,"Due to a screw-up at work, I have come into position of ~20,000 lb. of palatalized of food grade salt in 50 lb bags. I was thinking that a food bank or national food charity would be a more productive outlet than just sending it to the landfill. I called my local food banks, but they service mainly rural areas and don't have a use for 50 lb. bags of salt. Does anyone have any thoughts on a charity that may be interested? I plan on reaching out to the national office of one of the major food banks to see if they are interested, but if anyone has a better idea, please let me know."
,The most selfless person I know is close to losing everything. (Cross Post),"This is Ray. I met Ray nearly 4 years ago as a coworker driving a taxi cab. We filled slow nights talking on and off constantly. On a moment’s notice he lent me $200 so I could get my fiance our first puppy, two days before his rent was due, taking my word that I could pay him back after having only known me for a couple months.

That’s really just the kind of person Ray is. He’d do just about anything for anyone. I’ve seen him open his heart and his door not only to his family, but friends too, without hesitation. It didn’t take long before he became a dear family friend. A year later I asked him to be the best man at my wedding.

Driving a cab at night I was in a few potentially dangerous situations no one would ever want to be in. Ray was always a few blocks away or at least on the phone waiting to see if I needed help. I can’t count the amount of times he was willing to risk his life in my defense at a moment’s notice. As a vet that was nothing new to him. He’s about as selfless of a person as you’ll ever meet. 

A few years ago he moved into his childhood home with his sick aunt. He and his partner took care of her every need until the end when she passed last year. Unfortunately when she passed, the house was foreclosed on and  they have to rent the home he had one day hoped to own.

He now lives with his partner, his two kids, his sister, and 5 nieces and nephews. They have one vehicle between them, doing the best they can with what little they have. They’ve had to put off multiple house and car repairs for quite a while.

I’m making this for Ray and his family because I’ve seen him give so much to so many people in his life and it hurts me to see such a good person struggle. I feel like this is the best thing I can do for him right now and hope that the people reading this can see a fraction of the kind of man that he is. I want to see them be able to catch up and maybe not struggle for at least a couple months.

The money donated will go to home maintenance/ replacement (dryer, kitchen sink, bathroom sink, and water heater), car maintenance/ taxes, possibly a second vehicle in the distant future.

I’m happy to answer any questions. I just need visibility, even if anyone can just share this link on Facebook.

My emotional support cat needs surgery

[link to campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/grandpas-ms?utm_medium=copy_link&amp;amp;utm_source=customer&amp;amp;utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet) 

hi, I just helped my nan set up a go-fund-me and I couldn’t think of anywhere else to share it. 

My cats name is moose, he is my emotional support cat because i have severe anxiety and whenever i have panic attacks he is trained to calm me down, when i am in distress he knows to cuddle me and he tries to make me happy. 

yesterday my cat was attacked, presumably by one of the vicious dogs in our neighbourhood as i’ve been attacked by one too and have a scar on my thigh as a result. he broke his leg and we only have two options;

1. to have the leg amputated ($1500-$2000)
or
2. have it fixed surgically ($3500)

he means the world to me and i don’t know how i would handle it if we can’t get either surgery done, i would much rather prefer it fixed surgically but we are desperate for anything at this point. i am a teen who make minimum wage and my grandparents cannot work and are living off their retirement. we do not have any extra money. 
thank you for everything.

i have more information and in depth detail on the description of our go-fund-me.

,I have an inoperable pituitary tumor that is causing dangerous side effects. I'm in a bad bind and could use help treating the one thing we can address.,"[GoFundMe Link](https://www.gofundme.com/f/srs-funding-support)

I tried my best to explain everything in the Gofundme, but I'll also put sone information here. 

Hi folks, my name is Sophie, I'm 27 and live with my partner in the NYC area. I'm reaching out to you all today for help. I have a brain tumor growing on my pituitary gland that has been wreaking havoc on my body for the past year. We have been struggling through the process with several doctors and specialists and, because of the incredibly unique nature of my situation, are in a bad spot. They will not operate on the tumor because of its proximity to the rest of my brain and the fact that it is not yet cancerous. However, it is what they call an ""active tumor"" which means that it is actively creating problems via the manipulation of the pituitary gland itself.

 The symptoms it causes are complex, affecting my pineal gland, adrenal system, giving me horrible migraines, but perhaps the worst and most dangerous effect of this tumor is that it is somehow causing me to have *incredibly* high testosterone levels. We're talking about levels considered dangerous, exceeding the capacity of what the blood test for testosterone can even record. A normal limit for a healthy adult male for instance is around 900, my normal range was between 40-50. My current levels now range from 1200-1500+. This means I start falling into a category where the level of testosterone, over time, becomes a health concern, especially when considering I have two major heart issues already (bigeminy and mitral valve prolapse). 

Not only do these testosterone levels present a medical issue in that format, they also present another major issue for me as a transgender woman. I have been transitioned now for about 6 years, living fully as a woman socially, legally and everything in between. With my body now flooded with unbelievable amounts of testosterone I am seeing the results of 6 years of hormone replacement therapy and personal work go down the drain as I become more and more masculinized by the day. My voice will continue to deepen, I've never had facial hair before and now I have to shave and tweeze every day, the issues go on and on. Not even considering the dire medical concerns the testosterone presents, these issues alone are enough to drive me into despair. 

My specialty primary care, everyone he has consulted with, my specialty endocrinologist and even my cardiologist have all firmly recommended that removing the source of testosterone is the next step that needs to be taken as soon as I am able. The surgery to do so in the preferred manner is expensive ($18700) and will not be covered by my insurance. I have maxed out any and all options I have, I have no financial options available to me short of this. I've never had to ask for money in my life, always taking the greatest efforts I can to make things work for me and my partner, but now I have reached an insurmountable wall. **If you could take the time to even read or share this campaign it would mean the world to me and my family.**

,Running Out of Time; My First Surgery is on Dec. 19th,"[https://www.gofundme.com/f/helpthehoucks](https://www.gofundme.com/f/helpthehoucks) 

Hello there:  

My name is Sydney.  I'm a wife, and a mother, heading up a small family of four that cannot seem to escape the crisis in which we find ourselves.  

I have a treatable, but not curable genetic, auto-inflammatory condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa (Stage 3).  You can research it, but in simple terms, it's a condition that causes large, painful, non-healing abscesses and lesions across all parts of the body that house apocrine sweat glands (under arms, over thighs, genitals, buttocks, down legs, etc).  At Stage 3, tracts form under the skin, in thick, rope-like formations that travel between the abscesses.  

To say that this condition isn't a pleasure to live with would be the understatement of the century.  Every day is spent in a constant agony that I cannot begin to describe, and because of the extremely painful nature of H.S., I cannot work, or properly care for my young children, (ages 1 and 2).  

I am currently undergoing treatment that should, in time, render me more able to at least make myself useful around the house, and a better part of our children's care, and would also enable us to find adequate work.  That said, recovery and management is an incredibly long road ahead of us (estimated to be about 6-7 months in total for this treatment to be completed), and therefore, we need help to make ends meet with our healthcare and living expenses, which run around $1.500 per month.  

Up until now, we've been relying on my meager earnings as a 3D Animator (the only real work that I'm capable of doing, as it only requires me to use a computer from home), and assistance from family.  This situation is putting an incredible strain on those relationships, and we fear that by the time our situation finally straightens out, we will have damaged all associations we have beyond repair.  

We'd like our children to be able to grow up having those relationships intact, and thus, we are turning to fundraising as a last resort to help keep us afloat until we can find our way back out of the woods.   

We are perfectly happy to provide any and all documentation of our situation, our bills, and my condition should it be required for acquiring any sort of assistance we may receive.  

If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading our story, and thank you in advance for any help you may be able to provide, or even for sharing our story with your friends.  

Much Love,  
The Houck Family"

All donations, big and small, greatly appreciated:

""I never thought I would be in a position like this, but I need help.  I was the sole caregiver for my mother who was very sick for the past two years.  She had early onset dementia, heart failure,  severe diabetes, and was an amputee.  I worked as hard as I could to keep her at home so she would not have to live in a nursing facility, and she could wake up in her own bed and be in familiar surroundings.     


During this time my main job was eliminated by the company I had worked for after almost 14 years, and I ended up having to leave my second part time job to care for her full-time because we could not afford the 24 hour in-home nursing care she required.  Her Social Security and small pension were almost enough most months, but we fell behind on several things - the house included.  


We lost our battles in October and she went to be an angel with the Lord, taking her from the pain and confusion she suffered so horribly.  As her daughter, caregiver, best friend, partner, and companion for nearly 20 years, the loss was devastating to me.  And because I was not a spouse, I was unable to collect any further income once she passed so I am in danger of losing our house that we bought together in 1999.   


I have since obtained new employment but it won't start until January, and I was told the house will be put up for a Sheriff's sale at the beginning of the year.  I know she would be heartbroken if she knew the additional losses I am facing.  We also have rescue cats and I would have an incredibly hard time finding a place for us to live, causing me to rehome them which would break my heart all over again.  I need help to file a Chapter 13 so I can stop the pending sale and keep the cherished house she was so proud of.  I've lost my mom, and am in danger of losing everything else.  


My situation is desperate and I need assistance quickly. Anyone who can give even the smallest donation will have my overwhelming  and heartfelt gratitude."""

"" My daughter, Mikaylee,  suffers from Grade III Idiopathic Gastroperesis  and Dysautonomia.   Her stomach is completely paralyzed,  so anything  that she eats or drinks comes back up along with blood and bile.          She has been going for treatment at a motility specialist that is  125 miles away.  She has a Hickman Central Line,  a G-tube and a  J-tube.  The Hickman allows her to receive fluids and IV medications at  home.  Also, once a week her home health nurse gives her an antibody   treatment called an IVIG.  It is used to attempt to create an immune  system,  which she currently does not have.  She is extremely weak and  fragile. She has fractured both ankles and her wrist just by trying to  stand up or from falling and fainting. Sadly, she has hit the end of  what the motility center can do for her.         For the past 5½ years, her Internist and her GI Doctor have been wanting  her to go to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, FL, because symptoms and  her conditions are so severe.             Unfortunately we do not have the funds that are needed for  transportation,  lodging, and any other expenses that are necessary.        We also have been told to go to The Vanderbilt Autonomic  Dysfunction Center (ADC) in Nashville, TN, which is 320 miles away.   Again, we hit the same snags for expenses as we do for the Mayo Clinic.        Because we have to travel long distances often, my car is starting  to have trouble.  My transmission is going out.    This is my last resort to get help for my daughter.  She needs this to  give her the life she deserves.         I never thought I would ever have to make a GoFundMe, but as  embarrassed as I am for trying to get help, I have no choice.  If you  have some money to give, we could definitely use it.  If not,can you  please take a few second to share?  Thank you.

,Poorly Bladder Patient Campaigns To Raise A ‘Wee’ Bit Of Money For Charity After A Year of ER,"This is posted on behalf of my dear old friend Laura:

**Laura, aged 25, from England is trying to turn her difficult year of emergency hospital visits around by fundraising money for the Bladder Health UK charity.**

A few months ago, Laura or ‘L’ was forced to withdraw from her training as an NHS nursing assistant due to her failing bladder. She's had a really tough 2019 with the death of a grandad she helped care for, the ongoing pain of an undiagnosed bladder condition, and the stigma from having a tube coming out of her belly running into a bag of urine strapped around her leg.

Despite all this, L is determined not to let this bother her mission; trying her hardest to remain upbeat and positive for family and friends. She uses Instagram as a means to express herself creatively through photography, poetry & honest words; written to help others in the online community get a glimpse of what life is like living and coping with invisible illnesses - both physical & mental.

L politely declined the offer to accept crowdfunding for her own private treatment, insisting that nothing would brighten her Christmas more than being able to share her difficult 2019 story as a means to raise money for charity and encourage greater understanding of bladder illnesses and mental health in young women.

**Please help make L’s 2020 wish come true by raising £2020+ for Bladder Health UK.**

,My Best Friend Has a Rare Condition that has Resulted in a Tumour Growing and Crushing Her Organs. She Needs Help. Please Read," This is my best friend, Shauna.

Shauna has a rare genetic condition called **FAP APC gene defective (Familial Adenomatous Polyposis)**. This is 1 in a million condition that causes polyps to grow in the thousands. To prevent the polyps turning cancerous Shauna had to have her **entire large intestine removed** to form an **ileostomy** almost 2 years ago. This procedure in turn then led to a **J Pouch**.

Shauna's recovery was hard and long but she pushed through it. Around eight-month as Shauna has her ileostomy reversed, she got the news a **Desmoid tumour** was growing in her stomach wall. Desmoid tumours are fibrous tumours and a rare side effect of FAP which is an extremely rare form of cancer.

After discovering the tumour, the hospital decided Shauna should wait a further 3 months with no treatment to ""see what happens"". In those **three months the tumour grew to an inoperable size**, but still held hope! The next treatment plan for Shauna was chemo.

Due to the rarity of Shauna’s condition there is little known or understood around treatment, and there is no known cure. Shauna’s Medical team were as in the dark as us on the best course of treatment.  They started Shauna on two aggressive forms of Chemo.

Shauna underwent this chemo for 3 months. It didn't work, her **tumour actually grew**, and then a **second tumour appeared**. We could not believe it. She had been through so much for this not to work. As a final hope Shauna was put on a third, different form of chemo.

During this round of chemo Shauna really suffered the effects of her treatment. She was sick, tired, sore. As a result of this, she was hospitalised and her hair started to turn white. Throughout this treatment we were told that this was Shauna's final shot, if this did not work there would be nothing else they could do for her. 

When Shauna asked her specialist, what had happened to other people with her condition, her specialist informed her that they had all died. Our worst fears were coming to life. The specialist advised Shauna that if this treatment did not work she would have 6 months. 

Today Friday 29th of November 2019 we got the worst news possible. **Shauna's treatment has not worked. Her tumour has continued to grow.** As a family we have never been struck to the core more than we were in those moments hearing that news. 

What will happen is this tumour will grow and grow crushing and damaging Shauna's internal organs until she dies from it. **The hospital has given her 6 months**. We are deviated and distraught but won’t give up hope. 

We need your help to get Shauna access to alternative treatments. We will not give up without trying all we can. We will search and search until we find a doctor that will either remove these tumours or offer an alternative treatment. 

We need your help. We can’t do this alone. Shauna is the most wonderful, giving, loving, quirky and funny person and she deserves a chance. She is only 26 and a recent graduate. Despite everything she was going through she still graduated. She is superwoman. 

Shauna is at the stage in her life where she should be carefree exploring the world, setting out in her career, defining her future. It is too cruel to take this away from her.

I started attending college full-time and I’ve been living with my mother in a senior living community but need to find shelter elsewhere because she is having psychotic delusions and is being threatening and aggressive towards me.

Unfortunately, I don’t know anyone in Phoenix because I moved here because of health issues. 

I’m raising money to buy a used car which will allow me to get a job and also double as a home, so I can continue to attend community college or coding bootcamp and support myself. Still maintaining A’s and I have one B! 

I love learning Computer Programming and it’s my ticket to being able to support myself with all of my health issues(rheumatoid arthritis, cold urticaria, a fib) and make a decent living while doing something I really enjoy .

I’ve always been very good at helping other people but not very good at asking for help. Anything you could give($5 or $10) to help would be really appreciated. Thank you so much .

,Help getting away from abusive family.,">**Quick version**: Broke away from abusive family, scared of retaliation as they're vicious, ideal house came up for my disabilities right after, moving means freedom (also changing name) as they won't have address or be able to find us. Need £1k for deposit & moving fees, living on disability so barely have enough to eat, trying to save up by selling belongings too. Please help by messaging me or donating to gofundme. No scammers! You can't have my bank log in details. Someone already tried. 

&#x200B;

**Long Version**:

This feels awful to have to put up, but I'm absolutely desperate and very scared.

Without going into too much detail, I just broke away from my family, who are abusive narcissists and have used me as a verbal (and in the case of my brother, physical) punching bag. I'm 30, and yes I'm still ""under the thumb"". I have physical (and mental) health problems, which they have always been horrendous about - last year they forced me to ""help"" them out by letting my healthy brother sleep while I did his share of a task while sick with pneumonia. I almost died, wound up in hospital and then was yelled at by my father for not being available to help out again.

My father would often say that he was going to crash the car with me in it, on my 16th birthday told me he wished I had died as a baby (I almost did), and generally there has been a long string of reasons why this has gotten to the way it is now. Breaking away from a family of abusive narcissists is a really difficult process - my brother in particular is the vindictive kind, and I've spent the last couple of days waiting for the hammer to drop - they know where I live, and they will create problems for my family. We've already had my brother yelling at both me and my sister and attempting to gaslight us, and when that failed, it fell into silence. Anyone who knows my brother knows that silence is a BAD sign. It means he's gearing up to pull something especially nasty.

Putting it bluntly, I am absolutely terrified. I don't know what's about to happen, but something is.

Coincidentally, it's happened right before I was offered a house which takes me out of the county I am in and puts me next to a top hospital for my health conditions. It has a STEM school for my son, etc.. so it's feeling a lot like my lifeline right now. I had messaged casually about this house as it had no clear policy on payment upfront, and we've been looking to move due to my disability (stuck in a flat one floor up with another floor inside) - i'm a wheelchair user. I never expected to get this house, but it ticks all the necessary boxes and with the argument and the impending retaliation to us breaking free (me, my little sister, my carer and my 12yo son), it's become even more crucial that we move NOW as my big sister who helped me get away lives nowhere near so I have no other support. The new house is much closer to my big sister.

I am in the process of changing my whole name, my son's middle names and surname and my sister is also changing her surname. Moving right now would mean we would be free - they wouldn't have our names, they wouldn't have our address, and they wouldn't know where to look.

I need to raise £1,000 to make this a reality (this raises the rest of the deposit I haven't been able to yet and moving costs as I'm disabled and need to hire movers) - I'm not sitting on my laurels, here, don't worry. I'm selling my belongings and trying to sell plastic-free garlands for xmas trees made by my carer and my sister. It's really hard going as people (understandably) have a lot of outgoings for Christmas. I guess I'm just asking if anyone can help us get towards that goal.. please send me a message.

Also, please be kind. This is intensely hard to talk about, and I feel sick putting myself out here on display like this.. A lot of people don't understand how narcissist abuse can take you apart and destroy your life, I know that - I don't want sympathy for this, simply for people to understand that I have no choice and to help if they can. Thank you in advance, even if all you do is read.

,Gifting a Disney+ Subscription,"As the title suggests, my wife and I are helping out a family this year and would like to include a year subscription to Disney+ in the package we are sending them. Has anyone on here ever done this? We are not sure the best way to work this, there is currently no option for this available. 

Here's what i was thinking of doing:

\- Create a new email address (maybe something on the lines of ""Santa@gmaildotcom""

\- paying for said subscription for the year

\-including a ""coupon"" in the package with the email and password for Disney+

\-I would keep the email rights and different password, that way financial info etc is separate

One of my concerns is what kind of damage could they do to our account? Should we consider buying the sub. on a cash card so they cant rack up charges, if even possible? I was also considering about just opening up a new bank account specifically for these reasons, like a charity account we could use for future aid to give. 

TL;DR We want to gift an online subscription to Disney+ and unsure of the best way to do it"

I'm almost healed and about ready to get back to work. However, that money won't come soon enough.

I need to pay this months utilities, next months rent (due Jan. 1st), and part of next months utilities.

,A Family in Crisis; My First Surgery is on December 19th.," Hello there:    


My name is Sydney.  I'm a wife, and a mother, heading up a small family of four that cannot seem to escape the crisis in which we find ourselves.    


I have a treatable, but not curable genetic, auto-inflammatory condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa (Stage 3).  You can research it, but in simple terms, it's a condition that causes large, painful, non-healing abscesses and lesions across all parts of the body that house apocrine sweat glands (under arms, over thighs, genitals, buttocks, down legs, etc).  At Stage 3, tracts form under the skin, in thick, rope-like formations that travel between the abscesses.    


To say that this condition isn't a pleasure to live with would be the understatement of the century.  Every day is spent in a constant agony that I cannot begin to describe, and because of the extremely painful nature of H.S., I cannot work, or properly care for my young children, (ages 1 and 2).    


I am currently undergoing treatment that should, in time, render me more able to at least make myself useful around the house, and a better part of our children's care, and would also enable us to find adequate work.  That said, recovery and management is an incredibly long road ahead of us (estimated to be about 6-7 months in total for this treatment to be completed), and therefore, we need help to make ends meet with our healthcare and living expenses, which run around $1.500 per month.    


Up until now, we've been relying on my meager earnings as a 3D Animator (the only real work that I'm capable of doing, as it only requires me to use a computer from home), and assistance from family.  This situation is putting an incredible strain on those relationships, and we fear that by the time our situation finally straightens out, we will have damaged all associations we have beyond repair.    


We'd like our children to be able to grow up having those relationships intact, and thus, we are turning to fundraising as a last resort to help keep us afloat until we can find our way back out of the woods.     


We are perfectly happy to provide any and all documentation of our situation, our bills, and my condition should it be required for acquiring any sort of assistance we may receive.    


If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading our story, and thank you in advance for any help you may be able to provide, or even for sharing our story with your friends.    


Much Love,

,"Please Help Me Stay in Georgia Tech, Thank You!","Dear All,

First of all, I sincerely appreciate your time and clicking on this page.

[My GoFundMe Page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-my-way-to-the-most-deadly-hacker)

Let's talk a little about me. I'm a master student in Georgia Tech, one of the top public universities. I started coding since 13 years old because I was shit in video game and thought how about building my own server and cheats. Unfortunately life got in my way that my parents decided to put their money in starting a new business and I have done quite bad in my college entrance exam, consider it's a Chinese SAT. I couldn't choose my favorite major - computer science and I lost my America dream for a long period.

Last year I decided to discuss to my family about studying in the states because even in public universities, cost is high for my family. With my parents approval, I tried my best to work on my application and luckily I have accepted by Georgia Tech.

The deal was my family pay for my first year's tuition and living expense and I'll try my best to get a position like TA (teaching assistant) or RA (research assistant) so that I can get paid and have tuition waiver. I'm still unsure about how Georgia Tech select TAs although I have already submitted my application. I have asked couple professors about TA but was told that they're not responsible for selecting TAs.

As cybersecurity enthusiastic, I found myself doing research is enjoyable and probably an easier way to get GRA and tuition waiver as applying TA has too much uncertainty. Luckily prof. Brendan D. Saltaformaggio, one of the best professor in malware analysis, accepted me to his lab - CyFI lab. However next semester - spring 2020 I can't have any funds as I have to prove to him I have the ability to work for him, considering its an intern but no payment.

But once again challenge comes in and it really got me. Last month I received a phone call from my father which was strange because he never called me in his morning. He told me he planned to have a divorce with my mom because he has affair and also asked how was my progress in applying RA/TA. I was if that is what my dad wants he can just follow his heart and do whatever he wants because he's a grown man. But when I talked to my mom I realized the thing is more than I can comprehend. My dad already had a son with the lady (or should I call her bitch) and he's been maxing out his credit card and family savings for his lover and my come-out-of-no-where brother (or bastard). My mom is so upset and has been sick for two weeks. And as you can imagine she can't afford my tuition anymore. I have talked to my dad and the respond was 'I don't have money. You go get loan or something.' The moment I heard the word I was so shocked and I can't believe because my dad becomes totally a person I don't know. He was the man I shared movies with, I went jogging with. He was the man who saved my ass when I hacked my undergrad's website and almost get arrested. I'm quite hopeless now as I lost my family and the only income source. As F1 student it's illegal to work as bartender or to serve in the restaurant, and plus studying in Georgia Tech is so challenging that I barely have extra time not even for a movie or party. What's worse I'm alone in this country that I can't find any co-signer to apply for loans and I'm not eligible for federal financial aid.

What's even worse, I put myself in a bad situation although I think it's worthy. I'm from mainland China but since I was in middle school I read a lot about Chinese history and I started using proxy and VPN to look for truth and real news at the time. And that's why I was so eager to leave the country at the first place at high school. I have been 'secretly' supporting Hong Kong protest and voicing for Tiananmen Massacre also Xinjiang Uyghurs on social media as their human rights are violated so badly and Hong Kongers' courage reminds me of those value that Americans are proud off. But some of my high school classmates found my instagram page, thanks to its friend suggestion algorithm, and got so pissed off and accused me a traitor of the country. Besides they have reported me to the authority as my speech is considered a crime in China - 'Inciting subversion of state power'. My parents are threatened and my bank accounts are suspended couple days ago. My father is a police officer and he asked me to stop and delete all my post because if the communist party can't come to me they will come to him and have him lost his job. Basically even if my parents have money they can't transfer to me unless they buy bitcoin. And if I return to China I might ended up in jail and disappear.

I'm here seeking for help that keeps me in the states and continue my dream instead of ending up in jail in China. The amount is for spring 2020 and potentially fall 2021's tuition if I still can't get any funds.

How am I gonna use the money: I'll pay for spring 2020's tuition first and use part of the money for living cost like 5000-6000 ish. As you can see from my I-20 tuition and fees for year is 30478+3199=33677. I'll use 16838$ to pay for spring 2020 and 5k-6k for living cost. Next, from May to July I'll be working as intern and probably can save 5k ish in two months. If I can get GRA for fall 2020 I'll donate all the remaining donations I get from here to people in GoFundMe seeking for educational support just like me.

I've come this far and I won't easily quit as I know how good I'll become and how much I can do for this country and for those value and truth I have been pursuing and fighting for. The freedom in the United States which I can support what I believe in and learn what I want is so precious that I never take it as granted because I'm from a place where liberty is never existed. And I don't want to give it up. My major is not only my passion but also the cutting edge way to defend our freedom.

Sincerely with my greatest gratitude, Chow"

,Need help paying my son’s medical bills.,"After starting his life in the NICU we found out he has a seizure disorder. A week at CHOP and endless specialist visits have left us scrounging to pay medical bills.

On May 25th of 2018 our first child Jameson was born three weeks early and spent most of his first week of life in the NICU. Less than two weeks later he began having seizures. We took him to Virtua in Voorhees New Jersey where they immediately sent him by ambulance to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. 

Jameson stayed at CHOP for a week, with me and mother by his side every minute. After a week and medication Jameson’s seizures had stopped, however we never found the cause of them.

In the past year we have had to bring him to CHOP and other specialists for checkups and testing as they hope to find a cause for his seizures. Thankfully Jameson has been seizure free for over a year! He’s a beautiful healthy one year old now.

However, the bills for his hospital stays and checkups/testing are piling up and we are really struggling now. I work two other part time jobs to try to make ends meet, and we have both sold almost every personal item of value we owned.[GoFundMe Page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-with-baby-jamesons-medical-bills?utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&rcid=8ef32a40ac484aa08847fed16e5b8651)"
,"Need a little help, please.","My son and daughter share a room. The other night my daughter had a friend sleep over. She slept in my son's bed and my son slept on the couch. A few days later, we find out that the girl that slept over has lice. I inspected the beds and swore I saw eggs but I wasn't 100% sure. Anyway, I panicked....bad. I threw all of their bedding out, vacuumed the mattresses and floor. I put all stuffed animals in the dryer on high for over an hour.

I was planning on going today to get them new sheets and comforters. But, alas, the old ""when it rains it pours"" showed it's ugly head and another, more important matter came up. The children are sleeping with couch pillows and thin throw blankets. They are in need of a sheet and comforter. I can afford the pillows for them.

It's embarrassing to ask but, can anyone help with this? I don't expect one person to buy both of course and even a twin sheet is appreciated. Nothing even has to match. I'm not picky. I just want my children warm and comfortable. Thank you for reading this. I hope it makes sense as im upset right now that I even need to do this. Feel free to ask me anything."
,Please help my friend with unexpected medical bills,"Hello everyone, my friend Charlie needs your support in these trying times. He's been saving for years to get top surgery, and after countless ups and downs, the operation was finally on track to happen. Unfortunately, despite already paying for the surgery, the hospital neglected to tell him that they would be charging him separately for a staggering $1101. He needs to get this together by December 12th, and having just paid an exuberant amount for the operation itself, he needs help. For that, friends all across the internet, we turn to you.

,Miracle Survivor,"Several weeks ago my father was in a 5 car accident on the freeway. He was in the middle and completely smushed but luckily did not die. He broke his back and has ligament damage to his spine. He went through back and spinal surgery which put steel plates on each side of his spine as well as rods throughout his back. He is self employed and cannot return back to his profession. Via doctors orders if he lifts anything above a certain weight he can be paralyzed. This has completely turned he and my moms world upside down, as they have lost one whole income and partial of another. (Partial meaning my moms as she has had to take time off work to take care of him which passes her sick and personal leave) He has physical and occupational therapy multiple times a week and wears a brace over his entire front and back to keep his spine and back in tact. Doctors, surgeons, and nurses have all claimed it’s a miracle he survived. They need all the donations they can get to help them with their bills as this has greatly affected them each and their livelihood. We so appreciate all the prayers, well wishes, and help that you can offer! This has truly been a humbling and life changing experience for all of us. Thank you so much.

Long and short of it is that my father lost his job and he was the main breadwinner.  While he searched for work I was the only one bringing any money in with my meager freelance art/writing jobs. But it's not enough to pay all of our bills and on top of all of this my laptop died. The motherboard fried and replacing it would cost a wild amount.

Now it has been over a month and my dad is still no closer to finding work and we're down to practically NO money. We have no way to pay bills since my source of work died. We're in a very very scary place and need help badly!

Could you please PLEASE help us get some groceries and maybe pay to keep our power on so we don't freeze over the winter? We all would vastly appreciate it! Thank you!

,A fundraiser by my Friend on her Birthday!,"It is the most special day of the year for her. On her birthday this year, she started a fundraiser for No Kids Hungry mission. This mission means a lot to her. I am hoping that you’ll consider celebrating her birthday with her. Every little bit of help from you will help her towards her goal. 

No Kids Hungry works to ensure that every child in the US and Abroad has healthy access to the healthy food where they live, where they learn and where they play. Each $1 donated can provide upto $10 to hungry kids.

,I'm a trans woman in need of legal representation,"## New Title: I got in trouble with the law, and I'm fucked without representation I can't afford.

### Original Post:

My name is Ellie, I am a transgender woman living in North Carolina. In  February of 2019 I had a friend over for drinks. She was underage, and at one point I went to the restroom and she downed half a bottle of vodka.  She has a complicated medical history, and she asked me to call an  ambulance.

I was given a ticket for providing alcohol to a  minor. When my court date came, I showed up, pleaded guilty, and was  sentenced to 5 hours of community service. I was also told I would need  to take a $40 class, and appear in court at the end of July.

Due to lack of transportation and funds, I failed to appear in court, and I am now in need of a lawyer.

&#x200B;

[I've created a GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-ellie-get-a-lawyer?utm\_source=customer&utm\_medium=copy\_link&utm\_campaign=p\_cp+share-sheet)

Edit: due to the fact that I seem to get comments saying the same thing, I wanted to address a few things: 

For one, I am entirely aware that I put my self in this situation. I fucked up. I know I fucked up. Please don't leave a comment saying I fucked up. I'm not under any illusions about whose at fault here. That being said, I'm here because I need help, and if you have some sympathy, then feel free to aid me. Otherwise, no harm done and no hard feelings. Hell, check the GoFundMe, I have a single $20 donation from a friend of a friend, and that is all. I have friends, they haven't bothered to help either, not because they don't give a shit, but either because the can't, or because they have the attitude that I've made my bed and need to lie in it. If you as a stranger don't give a shit, or just share the sentiment, that's okay. 

Please stop telling me my transness is irrelevant. I left a comment somewhere down below talking about this. It affects how I'm being treated by the justice system, and it affects the severity of the consequences imposed on me. Now, that being said. I think one of the reasons I keep getting comments of this nature is because of the title of the post, and in retrospect that's a very valid criticism. It's borderline misleading, and I didn't realise it at the time, a better title would be ""I got in trouble with the law, and I'm fucked without representation I can't afford."" The body of the post could remain more or less the same. 

Anyway, that is all, continue to enjoy your life."
,Hats for the Homeless,"I've been knitting caps (toques, toboggans, whatever you choose to call them) for several years now, mostly to be given to homeless people. I used to be welcomed at shelters, but starting last year the larger shelters have started turning me away. I'm still managing to give away what I knit, but need more places in eastern Tennessee that will accept these donations. Any thoughts are welcome."
,Giving Tuesday - Growing Hope Farm for Special Needs Adults,"[Growing Hope Farm](https://www.gofundme.com/f/growing-hope-farm-fund?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet) is a place where people are different, not less. A  place for all those with individual needs to call their own. Growing  Hope Farm raises cows, goats, chickens, and turkeys. On the farm we also  grow tomatoes, onions, basil, and other vegetables. We then turn this  food into salsa, tomato sauce, applesauce from our apple trees, and  more. We're creating a self-sustaining community for those who need it  the most. After high school many people with special needs lose   resources imperative to a healthy, productive life such as relevant  life-skill experience and job coaching. Growing Hope Farm creates real  opportunities for people to learn and grow, not just a place for people  to be.   


Growing Hope Farm is a non-profit organization that takes  ZERO government assistance. That means we rely 100% on donations,  fundraising events, and the sales of our products and meats. EVERY  donation counts. Big or small, each and every person that contributes is  pushing us further along. Growing Hope has many challenging financial  obstacles moving forward. These include but are not limited to,  


1) A large barn for goats, cattle, cats, and our two dogs.  


2) Fencing supplies for perimeter of the property.  


3) Housing for full-time residents, and two small staff buildings for caretakers.   


Of  course, all of these projects far exceed the $10,000 goal of this  fundraiser. But even a small stone can send out long-reaching ripples,  and every tiny bit closer we get to our goal of a safe, happy, and  positive environment for our loved ones is a good day for us.

,Help bringing the Holidays to Veterans this Christmas Season,"We are an organization out of Chicago called Do Good Inc. The name is fresh, but our philanthropic corp has been doing things together now for 7 years. We are made up of young adults, police officers, firefighters, veterans, moms & dads out to make the world a little better through acts of kindness. We do this through a lot of volunteering and hosting a couple of drives through the year to help folks out. Our main one at this time of year is Presents for Heroes. What we do is collect items, all donated by individuals and businesses to fill large flat rate boxes with. Items like toiletries, washcloths, soft blankets, shirts, socks, gloves, hats, puzzle books, decks of cards, dice, coffee mugs/tumblers, notebooks, pens, pencils etc. We then spend 12 hours 2 Saturdays before Christmas packing the boxes and wrapping them in wrapping paper and store them at the Hines VA here just outside Chicago. The following week, our volunteers hit every bed at Hines, & Jessie Brown VA. Any extra boxes our volunteers offer to bring to satellite VA facilities to be handed out by staff on Christmas Day. The boxes are always appreciated, but they also act as a olive branch for any Veteran that wants to talk to someone to have that chance and it not feel forced.

If this is something anyone would like to donate to, we have a google sheet with items and counts of what we need along with links to some of the best deals. In years past, we’ve even had folks from overseas purchase and have items shipped to us. We prefer items that way anyone donating can know we’re not out there to take money, we want you to see the end result of the items you gift begging received. We are partnered with Hines VA for this event and have the appropriate 501c3 documentation as well. If you should have any questions, please feel free to reach out to my contact at Hines, he will vouch for the legitimacy of the event. Silvestre Cahue 708-202-2940. Just ask him if the Presents for Heroes event is legitimate and let him give you the answer. Thanks much!

,Campaign to give back to the Homeless this holiday season!,"I have this wonderfully amazing and supportive friend who is giving back to the underprivileged to help them get through a rough NYC winter. We are both college students who live in NYC, and we see homeless people on the streets just about everyday. We always talk about making the world a better place, but it's time to take some action. Last year we ran a similar GoFundMe in which we raised enough money to make 100 winter 'care packages', but this time we're stepping up the scale and aiming for 500!! Our expenses are as followed:

BAGS= $530   
HYGIENE KITS= $604  
WATER BOTTLES= $52  
SOCKS= $264 (480 pairs)   
UNDERWEAR= $500  
THERMAL SURVIVAL BLANKETS= $400  
GLOVES= $480  
SNACKS=$200 (granola bars)  
FRUITS= $250

TOGETHER we can put together small packages with essentials to help those in need and potentially save lives. ANY contributions will be appreciated not only by us, but by those who are spending their holidays on the streets. I can provide my email, phone number, or instagram to anyone who contributes, and will update you on our progress. We'll take any help we can get, so if you live in NYC and are interested in volunteering to help put together the care packages, or help distribute them, feel free to reach out to me. Thank you all so much, and I hope everyone has magical holidays.

,Wings For Life World Run (May 3 2020),"RUN FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T!

*100% of entry fees goes to spinal cord research*

The Wings for Life World Run is different. It’s not what you may be used to from other races. First of all, the start signal will show up all over the globe at the same time. Exactly at 11am UTC. That means in London the participants start at 12pm, in Munich at 1pm, in Japan at 8pm, and so on...

There is no finish line. There are Catcher Cars. They start their chase 30 minutes after the start signal, passing one participant after another. Relaxed runners, for example, will be passed at kilometer 5, while professional runners will be sweating it out until kilometer 60. Do you have a goal in mind? The [Goal Calculator](https://www.wingsforlifeworldrun.com/en/goal-calculator) will help you figure out the pace you’ll need to set. Your result will not be a time, but rather the distance you have achieved.

At Victory Ridge Academy of Lake Wales, Florida, we serve over 270 **students with special needs** (with a waiting list) from both Polk and Highlands counties.

For the past several years Victory Ridge Academy has partnered with Polk County School Board to provide student transportation. Due to circumstances beyond our control, beginning in August 2020, PCSB will no longer be transporting VRA students.

Through Victory Ridge Charitable Fund’s Wheels on the Bus Campaign, our goal is to raise $800,000 to acquire 8 school buses beginning in the 2020-21 school year.

Without this funding, two-thirds of our students **may no longer be able to attend our school** to receive the specialized education and therapy that they need.

Please consider donating to VRCF’s Wheels on the Bus Campaign. This is the largest fundraiser that our charitable fund has ever undertaken and it is critical to the future of our school.

 The Children’s Museum in West Hartford, Connecticut offers hands-on fun with science and nature for younger children and families, school and community groups, and home schooled children. Our programs bring STEAM based, hands on education to those that might not otherwise have access to it. We focus on under served communities, schools with little to no funding, and community centers where families can learn together and take that learning back to their homes.  

&#x200B;

We currently house some 300 unwanted and injured animals, and will rescue, rehabilitate, and release over 600 this year alone. All animals are used as educational ambassadors to help children and their families learn to be stewards of the environment and make the world a better place for the present and future. 

&#x200B;

At the Museum and in classrooms and communities throughout New England, we encourage children to become creative thinkers and lifelong learners. Children engage in our interactive labs, workshops, multi-sensory exhibits and demonstrations, a live wildlife sanctuary, state-of-the art digital science dome planetarium shows and movies, vacation camps, sleepovers, birthday parties, scout activities, and special events. Our unique Children’s Museum Preschool, co-located on our West Hartford campus, integrates science experiences into early childhood learning. Nearby Roaring Brook Nature Center in Canton offers environmental exhibits, nature programs, concerts and acres of outdoor hiking, bird watching, and winter cross-country skiing. 

Any and all donations are welcome and appreciated. Thank you!

,Help a Disabled Trans Woman Escape Debt,"The GoFundMe page has the full explanation of the situation, but I will copy paste it here as well 

 [https://www.gofundme.com/f/disabled-trans-woman-needs-to-clear-debts](https://www.gofundme.com/f/disabled-trans-woman-needs-to-clear-debts) 

 Hello, my name is Katie Walker, and I'm in DESPERATE need for help. Some background: I'm a Disabled Czech Trans Woman, who was unable to finish University which extremely limits my ability to find employment and to stay employed. In July of 2018, due to a dumb decision, I got into debt. At the time, it wasn't a problem, as I had a well paying job and could pay the monthly payments without issue. Said debt grew as I began making survival decisions, which grew by a huge chunk in February of 2019. Due to my declining health, I kept spending more and more time on sick leave away from work (hooray Czech Sick Leave Law), until in June of 2019 I messed up the paperwork for it. This resulted in me being fired at the start of July of 2019.  
   
At that point, I had managed to find employment, and was set to start working July 10th of 2019. Said employment was working at a game store. Unfortunately, corporate decided to close the location and move employees over to the new one that was opening up nearby, resulting in me not being brought over. July 15th 2019, I registered as unemployed with the unemployment office, and have been looking for a job since. The unemployment office however only covers five months of unemployment, and as such will not cover me after December 14th 2019. Due to my status of being visibly trans and disabled and fat, without any skills as my previous experience was working call centers, nobody is hiring me. The Czech Republic has an anti-discrimination law that covers being trans, meaning firing me for being trans is something I could fight in court. However, if they declare that they ""chose a better candidate"", I have no solid ground to stand on.  
   
And this is where I'm at. As I write this, it is November 28th, 2019, I turn 23 on the 29th, I got three more job rejections and two weeks left. Considering the time frame, I seriously doubt anyone will hire me, and despite my mother's comment, I am fairly certain the government doesn't consider me disabled enough to deserve monetary support. I only have one way out of this. A Plan. With your support, I could pay off my debt all at once and move to France, to live with my partners Félicie and JoJo, Félicie being the one to make this campaign, as I'm unable to make GoFundMe Campaigns as a Czech citizen. This would mean I wouldn't have to pay rent, I wouldn't have to cover the debt or bills, and I could contribute to the household with the patreon support I currently obtain for my writing. I do not have the vocabulary to properly express how dire the situation is, how important this is for me, and how much you'd help me, and especially not how grateful I'd be to clear this mess out."

,My friend needs physical therapy but can't afford it.,"Hi, a friend of mine has recently had an accident which left her unable to walk and with crippling pain. Her copay covered most of the treatment, but not physical therapy which she needs to be able to go back home and live a normal life. It costs her $172 USD a day. She's poor and can't afford it. She's just out of reach of the AHCCCS program (something like 14 dollars above poverty).

,Help me and my girlfriend reunite after more than 2 years! I hope Reddit can do it's magic and give us a hand!,"Hi guys, my name is Daniel. I'm a Venezuelan student who had to leave his country due to the crisis happening there right now. I live in Spain at this moment.

I had to leave behind a lot of people that I really love, one of them being my girlfriend. Since I'm here, I've been working super hard and trying to continue my studies, but the money I earn isn't enough. That's why I opened the campaign, since the money I win barely allows me to live through the month, I haven't been able to plan any reunion with my GF, and I would really love to give her a surprise next year and invite her here, to visit me some weeks.

I would really appreciate if you could donate something. All that money would be used to cost all the expenses of the plane flight and the money she needs to bring here to Spain ir order to be allowed in. Which in total is around 2000 euros.

If you can't donate, then please share my campaign, it would help me a lot!

Thank you very much!

,Raising money to keep our stay at an extended stay hotel,"My family and I have been battling homelessness since spring this year and we have been having a really hard time breaking the cycle of destitution. We are honestly raising funds to keep our room at an extended stay hotel for up to a month while we look for a new apartment. A small family and another stranger were so gracious and generous enough to pay 2 nights for my family on Thanksgiving day and as we have been completely overwhelmed by their kindness; the days that were paid for did not go to waste and we spent those 2 days working some quick jobs that helped us pay for another 2 nights!

If there is anyone that can spare any amount to help us, it would be tremendously helpful and it will mean absolutely everything to us.

Thank you so much for your attention!

I cannot afford my bipolar medication (Lamictal and Prozac), my anxiety medication(Clonazapam), or my endometriosis medication (Orilissa). I cannot even afford to eat; I am allergic to gluten because I have celiac disease. I get bad periods due to my Endometriosis and cannot afford feminine hygiene products or OTC medication for the pain. I currently am on my period and have a cold. I do not have any clean clothes because I cannot afford to use the laundromat. I get SOME help from the government but not nearly enough. I have to constantly ask people for money—who can’t help so that is why I am making this. I don’t have a car, cannot afford to save for an apartment. I am basically homeless.

,Trying to recover from unknown illness and fraud.,"Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. The current situation I am in is because of my physical condition. I experience pain in my stomach, my left lung, and my lower back. The last time I went to the doctor, I was treated for h-pylori and given two-weeks of heavy antibiotics. The medication initially worked but eventually increased my stomach pains. I went to the clinic last week and the doctor said everything seemed normal, though I was suffering from dizziness and nausea. This pain has been progressing for months, and recently, I have been dealing with chest and back pain. It has started to put a heavy toll on my life since I am not able to work regularly. Though it is difficult to keep up with the pace of life, I understand that my current situation does not excuse any inaction.

I’m currently in a financial bind after being scammed of my life savings online. My bank is unwilling to compensate me because I am considered liable. I had gone to my local police, and even asked for the help of a hacker, but to no avail.

I am not someone who enjoys sitting around without being able to provide for myself. It has taken me so long to reach out to the online community for help. I understand that to some, $4000 is not a lot of money, but it is all that I had. If you can find it in your heart to give anything, appreciate it.

Additionally, I understand that a lot of people are not comfortable giving a stranger money. I would also appreciate food or books. I had to sell most of my electronics, school books, kitchen supplies, and most things of value to pay back my bank and survive. I am not giving up! I'm trying to find work so that I can get back on my feet as soon as possible. However, I am worried I will not be able to make it past this month. Since I have run out of things to sell, I am also struggling to afford food. 

I would be so grateful for any form of help, not just with money, but with food or even conversation. I am only eating one meal a day in order to save money for rent. I would appreciate it if you could only give words of encouragement! I am very much down on my luck, and even just a small amount of help makes a world of difference.

&#x200B;

I have come to realize that Brandon started me on my journey to become an active protector of children.  


I met Brandon during his fight with leukemia. I was blessed to know him. Sitting down to write this was the first time I had taken time to share my feelings on how Brandon touched my life.  


I worked with Brandon’s mother, Tracy, a few days each week. Tracy would bring Brandon into work and while he was there, he was as curious as any young boy looking for fun. I’d catch him peeking in my office or throwing some projectile toward me while laughing hysterically. I realized almost immediately something different about Brandon. He had a strength and hope that you could see in his eyes. It was nearly impossible to be sad around him. He was going through this fight, yet he was strong, confident and so caring about others before himself.  


I found myself excited for the days when Tracy would bring Brandon to work or when she would say it was okay to visit him in the hospital. My business was relatively new at this point and I always had something going on, but I found myself working extra hard just to make time to spend with Brandon.  


Since I'm a kid at heart, I felt I had to entertain Brandon and have some fun when he would come in. I remember working hard to complete my tasks so that when Tracy and Brandon would come to work, I would be able to spend time with him. We would draw, watch movies, play games, go to Dave and Busters and laugh a lot. Watching Brandon go through his battle did two things to me. First, it helped me understand how nasty and aggressive cancer and the treatment can be on someone. Second, I now look back and see that I learned to be more selfless because of him.  


When Brandon and I first met, I was only two years into being a father to my eldest son, James, and knew nothing about parenting — let alone childhood leukemia. What I did know was a parent’s unwavering love for their child. After marrying Amy, I never imagined that I would be able to love anyone more, but love for a child is different. God created a miracle that contains a piece of each man and woman.  


On May 7, 2009, at the age of 9, Brandon lost his battle with leukemia. It is so difficult for me to see a child suffer, which is why the J19 Foundation exists today.  


Today, more than 10 years later, the J19 Foundation has helped children like Amanda in Denver, CO, Israel in Egg Harbor, NJ, Tommy in Warminster, PA and Peter in Grand Rapids, MI. I think you get the point: We help children — just like YOUR child, grandchild, niece or nephew — anywhere, at anytime.  


This [\#GivingTuesday](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/givingtuesday?epa=HASHTAG), I'm raising money for J19 Foundation. Your contribution will make an impact, whether you donate $5 or $500. Every little bit helps. And on GivingTuesday, Dec. 3, Facebook will match the first $7 million in donations to causes all over the world, so time is of the essence. Thank you for your support. I've included information about J19 Foundation below.  


J19 Foundation is a non-profit organization (501(c)3) whose mission is to assist families with children who have been diagnosed with cancer. We help with financial needs due to hardship, provide charitable resources to assist families with maintaining life standards and ministering to families to share the word of God for eternal life.  


By the way, Brandon's birthday would have been two days ago on November 27th.  


In honor of Brandon, I need to ask that you would consider donating your time or money to help support our mission.

,Performing Arts Non Profit Needs Help,"Hi, My daughter has been dancing ballet at this [ballet school](https://tacomaupac.org/t-u-p-a-c) since it opened three years ago. They provide high quality dance and performing arts education to kids who may not typically have access to this type of opportunity. Because of this, almost every kid was on financial scholarship during the first year. The director was paying for almost everything out of her retirement savings. In the last year, there has been a big increase in paying students but the ballet school is struggling due to a lack of funding. They are putting on a show this weekend called the Urban Nutcracker. My daughter performed in it last year and it was mind blowing to see such a diverse group of performers on the stage. 

The ballet school is working on getting grants but because they lack funding, they haven't had the team that they need to dedicate to focus solely on gaining capital and operational funds. I'm worried that the director will use her whole retirement on keeping the ballet school afloat and the teachers need to be paid in order to keep them showing up for our kids each week. I'm worried that the kids in our community who need this ballet school to take classes might lose out due to lack of funding.

My daughter is one of the kids on financial scholarship and because of her training, she has had lots of amazing performance opportunities in the last year. She was even cast in her first play at a professional theater. From taking ballet, her confidence, discipline and focus has grown so much. If it closes, my daughter and a large number of the kids there wont be able to just go to another ballet school. Please donate to this [501c3 charity](https://tacomaupac.org/shop?olsPage=products&page=1) (There on links on the page to donate in different increments). If you have questions, I can tell you more about the ballet school, what they do for the kids, and the opportunities they have been provided."

,"I have a rare chronic illness, that keeps me bedridden most everyday, am NEAR homeless and I can use your help with charity, sharing or even advice!","Hi there,

so as I said above. I have something called Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. For a long time I thought it was just chronic fatigue syndrome, but this one is really nasty. I get fatigued I get brain fog, I have all sorts of nasty little side effects that by themselves might not be that big of a deal but when you add them all together it is disastrous and ensures that most of the days of my life are filled with suffering. ""The crazies"" themselves have been brutally hard in my lifetime, especially when for decades it was just chalked up to this psychiatric disorder or that.

For a long time I was being misdiagnosed and mistreated by at the doctors (even dangerously and terribly so), but recently over the last year I found a doctor who has been fantastic and now finally, we are zeroing in on what it is, which means that at least I can have a chance to start treating the illness. No, it's never going to go away, however there is a possibility that I can be treated, but even that right now is going to be trial and error, since we are just zeroing in in a proper diagnosis.

Meanwhile, because I'm in bed for up to two-thirds of my waking day, that is after I have already went to sleep for a good eight to nine to 10 hours, and then have brain fog and fatigue after that which I still have to rest to get rid of if I'm lucky (thank God for meditation) I have been relying on gig economy jobs like uber, Lyft, instacart, Postmates, etc. Unfortunately, right now my ability to do that has become limited, and some of those gigs have fallen through for one reason or another.

So here it is, it's Thanksgiving tomorrow, my rent is almost due, Christmas is right around the corner, and I have almost no money and VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY limited ways to get any.

A while ago, I started to think about starting a fundraiser, so I kind of threw one together hastily, not knowing what I'm doing, not knowing where to share, my friends and family are mostly tapped Out. I have already begged and borrowed just to stay afloat. So now I'm in the situation where I have a fundraiser, but I don't know how to make it attractive, how to get people to notice it, and I don't know how to get it into the hands of people who may be willing to at least give if they are in a situation of abundance. I do not want from people who don't have enough, I would only like it if people who did have enough who are charitable and would like to help.

Luckily I think by today's standards my rent is not that expensive and my car payments are also not that expensive, but without a car and without an apartment it's going to be very difficult. I have considered maybe going to a shelter, but because of my symptoms, that would be near impossible. It would only take a few days of me in the wrong environment to turn into a quivering mass of sleeplessness and suffering.

What I need is a little bit of a break. But there are jobs that I can do, but right now it's going to take time for me to find them, and also if I have a little bit of a breathing space to rest for maybe two or three months, and focus on the healing plan that my doctor and I have been discussing, and maybe some other research that I have been doing online as well about natural solutions, I feel that life would be a lot better for me. I would have time to get a job more geared toward my talents, something that's part time, something that I can work with, and maybe in the process start really healing.

So what I am asking for, from anybody who decides to read this and is interested, if you can give that's great, if not I completely understand. If you can share that would be awesome as well! I will put the link to my GoFundMe below. Sharing is caring to coin the cliche phrase 😁. The share with anyone you care to and if you have places that you think sharing will benefit greatly, share there too!

Maybe most importantly is if anybody has advice on where they can share this or where I could share this or how I can make this more appealing or attractive, or really any advice at all on how to run a successful GoFundMe campaign asking for contributions for things like having a medical illness and needing rent help temporarily and all that, that would be fantastic.

Below I will post two links. One to the symptoms of my illness, and two, to my GoFundMe which I have created. Any and all help is super appreciated. Happy holidays!

Please and thank you in advance!

,"My wife’s cousin is dying of leukemia. We’re hoping to raise enough money so he can afford painkillers and regular doctor visits, just so he finds some peace before he dies.","I spelled out the story in detail [in the GoFundMe we set up,](https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-shuvro-cancer-fund?utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&rcid=043af509850748f785f18b861aa92657) but the gist of it is this:

My wife’s mother died and we went to Bangladesh (where she’s from and where her mother was living) to handle her affairs. During the trip I had a chance to meet her cousin (they are very close, though, so she always calls him her bother). When I got the story out of her (she wasn’t too happy facing his death as well so close to her mother’s) I found out that his wife and parents sold everything they own and emptied their accounts to get him treatment. That was almost a year ago and since there is no health insurance, and they can’t pay up front, his family has to watch him die basically.  As I mentioned, they can’t afford proper painkillers and as I understand it he spends a lot of his nights screaming from the pain. 

We’re putting together what we can manage but it won’t be enough. So now we’re hoping the kindness of strangers may be enough to help him find some peace before the end. We’re hoping for $2,500 which is enough for him to afford some basic care during whatever time he has left. 

Thank you everyone for taking the time to read. [Here is a photo we took while we were there](https://imgur.com/KzmAvFf) of him and his son if that helps."

,"Earthquakes in Albania have left many people homeless and left in the rain with nothing, including my friend’s family","“A 6.4 MAG Earthquake hit our hometown of Durrës, Albania where my cousins, aunts, uncles and grandma live. Everything in our homes have been destroyed. My aunt was trapped in her home and was later able to be rescued. Food is scares and there is no resources. The ground has cracks that go 20 miles deep. No one can come in or leave the cities unless it’s medical personnel or search and rescue. My family was able to bring the mattresses out and have been outside for 25 hours. It has rained and they are drenched with no extra clothing. The children, all below the ages of 14 are cold, traumatized and hungry. Two family friends in our neighborhood have passed away during the tragedy just a few houses down from ours. We only have limited amount of wood left which will not last the entire week. I want to raise $3000 which is $1000 for each family - my two uncles who have 3 kids each and my aunt who also has 3 kids. This would provide blankets, water, and food until this catastrophe is over. Aftershocks are expected to hit very hard throughout the week. My grandmother has heart problems and isn’t able to get the medical attention needed. She is very fragile and is relying on her heart medication. Please find it in your heart to help as little or as much as you can. I never expected such a catastrophe to hit my family.”

,Looking for a little help - Towering Inferno of Vet Bills,"So, last year I had a bit of a breakdown.  I had to take time off work.  My mom helped me tremendously.  I'm much better now and catching up.  However, because of me, my mom's fallen behind on her vet bills.  Her dog, Sophie, has a lot of ongoing issues.  She has a condition where she can't produce her own tears and a skin condition due to an allergy to fleas.  Recently she's had an eye infection that cost her some of her sight and a fungal infection.  She is a country song of issues.  I want to help her because she's help me.  Unfortunately I can't magic it away so I made a GoFundMe for said dog.  Anything would be appreciative.

[Sophie in better days](https://i.imgur.com/gRP8vVl.jpg) \- This was taken a year ago (I think?). This was about the beginning of her skin condition.  You can see the bare skin on her legs.  It took a long time to figure out what it was.

,Help Out My Dude!,"This is the Story of My Dude. On my way to work, on November 25th, I witness what I believe was a car intentionally attempting to hit a cat. I pulled over and the cat was still alive and I wad unsure how bad she (at the presumed a he) was. 

So I took off my hoodie wrapped it around this cat in the middle of the road, almost getting clipped myself by another car and ran back to my Jeep.  I drove her over to a Vet Office that just recently had opened, the whole time saying things like:

""Don't worry my dude, I'm going to get you some help. "" and ""Hey don't you die on me My Dude, we are almost there!"" And ""I got you My Dude, you're safe now.""

All while calling my boss and telling him I was going to be late to work and I'd take the PTO time if needed. 

I dropped her off at the Vet explained what I'd seen and the nurses took her back. I called two hours later to check on her, find out she was Microchiped and they were attempting to reach the owner and that she would require a surgery, I ask to keep me updated. Also that it's a She and not a he and her name is Bree.

Two hours later, I call back again. They say she's sedated but doing fine, still waiting to hear back from the owner. That she should have the surgery that afternoon. 

Two more hours I call back again, told she's fine, still hurting, but medicated and they are still waiting for contact back from the owner. 

Two hours later, I am in the area and swing by to check on her. I'm told that her owner is surrendering her to the vet because he can't afford treatment. They are going to put My Dude down. 

At this point, I assume Financial Responsibility for My Dude. They agree to work with me and that they will be in touch. 

I stop by again after work, My Dude is up and despite having the worst day of her life, immediately gets up and Nuzzles my hand. 

I talk to her Doctor, they have brought the Surgery bill down dramatically, touched by my dedication to saving this cat.  She has head trauma and her jaw is fractured and needs to be wired back together. 

I've never asked for donations for something like this and even if no one gives me a penny I'll make sure My Dude is good and taken care of. But if you can help me save My Dude, I'd appreciate it. The vets have discounted the first surgery dramatically:


And have agreed to remove the wire for free once she's healed.

My Dude is out of Surgery! I was told she was a Champ (Of course she was, she's My Dude!). She's a little high right now, but the surgery went great! They are going to keep her for a bit still, too monitor her and see how she's handles things. Thank you everyone for your support! My Dude appreciates you!

Update #2:
Update: So in had called and checked a couple times throughout the day but I've been swamped with work and not able to post. After work we (Aly and Myself) went to visit My Dude and met one of her benefactors there, I'm not going to name them for the sake of their privacy. We're visited My Dude in their comfort room and she's doing good. She's a bit tired and obviously wasn't in super playful mood with her cone on. We spent some time with her, giving her love and letting her stretch her legs. The nurse let me know she's eating well, the surgery looks like it went great,  all the X-Rays came back good. And now some, My Dude [Pictures](http://imgur.com/gallery/qasMUpb)

We spent a good moment in their comfort room with My Dude tonight, she stretched her legs and finally settled in to for a nap on Aly and me.

On Monday October 28th, 2019, 3 year old Aicha departed this earth due to unknown causes. It has been as much of a shock for the family as it seems to you. Aicha was an absolute light, joy and a true angel to all those who she encountered. You couldn't get her to walk down the street without her stopping to say ""hello"" to all of her neighbors.

,Severely disabled man will be homeless soon,"[Listen to his story here](https://youtu.be/aHqaWULJjCY). Bill has been struggling with a debilitating medical condition for over six years. He has fought hard to survive, but his funds are now depleted. He will be homeless in less than 5 weeks unless help is given quickly.

Bill has been given the generic diagnosis of fibromyalgia and CFS/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue) but is one of the worst cases ever observed as far as symptoms and capability goes. It makes it nearly impossible for him to care for himself. He experiences chronic muscle pain across his entire body and frequently lapses into a coma-like state for days at a time. He is too weak to leave his house on his own, even for doctor appointments. He needs more medical tests to discover the underlying issues.

Your donation will help Bill keep from being homeless as well as allow him to, once again, receive medical tests that he so desperately needs to diagnose his condition. Without help, Bill will lose everything he has left and with his inability to move without assistance, he may face a terrible fate.

Please give what you can, but also share this story with your friends, family, co-workers, church groups, all your social networks, and strongly encourage your friends to do the same. This needs to spread as far as possible to have any chance of saving Bill. Thank you.

,Help for Tenille," 

Tenille is one of the most giving and selfless people I have ever met. I'm proud to call her my girlfriend, my forever, and one day my wife. Right now she is going through a most difficult time. I know she has difficulty asking for help on her own, so this is why I have started this GoFundMe page for her. It's just a shame that her choice to trust people resulted in her losing her home.   


After surviving domestic abuse and being homeless for almost two years she found a landlord that understood her situation and said she could move herself and her two boys into a home. When the furnace became broken, however, the landlord showed his true colors and forced her to move out. He flat out refused to fix the furnace, even after the city told him that he had to. Didn't care that he was putting a single mother and her sons out in the cold. And the Minnesota winters are notorious for their frigid temperatures.   


The landlord told Tenille he was a contractor. Imagine her surprise when she was taken to court and the JUDGE told her ""Contractor? Not sure why you thought that, that man is a respected attorney in this court...."" It was at this point she knew she couldn't win. It's always this way, it seems at times. Another blow to the underdog. So her family is couch surfing while she tries to find another place for herself and her sons, one of which is still in high school. Understandibly, she just wants her family back.   


Any monetary amount will help, but she is looking for any assistance available to her. She has met with different agencies seeking a solution. She has been to shelters, but with the weather being what it is there's even a waiting list for those. Throughout all of this turmoil, she still finds the good in people and it's just absolutely amazing to me. If you can find it in your heart to provide her any assistance in this matter, I would likely feel the same about you. Thank you and God Bless you in advance.

,"[Request] Trying to improve my health - need new shoes, exercise mat","(also posted on other help-related subreddits) 

Hi, everyone. I'm trying to improve my health and need some help getting some equipment to start an exercise routine at home. I have PCOS and my doctor wants me to be more active to help manage my symptoms. She's right, of course - not only is my free time generally spent being sedentary, but I had to take a work-from-home job when I moved cities because I couldn't find work in my new city. That means I'm sitting down almost all day, and that's not good for my health. I put a summary of my health timeline at the bottom in case you need some context for this situation. I'm happy to answer questions if you have any.

Basically, it would mean the world to me if I could get some help getting a new pair of shoes or a workout mat or resistance bands that I can use to start an exercise routine. I work from home and could spend my regular breaks walking around the block if I had supportive shoes, or I could do stretches and chair exercises with resistance bands. If someone is feeling extremely generous, an under-desk cycle or elliptical would help me get a LOT more exercise during my workday, as I could use that literally all day.

I also don't have anything except some shoe inserts to help treat my plantar fasciitis, and having some additional things could help me better treat it. Like a night brace, supportive shoes, a foot rocker, supportive slippers so I can stop wearing tennis shoes in the house, etc.

# TL;DR: I don't have enough spare cash to buy some basic workout equipment and supportive shoes that would help me start being active again to improve my health.

Literally any help you can offer would be so, so appreciated. My priority is to get **supportive shoes** and a **workout mat**, as those are more versatile and financially feasible, but having an **under-desk cycle or elliptical** is the one thing that I would splurge on if I could so that I could be more active all day when working at my desk.

**Amazon Wishlist for Exercise Stuff:** [**https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/TFIFM5V4ET0I?ref\_=wl\_share**](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/TFIFM5V4ET0I?ref_=wl_share)

Here's kind of a summary of my past and where I'm at right now:

* I was always a very active person. Tennis, dance team, regular walks. Waited tables full-time during college. Hiking trips for my biology major requirements. I was always in motion and it felt great.
* When I graduated from undergrad, I moved to a new city with my husband. We moved everything ourselves, into and out of the moving truck, and I caused a lot of damage to my right foot due to unsupportive shoes. I literally couldn't walk without a shoe insert, and even then it was pretty painful.
* My doctor said it was plantar fasciitis and said I needed to wear supportive shoes at all times except in bed. It took two years to get my foot back to ""normal"" where I could put normal weight on it without shoes on.
* During those two years, my activity level plummeted and never recovered. I was out of shape after two years of limited activity and then I started graduate school while still working full time. I felt so exhausted all the time that exercising was the last thing on my mind.
* I was diagnosed with PCOS around that time, and my doctor said exercising regularly can help address the insulin resistance and other symptoms. I was able to get at least some exercise in almost every day for a couple of years by taking the dogs to the dog park, walking around the mall, zumba, and using the city's community centers for exercise machines.
* In the past three years, I was less able to be active due to changing jobs, supporting my husband in getting his PhD, and progressing in my own graduate program. My PCOS symptoms have gotten much worse and I've gained over 70 pounds in the past few years.
* Losing weight with PCOS is very difficult, but exercising is the most recommended way to try addressing it. Exercise also helps address another symptom: insulin resistance. I am terrified that I'll develop diabetes as a result of insulin resistance, as I'm already at risk of developing diabetes because three of my four grandparents also had diabetes (and I suspect both my parents have undiagnosed diabetes). Exercise can help me try to prevent that for myself.
* We recently moved again, and again loaded and unloaded the moving truck ourselves (we can't afford to hire movers). I regret to say that my shoes probably needed to be replaced, so weren't very supportive, but we depleted our savings to pay for moving costs and I didn't feel we could afford to buy me new shoes at the time. So again, my right foot is causing me extreme pain and I can't even walk without wearing my tennis shoes at all times. Yeah, the old ones that I still haven't been able to replace.
* When I moved to this city, I had to take a pay cut when I took a work-from-home job with the same employer I had in my old city. I wasn't able to get a job here in my new city. So not only have we depleted our savings during the move, but we really don't have extra money to spend beyond rent, bills, student loans, and food.
* I feel like I need to make a change to be active again or risk further decline in my health. I want to feel better, be healthier, treat my PCOS, and try to prevent diabetes.

Any help that you're willing to provide would be super appreciated. Feel free to ask questions if you have any. <3"

,Fundraising for Semper K9 - A charity that helps wounded veterans with service dogs,"My name is Anthony Davis and next year, I will be running in the 45th annual Marine Corps Marathon, and I will need your help.  I will be running for and raising funds with Team Semper K9.  Semper K9 is a veteran owned and operated nonprofit that provides custom trained service dogs for wounded veterans. Using rescued and donated dogs, Semper K9 provides service dogs for psychiatric and mobility challenges free of charge to wounded service members.

As a veteran (Combat medic Army's 10th Mountain Division) it pains me to see these men and women...my brothers and sisters sent to fight unnecessary wars, needlessly putting their lives on the line, and helping those who need assistance, only to come back home and see their voices ignored when they need help. 

So it will be a great honor to lace up my shoes and run with team Semper K9 and support them in their mission to make the lives of wounded vets and their families easier

This is not an endeavor I can do alone, I need your help. If you know a veteran, love a veteran, or are a veteran yourself, I ask that you support me by donating any amount and/or sharing this post and my [fundraising link](https://donate.semperk9.org/fundraiser/2510796) with others

,No income since having my baby and just need to get through a few more weeks,"I had my daughter 10/21 and I've been off work since then. My husband is disabled and can't work (we are trying to get him on disability support) and I didn't have any short term disability pay through my job so we have been stuck with no income. We are a family of 5- myself, my husband, my 14 year old stepson, my 4 year old son, and new daughter. 

We set up a gofundme to try and help keep rent and bills paid until I can earn a paycheck again. I am back at work tomorrow but I won't see any pay until a few weeks out and we need to pay rent and at least the phone bill by next week. We also need gas and groceries. Any help is appreciated!

,Need help with buying a new laptop for school,"I need some assistance with purchasing a new laptop. Recently, water was accidentally spilled onto my laptop for school and won't turn on anymore. I took it to the Microsoft store to get it serviced and they told me that my warranty didn't cover water damage nor would they attempt to fix it because it doesn't seem fixable. My only option since then is to buy a new laptop and retrieve the data from the old one. Because I am currently an undergrad student at a university, I already spent most of my money on tuition and have very limited work hours and student loans already. I still would need a new laptop for next semester and hope to use the holiday discounts to buy one. I am only asking for help with money for the laptop and I will personally pay for the data retrieval and a new warranty. Therefore, if you could assist me, I had created a [gofundme](https://www.gofundme.com/f/c8yksv-college-student-needs-new-laptop) .

,Best and Worst Charities for Your Donations,"https://www.consumerreports.org/charities/best-charities-for-your-donations/

""Tips for Giving
• Verify tax-exempt status. If you’re not sure whether donations to a particular charity are tax-deductible (don’t assume they are), confirm a group’s status by checking with the group or by searching on the IRS website. 

• Give directly. If you’re contacted by a professional fundraiser for a charity you want to support, hang up and give directly instead. “The fundraiser might be keeping two-thirds of the money,” says Stephanie Kalivas of CharityWatch. 

• Watch for fees. Online giving platforms and crowdfunding websites often charge payment processing fees on donations, perhaps 3 percent or more, which reduces the impact of your gift. The charity may also be charged transaction fees if you send your payment via credit card. To avoid those fees, consider giving by cash or check or direct bank transfer when possible.

• Request privacy. If you don’t want to be bothered by endless fundraising appeals, tell groups you support that you don’t want your name and contact information sold, exchanged, or rented to other groups or for-profit companies, a common practice among some charities. You also can ask the groups not to send you further appeal letters, email, or phone solicitations. Check the charity’s privacy policy before giving.

• Be on guard for soundalikes. Some low-rated charities have names that resemble those of high-rated ones. For example, there’s the low-rated United Breast Cancer Foundation of Huntington, N.Y., and the high-rated Breast Cancer Research Foundation of New York City. “In some cases, soundalike charities are there with the intent to deceive donors into thinking they are donating to somebody else,” says Bennett Weiner of the BBB Wise Giving Alliance. In other instances, groups have similar names because they’re focusing on the same causes.

• Consider donating to the charity watchdogs. They’re charities, too.""

,I'm trying to do something for the students in Hong Kong,"Last Sunday, PolyU was surrounded by HKPF and after seeing how bad it was, I want to help the students. Earlier this week, I read that Taiwan Universities are opening their doors for HK students to sit in their classrooms. They would have to pay a registration fee of 20 USD and a dormitory fee which is around 250 to 500 USD. I'd like to help them pay the fees or, if we raise a lot of money, anything related to their education (tuition, supplies, etc). 

[I setup a gofundme page this morning.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-students-of-hong-kong) I'm struggling with the logistics of it all. I need help understanding where to send this money once it's raised. Should I email the Taiwan universities directly? I've contacted one already and waiting to hear back. Or is there some organization there that can send the money where it needs to go? It would be a pain to contact each one directly and find out how many HK students went there but I'll do whatever I have to do.

,Crippling chronic illnesses have left me desperate,"Hello, my name is Elena. I am currently a stay at home Mom of a 6 year old boy. Long story short, Back in January of ‘19 I woke up with 3 small bumps on my left hand. 2 doctors and a specialist later and I was diagnosed with Mild Palmoplantar Pustular Psoriasis. I was still working and everything was going alright. Come August I was diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis and Fibromyalgia. I was in so much pain I was no longer able to work and relied on my significant others moderate income. Through all of this we’ve been managing. My rheumatologist started me on a medication that accelerated my psoriasis to one of the most severe unique cases that my dermatologist has ever seen. The skin of my feet began to come off in thick sheets exposing my raw last layer beneath. I could and can barely walk. My feet have to remain bandaged 24/7. And I am for the most part bedridden and rely on my significant other for care.   The rest of my body has become covered in raw scabs from my head to my toes. Then I developed a staph infection. I’m starting a new medication that has promise but even after that I am looking at at least a year for recovery. My significant other is working his tail to the bone trying to keep up with the bills. But, we’ve gotten to the point where we can’t keep up anymore. I am waiting on SSDI to come through but that could take months. We are behind on our rent, our bills are piling up, and I’m creating this go fund me as a last ditch effort. We appreciate any and everything that anyone is able to donate to help.

,Redditors. My friend is about to lose her house. Can anyone help?,"My friend lives an incredibly meager life. She and her mother used to share a single wide trailer until they were able to put a down payment on a shed that my friend was able to turn into her own little house. They don't have any amenities that we all are so used to. No indoor plumbing, no electricity, no running water. 

Today she woke up to repo men trying to take her home because her mother stopped making payments. I know there's a situation going on there that I don't feel comfortable sharing on their behalf, but know that this isn't a permanent situation for them.

,"Friend's six-year-old needs feeding therapy, insurance doesn't think eating solid food is medically necessary.","[https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-savannah-hensler](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-savannah-hensler)

My best friend's little girl, Savannah, is a walking, talking, sassy miracle who loves space and animals and wants to go to Saturn for her birthday. She was born with something called Heterotaxy Syndrome. Basically, most of her organs are in the wrong place, malformed, or just missing (if she's hiding a spleen in there they've not found it). She was born with nine heart defects and had two open-heart surgeries by the time she was two and has been on a pacemaker since then because she has no native heart rhythm that is compatible with life. Her parents were told she had less than a 5% chance to make it five. Today she turned six.

As you can imagine, her life is a whirlwind of medical treatments, medications, home adaptations, and therapies. One of the major issues that affect her and her family's day to day life is difficulty eating solid foods. Because she spent so much time intubated as an infant/toddler her motor skills, in general, are way behind and she never developed the skills needed to feed herself, chew food, move food around in her mouth, drink liquids from a cup, drink from a normal straw (she has special ones with some kind of valve that helps), or even swallow her food without choking. She also spent a lot of time afraid of putting things in her mouth, likely as a result of trauma from being intubated, and even offering her food would cause her to panic and vomit. So, there is a lot going on there.

Insurance covered feeding therapy for a bit, after a long and drawn-out fight. Savannah's parents were still covering all the items needed for therapy, the adaptive tools she needed to eat/drink, and the gas to drive an hour each way to the clinic. Now, insurance has once again decided that eating and swallowing are not medically necessary and have cut off coverage for the therapy and have removed the ability of Savannah's dad's company to override the denial at the company level (which is how they got the therapy covered before). Current Savannah gets most of her nutrition from an ultra-pureed blend her mom makes and freezes in pouches. It is a multi-day process that has to be repeated every few weeks. If Savannah cannot continue making progress she will have to eventually go on prescription formula and, most likely, a feeding tube. It is much easier and healthier, not to mention better for her to be able to function as a whole person, if she can learn to eat on her own and get her nutrition like everyone else. It would also take one major thing off her mom's plate, and allow her to get some time back for all the other things she does as Savannah's primary caretaker.

We would appreciate any help you could provide. The family is appealing through insurance and trying some other avenues, but even if that does end up working it will still take time and they have to pay out of pocket in the meantime for the appointments on top of all the other expenses that go along with it. If you aren't able to contribute, please consider sharing. Any contribution helps relieve the stress this issue has caused this family.

Thank you."

My problem is I have no idea where to donate it?   
There are lots of clothes donation boxes around, but they all say that those are for protecting the environment from clothing waste. Or giving jobs to the people that work for the non-profit.

He became mobile again by riding his bicycle. Unfortunately, at 73 yrs of age, he did take a fall while riding which seemed to leave no effect. He had no bumps or bruising. Slowly he began showing the effects of a brain bleed which we mistook for the effects of the recently diagnosed dementia. The was eventually able to recover form the brain surgery needed to drain the blood, only to be later diagnosed with prostate cancer . My father being the resilient man that he is went through targeted radiation treatments and is now cancer free.  What we need is  help for him and my mother.  Some home care and safety equipment to make the home safer. They are retired and help with the bills would help immensely.

,Is there a charity organization for people with terminal illness or similar conditions to get laid?,"Most states outlaw prostitution. But I was thinking of how there is that bunny ranch in Nevada and I started thinking of how many people have cancer or MS, etc. I really started thinking of how many people are unfortunate to not have a friend like the comedian Jim Jeffries (he has a bit on how he drove a friend who was ill to get laid).

I am thinking I want to donate to an Org or if one does not exist, maybe I can participate in helping create one.

I'd image this task would be very difficult. For the legality of having to transport a cancer patient from a state/region where prostitution is illegal to another, the cost of the actual act, the medical pre-screening for STDs, having medical professionals to assist in whatever care is needed.

Is there an Org that exists that helps people in this way? If not, how would one go about creating a non-profit purely for the legal, sexual-needs of individuals that are not able to have a normal dating relationship due to a severe medical illness?

This has been on my mind for quite some time. I would really appreciate at least understanding what attempts others have made or are in the process of making in a legal way.

,University of Iowa Dance Marathon Donation,"Hello there,

I am dancing for my universities branch of Dance Marathon this February. I am looking to raise $500 for the kiddos I am dancing for! Here is some info on the organization: 

Dance Marathon is a student-run philanthropy dedicated to supporting oncology patients being treated at The University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital. It is a year-round organization that culminates with a 24 hour long BIG Event in February. To date, Dance Marathon has raised over $21.5 million dollars for children being treated for cancer.

,Please Help Support Victoria While She Recovers From Surgery,"Thank you for taking the time to read about me!

My name is Victoria. I have a very difficult time asking for help, but I’ve exhausted my options at this point. I need help.

Two months ago, I developed Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) in my right knee, which is a joint disease characterized by inflammation and overgrowth of the joint lining, becoming benign tumors. It can also produce extra fluid causing the knee to swell, making it difficult and painful to move. This can only be removed surgically, although it has a high occurrence rate. It develops randomly with no connection to genetics.

I had a successful operation done on November 13th and I’m currently taking time off work due to doctors orders. Of course, its going to take time before the pain mitigates, I can move around without crutches, and be on my feet for longer than a few minutes. I am instructed to rest until December 13th. Fortunately, I was approved for time off of work while still maintaining my job as a barista. Unfortunately, I was only approved for 40 hours of paid time off. This financially covers about a week of the time off I have to take to recover. This means I would have to return to work on the 25th of November to make rent, bills, and feed myself. I’ve estimated I’ll miss out on $1500 combined in hourly wages and tips for the remaining three weeks. I will use the funds to pay for what I normally would if I were working. First, rent so I won’t lose my home while trying to recover, my bills/payments, and groceries.

,Raising Money for the Animal Rescue League of Boston,"I am currently a Junior college student taking a course on social change. As part of the course, we were assigned to do a project on trying to create change in our community. My group and I decided to address the issue of neglected animals. This is an issue dear to me specifically because I have adopted a cat from my local shelter. Based on my experience, it is evident that many shelters need more resources and funding. 

We have named ourselves the Yellow Hat Foundation based on the kid's tv show, Curious George. The Man in the Yellow Hat took in Curious George and took care of him when he can have easily abandoned a wild animal. We hope to embody this spirit of helping animals in need. Hence, the yellow hat reference. 

We are in the process of trying to raise awareness of the cause and that has included things such as making an IG page and an official flyer. 

However, our main goal right now is trying to raise money for the Animal Rescue League of Boston. With more funding, the ARL will be able to provide more free clinics to help animals and shelters around the community.

,Humanitarian Trip to Mexico,"Hello everyone! In March 2020, I will be traveling to San Quitin, Baja California, México to build a home for a single mother. The program is sponsored by Student Reach, an organization dedicated to helping and empowering women and children through humanitarian efforts. They have already begun building a community through a strict vetting process for these women and we want to help better their lives, one home at a time. 

Offering a helping hand has been on my heart for over 15 years and the opportunity has finally presented itself to act on it.  This also falls during my step-daughter's spring break and the plan is to surprise her on her 12th birthday with her passport. She and I have talked about the needs of others and I know she'll truly cherish this experience. Your contribution will help cover airfare, lodging, meals, and, most importantly, building costs.  We're a family of 6 and we want to show that even though the world can be a bad place, there is still some good left out there. 

The trip will begin on March 8, 2020 and I will be returning on March 14, 2020. There will be approximately 20 of us going. And yes, we will build a home in under a week. 

More information on Student Reach can be found [here.](https://www.studentreach.org/trips)

,"Help the Blind and Vision Impaired by Donating to VisionCorps Annual Fundraising Event, The Eye Drop! Please Help my Team Reach Our Goal!","VisionCorps formed shortly after the First World War to help blind Americans self sustain after suffering wounds during battle that left them without eyesight. Since the 1920’s the nonprofit has grown into one of the oldest and largest non-profit organizations in Pennsylvania. They focus on employing people who are blind and vision impaired in manufacturing, food processing, and administrative services. The organization currently employs more than 150 individuals, 75 percent of whom are blind or vision impaired. VisionCorps serves more than 2,000 individuals through rehabilitation services, in addition to screening more than 8,000 children a year for vision loss, and providing rehabilitation and Youth Services to provide the tools and training to empower these individuals to attain independence. VisionCorps also facilitates access to free vision exams and basic frames and lenses for low-income families.

VisionCorps is not a government funded organization, so they need help from people like you so they may keep supporting the blind and vision impaired! This years’ fundraising event is the “Eye Drop”, held this November 22nd. The goal of the event is to raise $151,000 dollars through charitable donations, as more than 90 volunteers rappel 125 feet from the top of the Holiday Inn in down town Lancaster, Pa.

,"Help needed to keep full custody of my 5 year old son, Finn; filed PFA on his behalf against his mother for the emotional/physical abuse she has put him through. Judge granted me the PFA and court date is the 21st - I can’t afford the retainer unless I sell my car.","Last Tuesday, November 5th, when I went to get my son, Finn, from school, I was informed by the caregiver that his mother had just picked him up just 30 seconds before I arrived. Confused, I called/texted but got no response. I went to her house (the school is .014 miles from her house) to see if they were there but was told by her boyfriend that he did not know where she was, that she never answers his calls either and that if I didn’t get off the porch he would physically assault me. I waited off the property for hours paralyzed by worry. I did not know where he was or if he was safe. 

She finally texted me “I am angry with you so I am not answering the phone - I am going to my parent’s house”.  Despite asking where her parent’s lived, offering to meet her wherever no questions asked, she abruptly stopped responding to my texts and not once answered my calls. I had no choice but to go home after 10:30pm and wait to see if he would be dropped off to school.

The next day, I called the school and was told he was dropped off in the morning. I almost collapsed. I began then to talk to my local DA’s office, lawyers and the school district about what happened and what my next steps were. When I went to pick him up from school and to talk to the principle, he ran to me and gave me such a tight embrace; the first words he said were “I saw you on the camera last night when you came over”. He related his experience of the previous night: when I came to the door and rang the doorbell, his mother took him upstairs and told him to be quiet. He tried to cry out so I could hear him but was restrained and told that he could not come downstairs until “dad wasn’t on the camera anymore”. He had to watch me, his dad, who had dropped him off that morning, come to the door to get him moments after he was unexpectedly picked up by his mother and was rendered helpless. He had to hear her boyfriend threaten his father with physical violence simply for trying to pick him up on his time.

He related that his mom and her boyfriend were fighting, threatening to “stab each other if they take the kids away”. He was “really glad they didn’t stab each other”. I was devastated. He had told me they fought before but I naïvely never pressed on the context of the fights. I was wrong for not pressing sooner.

I met with a lawyer that night who drafted a few documents for me and told me to file a protection from abuse on my sons behalf. I filed the PFA on Thursday of last week and was granted it by a judge. My lawyer is asking for a $2,500 retainer to represent me at the hearing on the 21st. 

I do not have this money. I already have represented myself once when we got divorced 4 years ago; I lost the house, my possessions but I did get what mattered most to me - joint legal custody and a 50/50 schedule. I realize now that I should have gone for full custody but I had no support to help me achieve that.

My son is adamant that he doesn’t want to go back to that house. He thinks he will turn into “a bad person if I stay because they fight all the time and when I grow up I’ll fight all the time too”. 

She was served last Thursday at 5:15pm by the sheriff. Since then, she has cancelled his aftercare (to hurt my ability to work), her boyfriend has texted me (where is Finn, he wants to see his real dad) and to top it all off, she has not reached out to the Layne Project for the 2 hours of weekly supervised visitation she has been granted by the judge. I call the project director everyday (7 days so far) to check and see if she has set up a time yet to see him and as of writing this, she has not. How she could not make that a priority is beyond me.

He has been so happy with the consistency I have provided him since that awful Tuesday last week. He deserves to be happy and all I want is for him to learn, love and laugh. I truly want her to get into therapy and for all of us to move forward in the best way possible. I want my son to also talk to a therapist about all of this as well - I know there is more he isn’t telling me (and I am not in a position to ask right now - I want to keep his mind off of the abuse). 

My court date is the 21st of November. Less than one week away. I am having anxiety attacks sitting here wondering how I can pay a lawyer to represent me and help me prove my case. I know if I go in there alone I will be emotionally unable to make my case. I know I will be paralyzed. I was married to her and we were together for five years - I feel like I developed PTSD from what she put me through. 

So before I sell my $3,000 car as my final solution, I figured I would try, for then first time in my life, to ask others for help. I can’t do this all by myself. I need a car but he needs to be safe and that’s my priority. 

Any help is appreciated. I just want to give him what he deserves - a good environment, a good role model and consistency. I will continue to do everything I can to facilitate that.

,CANADA - Possible to start a Charity fund?,"CANADA - A Random idea, that has been thought of before I'm sure... Looking for ideas/comments on starting a Charity Fund where by the interest earned is what gets donated. Raise 1 Million Dollars and you have approx. 50-60k a year of giving to charities every year without the need for extra charity donations. 1.8 times the initial donation is used for charity every 30 years.   
My Idea would be that the financials of the fund would be public obviously and each year donors to the fund would have a chance to vote on the charities to be given money.   
Or instead of funding charities, the fund could be used as direct supports to people in our city or province (keep it local?). With publications and social media to showcase the good the fund is doing directly, not just donations to a charity where you do not see the DIRECT impact of the dollars raised.  
Just an idea for now so don't crucify me. Comments would be appreciated.."

This is the only indoor skatepark in the whole county with the nearest other like for like indoor park being over an hours drive away.  It's an essential facility for the youth (and not so youthful) of our city and county that will be greatly missed if it is forced to close in the next few months.  I am a rider at the park, as is my 6 year old son who would be devastated if the park were to close.  He is progressing so much with his scooter riding at the moment due to the park and us being able to visit 2-3 times a week.  Without the park, we will have to travel much further for similar facilities and it's going to be a struggle for myself and most other users of the park to be able to fund the regular travel.

,Medical bills have pilled up from an accident last year in April and I need a lawyer and gas to get someone to drive me.,"Long story short, last year on April 1st I aspirated into both lungs but the right one more so from two un-diagnosed ulcers in my stomach and spent a week on life support, another 2 weeks in the hospital, then was transferred to rehab and stayed there a day. I have been disabled since birth with low end spectrum Cerebral Palsy. I thought it was over until bills started coming in. I live with my mom but her health is failing too and the last thing i want to have happen is us go to a nursing home where we could be abused at worst or be left in pee, etc. Our house is handicap accessible, 3ft wide doors, etc in case a wheel chair is ever needed.  


If any proof is needed i can provide debit card amount that SSA goes to as well as my SS# with last 4 digits blacked out, but that will take a bit. As far as what happened last  year, and to the Cerebral Palsy and the actual gofundme that's below. By the  way there are a bunch of post from 7yrs and past if someone knows how to search them, I dont.

,My dad was badly scalded on my birthday.,"**Go Fund Me page:** [**gf.me/u/wn4dh3**](https://gf.me/u/wn4dh3) **(Please take note, photos of the wounds may be disturbing for some viewers)**

After many years, I finally had the chance going on a vacation with my family to a beach resort. It was on my birthday, and everything was going really well. We had a wonderful time at the beach, soaking in the sea, and playing at the pool. It was a very special birthday for me.

But things turned south when my dad went to the public bathroom. He went to wash the sand off his feet in the shower, instead of simply washing it in the swimming pool. My dad wanted to save the maintenance staff the trouble of cleaning the sand from the swimming pool. But when my dad turned on the tap, the water was so hot and it immediately scalded his foot! My dad was feeling the searing pain for a solid few hours before he received medical attention. He wanted to be a good and considerate citizen and this is what he got in return.

We complained to the hotel management that they had to do something before the hot water causes serious injuries on someone else, like a small child or an elderly person.

It has been a few days, and my dad's injuries don't seem to get any better, and the medical bills are much higher than we expected. He will have to make several visits every week to change his wound dressings and the nearest clinic is quite a distance away, so we have transportation costs as well.

I did not expect such a painful and terrible thing to happen to my dad on my birthday. It really sucks.

Please support my dad through our Go Fund Me campaign. Any amount would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for your time."

Hi everyone,

I am creating this post because I need some help. I have been through hell and back in my adult life. After high school, I joined the military and served my country. I got out and began my dream career as a chef. I worked my teenage years in kitchens and knew this was the career I loved. The military was something I did spontaneously last second instead of going to culinary school. After I got out of the military, I began working and climbing the ladder in kitchens. I got an inguinal hernia which required surgery. I had synthetic mesh surgically placed in my body and began to heal. Unfortunately, the mesh was defective and caused nerve tumors to develop and created constant agonizing pain. I never recovered from surgery and began to lose my career. I had a second surgery to try and replace the mesh. It made things worse. I nearly died at this point because I just could not function. I lost relationships and my love of life. I had another surgery to remove the nerves. This was temporarily successful but the nerves grew back. I have fought through the pain and have reached a point that I can't continue. I am not able to be the chef and do the hard work required for success. I need a new career and need to go back to college. I have created a Go Fund Me to start this journey. I have no money and these medical issues have ruined me financially. If you can please click the link, it describes in further detail my journey these medical problems took me on. Thank you, enjoy your holiday season."

,Help a family with 2 kids recover from a home fire,"Hi, I'm just trying to help a family out. They had a pretty significant home fire and could use a helping hand at getting their lives back together.

,My friend who has fostered countless animals on her own dime and recently helped me greatly is facing a large emergency vet bill. I’m seeking help for her because I wish I could give back right now. (Xposted from r/GoFundMe),"Verification: https://imgur.com/a/adnOknS 

My friend has loved and taken care of animals for as long as I’ve known her, fostering and rehoming cats, a couple of raccoons and dogs on her own dime. She’s helped to pay medical bills/spay and neuter fees for people who could not afford them, and she routinely catches and takes in community cats for spaying/neutering. I can’t tell you how many times she has bottle-fed or otherwise taken care of animals that needed serious care for disabilities or other illnesses, and I have never once seen her ask for help.

All along, she has maintained the health of her big pupper, Donnie. He has been by her side for 10 years now, and I know she’s not ready to see him go. In the description of her GoFundMe, she details how a mass in his spleen ruptured this weekend and he needed an emergency surgery, which is going to cost $5-6k. Being the way she is, she is only requesting $3k on her GoFundMe. 

To add to all of this, she recently gave my husband and I a good chunk of change to help cover bills while we are struggling after a death in the family and lots of life changes. I want so badly to be able to return all that she gave to us and then some, but because that money went straight into bills, we aren’t in a position to do that yet. That’s why I’m hoping to beef up her campaign with the help of internet strangers. 

If any of you are willing to donate to this cause or share the post with any animal lovers you know, I would very much appreciate it. Thank you!

*Note: I hope the way she titled her GFM doesn’t go against the rules—I thought this was OK because it isn’t specifically holiday-themed.*

,I'm looking for advice on setting up a charity,"Title says it all.  I trying to help out a charity, Hawkwing.org, and would appreciate any advice.  Currently we're only going on word of mouth, so any constructive suggestions would be welcome!  Just to clear up, I'm not actually looking for money (well, we are, so if you want to donate, it'd be welcome!).  I'm looking for suggestions on helping Hawkwing grow.  It's a charity that supports the Cheyenne River Reservation, one of the most blighted places imaginable.  The life expediency is 48, unemployment is 90%, the electrical grid is spotty at best, and the water system doesn't exist for most of the reservation.  I'm trying to build an ad campaign to bring it to greater attention.  It's the fourth largest Native American Reservation, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs basically does nothing to help, so it's up to Hawkwing and those willing to chip in to fix it.

Thanks in advance."

,Donate to Help Teens Make Music,"Hello,

A few years ago, I was a freshman in high school. I  was just getting serious about music. One teacher, who taught guitar, percussion, music industry, and more told me I needed to take music seriously, and pursue my dream. He said I should form a band, and take this band seriously, telling me that I should never give up. Now, two years later, I have a band, and we are fairly successful. We have played a lot in the last two years, at block parties, local street fairs, restaurants, a homeless shelter, and for benefits and fundraisers for non-profits and other good causes. The band plays everything from R&B, to soul, to pop., Along with around 10 other friends, we absolutely love this band. And we're all teens, ages 13 to 19 in the Southland Chicago area. Our number one mission: to make our community happy through music. No matter how good or bad the band is, young kids playing music makes our neighbors happy. I love the feeling of seeing people smiling once they see and hear  us, and that we're all young. Spreading positivity throughout the community brings me joy. We'd love if this band can keep going for as long as possible. I've gotten to the point where I want to take the band seriously, rather than just a hobby. It's all ready made me some profit too. However, to sustain this project, we need new equipment. We're missing lots of essential gear for performing. And the stuff we do have is lower quality, and also getting older, experiencing some wear and tear. I am writing today to ask your to support my [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-teen-band-timeless). For the past few months I've been looking into getting brand new equipment. I have found the necessary stuff. I am hoping to raise money so we can buy new gear. This includes sound equipment to use live on stage for performances, sound equipment for audio recording, stage lights, and newer instruments and accessories. Not only would this equipment be great for performances, but it would help us have more productive rehearsals, which would help get better. High quality audio recording gear would be great for promoting this business. We could release our original music as well! 

If we could surpass by goal of $30,000 on my [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-teen-band-timeless), we could buy ALL of this equipment, and more. I have wishlists full of stuff. Please check out the GoFundMe, and donate anything, small or BIG. If you are unable to do this, please SHARE! Share the link with as many people as possible. Around this time, everything is on sale, so I'd like to make some purchases as soon as I possibly can. Please do anything you can to support my dream. And my mission to make bring music and joy to my community. Thank you so much!!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-adam-take-care-of-his-mom?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet

My mom has been fighting stage 4 colon cancer for a little over 3 years now. The spread has overtaken treatment and there’s nothing more the doctors can do. 

Medicaid and Medicare allow for at home hospice care, and she has elected to die at home. During this time though. I cannot work. She needs more supervision than the hour or two the nurses are around a week. I have some PTO  but that will pretty much take me to the end of October. 

I reached out on social media to tell friends and family the situation and actually to offer to sell paintings I had done at basically whatever price that was offered. And my wonderful friends responded by starting a GoFundMe. I’m grateful to them, and doing what I can to help awareness of their campaign at this time.

Update: Mom passed on the 31st of October. And although I found mom had a life insurance policy it is only going to pay 5% of its value due to being less than two years old. 
So the GoFundMe is still needed to finish out her accounts and get things back on track.

Thank you Reddit for your time"

,Medical Bills for Stage 4 Lung Cancer Treatment,"This is for my ex wife's family. Very sad news this week. 


https://www.gofundme.com/f/medical-bills-for-cancer-treatment-amp-family-vaca?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet

On November 5, 2019, my step-father, Bruce (or Bonus Dad as I like to call him) was given the worst news he could hear. He was diagnosed with Stage 4, Single Cell Lung Cancer that has also moved to his Liver. He has been given 8-12 months to live with the possibility of up to 2 years with Chemo treatment. 

This was not a diagnosis that he, his wife, his 2 children, his 2 grandchildren and myself were expecting. We are all devastated, to say the least. 
Now comes the long road of Chemotherapy that starts on November 12, 2019.  We all know this is going to be an extremely trying time in the family and all we can do is just be there for Bruce. Positive thoughts, hold his hand through his Chemo sessions, a shoulder to cry on or just someone to sit silently with knowing they care and love for him tremendously.  We aren't sure of the numbers yet, but we know this is going to cost tens of thousands of dollars, if not more. With only his wife (my mother) working, this is going to cause the doctor bills to add up way faster than she can think of even paying them. They are both very humble people that don't ask for anything from anyone for any reason. This is why I feel the need to express the need for assistance. The guards need to be drop and acceptance to realize help is needed.

Bruce and I talked in depth the first night about the diagnosis and what the steps are that we will need to take as a family. It's not going to be easy and we all need to rally together.  We have been a blended family since October 4, 2001. My mother and I blended families with Bruce and his two children, Nikki and Billy. In the 18 years that we have become one, we have NEVER had the opportunity to take a family vacation.  Bruce's doctor told him that if he has anything left on his bucket list, to complete it within the next few months. Yes....we are in desperate need for help with medical bills...but his wish is that the entire family mentioned above take an actual family vacation together while we still have the chance.  He wants to have all of us go to Florida, stick out feet in the sand, enjoy the ocean and just be care free for a few days. 

My goal is to document this journey that he is going to be taking and give him all the support possible. To care and love for him as we have over the years and not let anything else change the time we have together.

Anything will help. Even a share. Please help my family during this trying time to just stay on our feet with your positive words."

,"Bill, severely disabled, will be homeless by the end of the year","Bill has been struggling with a debilitating medical condition for over six years. He has fought hard to survive, but his funds are now depleted. He will be homeless in 6 weeks unless help is given quickly.

Bill has been given the generic diagnosis of fibromyalgia and CFS/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue) but is one of the worst cases ever observed as far as symptoms and capability goes. It makes it nearly impossible for him to care for himself. He experiences chronic muscle pain across his entire body and frequently lapses into a coma-like state for days at a time. He is too weak to leave his house on his own, even for doctor appointments. He needs more medical tests to discover the underlying issues.

Your donation will help Bill keep from being homeless as well as allow him to, once again, receive medical tests that he so desperately needs to diagnose his condition. Without help, Bill will lose everything he has left and with his inability to move without assistance, he may face a terrible fate.

We also need help finding:

\- Anyone familiar with California real estate law. Bill does not have the means to get another place and will be homeless by Christmas. His house is nearly paid off, but if the bank takes it, they’ll steal all the equity he has in it. We’re trying to save his house so he has time to sell it, downsize, and use the rest of the money to survive and pay for medical tests.

\- Someone familiar with Social Security disability cases and procedures to get his deserved Social Security benefits. Bill has tried surviving on his own for as long as he can, but now is being told that since it's been so long since he worked, his 25 years of work credits will not likely make him eligible for SSDI. The hearing is set for February, but he needs help getting the paperwork ready.

\- Any tax accountants willing to do his State taxes over again pro bono.

Please give what you can, but also share this story with your friends, family, co-workers, church groups, all your social networks, and strongly encourage your friends to do the same. This needs to spread as far as possible to have any chance of saving Bill. Thank you.

,Famiky of 4 Facing Homelessness,"On the 28th of October, my family of 4 have began living in a hotel because of  change of career for my husband. We moved from North Carolina, leaving 99% of our belongings in a storage unit. 

When we arrived at the hotel we were told that we would pay for the first week, and then the rest at check out. Which was fine, because my husband would receive his first paycheck on our check out date. Which would leave money for a deposit for a home.

I have been house hunting all the past week, and suddeny we were called after 1 full week saying we owe for the week. Confused, we argued with the lady who did not care about our situation and just wanted us to pay. We had the funds, but now we do not have anymore.

We cannot afford one more week, groceries for my children, or even to do laundry at the coin-op laundromat.

We are asking for help in gathering funds to pay for the rest of our stay at the hotel. We need the funds as soon as Sunday the 10th of November. My husband will not receive his first paycheck from his new job until the 15th.

If we do not pay this on Sunday myself, husband and both of my toddlers will be living on the streets. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

,Let There Be Light - 1st Grade Glow Day Transformation To Learn About Light and Shadows,"If you have it in your budget, please consider making a small donation to my stepson's teacher at Burgess-Peterson Academy in Atlanta, GA for a Glow Day Transformation. This project is intended to engage the students in understanding light and shadows. As of this morning, there is only $102 remaining for her project to be fully funded.   

&#x200B;

Mrs. Watts-Blount has done a beautiful job of describing her students and purpose of the glow day project on her Donors Choose page. I have copied her words and linked the Donors Choose page below:

### My Students

My first grade students are inquisitive and vibrant learners within an urban, high poverty school district. Our school collaborates, empowers, and pushes our students to do their very best.

>*Despite challenges my students face, each student tries their best to achieve academically and social emotionally.*

From the moment students step into the classroom, they are greeted at the door, are engaged in their learning, and work hard across all subject areas. We work on having a growth mindset to push past barriers and achieve - never giving up.

### My Project

My students love to learn through engaging, hands-on activities. There is nothing better than having students engaged through a huge themed, classroom transformation! We need to transform our room for a Glow Day of learning as we inquire about light and shadows. To do this, we need black lights, neon lights and tape, glowing balloons, and glow sticks! These are not your typical classroom supplies, so your donations will help me transform my class into a total day of learning about light and shadows. Without your help, it wouldn't be possible.

>*SCIENCE SHOULD BE FUN with active lessons for lifelong learning memories!*

Just imagine: you are handed a set of glow stick glasses by your teacher, walk into your first grade classroom, and ""WOW!"" - the room has been completely transformed into a glowing, neon lit learning environment. This is just the start for a truly amazing learning experience, and what my student deserve and need to make scientific connections. I love to set the stage to engage in my classroom - this day of light discovery through Glow Day Games will be the ultimate day of learning.

Nine years ago, Kit came into my life. At only a few weeks old, this little Shiba Inu saved my life. I was severely depressed at the time and having him with me meant that things started to seem better, lighter and happier. Kit and I have gone through a lot together but he has always been a constant, a blessing and a joy. He's had some close calls. A few years ago he was bitten by a Tiger Snake and barely survived. Then, not long after that, he was hit by a car. Again, he was lucky and survived.

This year, he was sadly diagnosed with Diabetes which means he requires injections of insulin twice a day. However, 80% of dogs diagnosed with Diabetes, develop cataracts in the first 12 months. Kit has developed cataracts and needs surgery to remove them and get his life back. Since cataracts have developed, Kit has aged considerably. He sleeps a lot more, is less active and less interested in daily activities. 

The cost is $6,000 but we are unable to fully pay for it as I was diagnosed with testicular cancer this year and had to fund the surgery and treatment of that.

I'd love to get his eye's fixed so he can live a normal life again and so that he has the best possible last few years. I also want my 18-month-old son to be able to grow up with Kit at his best.

Thank you in advance for any and all help

http://gofundme.com/rentalscam


""Me, my good friend Alex, and his family were looking for a house to rent, and i found what seemed to be a great choice for us on facebook. Sean Sharad Smith posted a house for rent on Sept 2nd. We met him, he claimed to be the owner, and we signed a lease with him on Sept 6th. On Oct. 17th, we found an eviction notice taped to our door stating that Sean needed to move out by Nov 12th or the owner would come to remove his stuff from the property. After doing some research we found out Sean was never the owner, and was brought to court on Aug 16th for not paying rent. He knowingly rented the house out to us, knowing we would be evicted on Nov 12th. There is a good chance now that me, Alex, his wife, his 3 year old son, and his mom will be without a place to live very soon, even though we have paid our bills on time. We got a lawyer, and he thinks he can work something out with the actual company that owns the home, along with suing Sean, but even if that happens we will still have to pay another deposit. Along with deposits for utilities because the supposed landlord claimed he was covering those in our rent."""

,Emergency Assistance for Rent,"
My name is Zubair Niloy. I am currently a sophomore who is attending my local community college in order to get a degree in computer science. I aspire to work with code and create programs that people can use. As everyone knows college classes don't come cheap, and to pay for these classes I work part-time in order to pay off the classes and survive. I live with my mother and father, who are both peaking in age. My father being 60 and my mother following not far behind. We are a struggling family who barely meet ends meet each month. With both attempting to pay for school and trying to help my family pay for bills we barely have anything left to show. A month ago however, I was informed that I would be let go from a stable nine to five job I had in order to sustain our household and pay for my tuition. Suddenly our family has gone from scrapping by to being close to eviction. Both my parents  work, however due to their age it is hard for them to work anywhere near the hours needed to pay for everything. With the remaining money that we have left, it would be hard for me to keep up with my tuition payments and pay for rent which I am already behind on.  I have recently found a stable job  that is not seasonal and will keep this from happening again, but as of right now I really need  help in order to pay for the upcoming month's rent which would be due on the 15th.  I’m hoping that whoever reads this can help out in anyway possible. Thank you very much in advance.

***TRIGGER WARNING***

-sexual assault/child abuse/suicide-


This is a very difficult time for my family and I. We need your love, support, respect and empathy. Please respect this time and do not contact with questions about details or judgments- please trust in the fact that everything leading up to what happened was handled correctly in the parenting aspect and the perpetrator fooled EVERYONE who lived in our complex and knew him for years. I will explain everything as best as I can when the time is right.

Thank you.



Hello everyone, so this is some heavy stuff, but 2 months ago on August 25th-26th, a neighbor, over a period of 15 hours during a sleepover with his friend (which I would never ever normally allow- family ONLY- but it was 3 doors down, and my son was distraught over his friend moving), molested and sexually assaulted my 8 year old son. Then later the next day, on the 26th, when he finished my son, he TRIED to move onto my 6 year old daughter after all the kids went swimming and went to play video games.  She got out of there without anything happening TO her, only what he made her do to him- which was nearly next to nothing, thank goodness, even though he promised her anything she wanted if she kept it a secret and did whatever he wanted- she still said no way. She came home and immediately told me what he tried to do and it was handled from there legally by law enforcement- but this story is for a different time.


I saw my children go through exams and procedures a parent should never have to experience; THEY should never have to feel or have done. I heard them say things and answer questions they should never have to explain or understand at this time in their innocent lives. My son was put on special preventative HIV Prophylactic Medications for 28 days with periodic blood testing due to the dangers of the medication's chemistry on his organs.


My son has High Functioning Autism and both my children have PTSD (so he saw them as easy targets- especially since my daughter was the only girl and small for her age and my son's diagnosis) from Physical/Emotional abuse from their father and his girlfriend who kept them hidden and blocked from me and  all family for one year 4 years ago. (He is far away and has nothing to do with them now). A few weeks after the assault, my son did his forensic interview and 3 days later tried to commit suicide at school and was hospitalized for 3 weeks. He was unable to do his interview at the time of the assault and exam because he shut down and went into traumatic shock for 3 days.


It has been 2 months since it happened and I have not been able to work- my savings and access to funds have run out. My children have only recently started sleeping in their room again and letting me go to the store without them for an hour. There are a lot of different therapy and psych appts, meds, advocacy and investigations going on- plus school stuff. I am a single mother with minimal help and support system. The sick perpetrator is in jail and my immediate family lives across the country. My funds have run out quicker than expected and while I have a part time job getting ready to begin, I am 3k behind on everything including rent, electric, gas, and basic needs for my home like soap, laundry, dish stuff, etc.


I did not want to post on my personal page, and I do not know how to ask people for help or fundraise, it's not something I do; I am hesitant to explain why to such a large audience.


I am at a loss and I don't know what else to do. I can't do much more than reach out. I'm already upset I am in this position to even have to ask. It never crossed my mind to do crowdfunding or reach out on social media but if I felt if I did it on my personal page, there would be people who will use it and exploit it; I can not have that happen to my children. They are still dealing with a lot and will be for a long time.

We have resources coming out our ears for EVERYTHING except financial. I don't need ongoing either, just 3k to break even and catch up so we don't go homeless, lose electricity, do laundry, can get basic home needs and gas for appts, etc.


Arizona is a fucking joke for financial resources in cases such as this. There is a Victim's Compensation Grant but that can take 90 days to a year to be approved. I am pursuing it and will get approved, but until then we have nothing. I do have a job starting soon, just not in time to pay my bills by the first and things have fallen behind. I have about 23 bucks in my checking account.


I have exhausted every option and resource I can find first, then I came here to all of you as a VERY LAST RESORT on someone else's suggestion from a group I am in.

So, yea. I don't know how to do this or what else to say. I'm just scared for so many reasons and doing my best to maintain routine and normalcy so my children can hold onto their childhood and innocence as best as possible. I will put aside all my stubborn pride and embrace humility to provide for them.

The attached article is about the ongoing investigation and case. This is not the first time this monster has done this, but it WILL be the last. A previous case was brought against him and dropped- due to ""lack of evidence.""

It has since been reopened. Other children are coming forward as well, since the article came out and time has gone on.

Thank you for reading this far, thank you for your support and understanding during this time.


I am doing PayPal and GoFundMe as one charges a fee but others are more comfortable with it. There is even Facebook Pay through Messenger if that's easier. I will keep the fundraising updated as often as I can.


Every little bit helps- everything from $5 to $500 makes a difference.

,Day to DM 26 -- University of Iowa Dance Marathon (supports kids with pediatric cancer),"Hey /r/Charity,

For the next 26.2 hours, University of Iowa Dance Marathon is trying to fundraise as much money as possible for our yearly fundraising push day — Day to DM!

As you may/may not know, I am involved in an organization on my university campus called Dance Marathon. Dance Marathon financially and emotionally supports children with pediatric cancer and their families. Our primary impact lies with assisting children in the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital, but we also have contributed a lot of money towards research to help fund pediatric cancer!

One huge example of our presence both on campus, in Iowa, and across the country is our newest Hawkeye tradition: The Hawkeye Wave! After the first quarter of our college football games, we turn towards the hospital and wave to the kids. It’s a big reason why I continue being part of Dance Marathon and staying motivated to join the fight against pediatric cancer. Here’s a video to get some context and perspective on how I feel: [https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/video/1315411011912](https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/video/1315411011912)

Today is Day to DM, a day where our organization is trying to raise as much as possible in just 24 hours! Our goal is to raise $500,000 today!! Every donation truly matters, as 100% of donations DIRECTLY support our children and families.

This year, our slogan for the organization is “We Fight Together”. So my question to you is, will you join me in the fight against pediatric cancer? If you would like to make a donation to this amazing organization and help us reach $500,000 today for the kids, you can follow the link below to donate!

,In need of a computer that will last me through school,"Hello everyone, my name is Christian, otherwise known as ""Solemn"" online. Given my current situation, I am unable to search for work. I am living with my parents as I go through college, taking the minimum amount of classes as possible because we 1. Can't afford all of them at once and 2. Can't apply for financial aid due to more complicated issues.

When I started my first semester of community college, I got what seemed to be a nice laptop that would last me through all four years of school as well as some time afterwards. Unfortunately, fate wasn't on my side and this wasn't nearly the case. My warranty is already over, and I've had to replace the fan in it myself. But now the battery has a low capacity and I get a black screen whenever I turn it on. I basically can't use it without it being plugged in. This doesn't help when I have assignments to do and am unable to access a computer. The classes I take are either online or hybrid (online and in person) and without a working computer at home, things will be impossible to complete.

Not only do I want to get a computer to help me get through school, I want to go ahead and spend a bit more money now to get a computer that I will be able to create content for platforms like YouTube and Twitch. A friend and I stream a podcast on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and having a decent desktop computer would really help with the production of it.

My goal for this fundraiser is to reach $1,600 for the parts to build a PC that I know will last a long time. At the time of writing this, I've already received $5 which doesn't seem like a lot, but if anyone feels like helping out a student/content creator, any amount would be greatly appreciated. Everyone who donates will receive a shout out in a thank you video I plan on putting together whenever I reach my goal unless they choose to remain anonymous, (in which case you can send a note with your donation stating that you would like to remain anonymous.) And as an added incentive, I plan on holding a few charity streams that go to actual charities in the future once I finally get this PC built.

In the meantime, thank you to everyone who read this. This is basically just repeated in the description of the GoFundMe page, but if you have any questions feel free to ask.

,Help Phi Delta Theta and Live Like Lou fight ALS by donating to Iron Phi,"This year, I'll be attempting to become an Iron Phi - a distinction given to a small percentage of members within my Fraternity. The mission of Iron Phi is to strengthen the Phi Delta Theta International Fraternity and the impact it has on the fight against Lou Gehrig's disease through the fundraising and athletic efforts of its members. Lou Gehrig was a member of Phi Delta Theta, and our organization has taken an active role in finding a cure.

The net proceeds will support ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) research, education, screening and treatment. It will also help strengthen an organization (Phi Delta Theta) that has had a lasting impact on my life.

In addition to raising the cash amount of $1000, I will also be running a 24 hour charity live stream on Mixer.com/KrittR. All donations from that live stream will go directly to my Iron Phi campaign. During the live stream I will be playing a variety of video games and will include options to donate certain cash amounts to force me to do something in game or out of game such as drop my weapon, play lefty, do pushups, or play an audio clip. Donors will also be able to donate to share YouTube videos or messages of support. While I would love to stay awake for 24 straight hours, there is no way that is going to happen, so, I will have other ways to interact with the stream while I sleep in short shifts.

Approximately 5,600 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS each year. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death. That's why I'm becoming an Iron Phi. To do something bold about Lou Gehrig's disease.

Proud to be

Hello everyone. A dear friend of mine, Jessica, a waitress in a restaurant in town, is grieving with the loss of her oldest son, Jordin Tenk (15 years old), who was found dead in the woods behind her house from an apparent suicide. There was a three day search before his body was found  at 12:30 pm, on 10/28/2019. 

His mother has always just barely scraped by financially, however it has never stopped her from giving the shirt of her back to put a smile on someone's face. I was a friend to Jordin, and I feel like I need to help in some way, so I come to you, reddit, because I know how much you call care and how self-less this wonderful platform is, to help the mother of Jordin in her time of need, because I know for a fact she would do the same for anyone else.

Why plant trees?

\- Reforestation has been identified as the #1 most effective and affordable solution for climate mitigation in a peer-reviewed study by scientists in over 15 institutions around the world.

\- Trees clean the air we breathe and the water we drink. They also contribute to a stable climate and overall health, support wildlife and biodiversity, and provide a positive social impact.

\- Deforestation has increased dramatically around the world. In 2017 alone, the Earth lost 40 football fields worth of forests every SECOND - due to logging, mining, cattle grazing, forest fires, and poor forest management practices. We can't undo all of that, but we can help in the work of restoration.

\- I love trees! Don't you? They are the pillars of our outdoor adventures, an endless source of inspiration, and create stunning landscapes I hope to enjoy for many years to come.

Your support would mean the world to me... and to the world itself! Every little bit helps, so please donate whatever you can.

The process is fast, easy and secure. Thanks so much for your support... and please don't forget to send this page to any friends you think might be interested in donating.

,Crypto-Philantrophy," 

To run a successful organization, raising and managing funds are paramount. Donations are the fueling need for nonprofits to survive for longer periods. There are multiple methods and platforms both online and offline for nonprofits to ask for donations. So the fundraising took the internet by storm in this digital era using different concepts.

Fundraising is the lifeblood of charities and is of great importance to nonprofits. Most nonprofit/nongovernmental organizations rely on fundraising to cover the costs of campaigns and programs driving social impact.

**Bitcoin fundraising**

Over the last few years, a large number of charities and foundations have been trialing Bitcoin donations. These include well-known organizations like the Red Cross, Save the Children, United Way, the Wikimedia Foundation, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Once established, an online “wallet” allows charity institutions to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrency donations and these are later exchanged for fiat currencies such as the dollar. In some cases, online wallet providers offer 0% processing fees for nonprofits, compared to the 2% or more required by traditional donation processors. This means, potentially 100% of donations can end up in the pockets of charity organizations or donation recipients. Bitcoin donations to charities are also tax-deductible and offer donors the added benefit of avoiding capital gains taxes on the dollar amount value of their cryptocurrency donations.

In the United States, it is difficult to say how much money has been generated through bitcoin and other digital currency donations. There is evidence to suggest that bitcoin transactions are on the rise. Fidelity Charitable, which houses the nation’s largest donor-advised fund, reportedly received $69 million in cryptocurrency donations in 2017, up from $7 million received in 2015 and 2016 combined.

In addition to direct digital currency donations, there are a variety of other innovative and unique platforms and projects underway in the emerging “crypto-philanthropy” space.

**Conclusion**

If there is greater transparency in giving and impact does lead to increased confidence in charities, Millions (or even billions) of dollars more could be generated for the social sector.

Now is the time for philanthropists, foundations, and nonprofits to come together with social entrepreneurs, blockchain visionaries, and technologists to collectively guide the direction of crypto-philanthropy. The future of giving is for all of us to imagine and create, built on our common love of giving back.

The short version is that my partner and I are both possessed of mental conditions which make life extremely difficult to navigate. Work environment stress is typically enough to push me into a breakdown within six months, and most employers don't consider high functioning autism worth working around.

We've cut our lives down to something we could manage for a few hundred dollars a month, but the push to get away from the coast caused a particularly frustrating new mess of problems. The resulting fire will require more care to remedy than we were prepared to undertake. In addition, we've been forced out of having a stable place to even park, now that our RV will no longer start.

,Raising money against homelessness for the next week.,"Last Friday, on the 18th of October, I volunteered to stay outside for the night to raise money for YMCA UK's Sleep Easy event. They are currently one of the biggest providers of safe sleeping areas for homeless people in the UK, and also support them with advice, training, and other support programmes. You can find more details at ymca.org.uk

And now for my experience.
My shelter for the night consisted of 3 cardboard boxes (with the shape and comfort of a coffin) and a section of a sheet of tarpaulin. The periodic flurries of wind and rain made it impossible to sleep for any length of time, while every waking moment was spent getting more and more worried for my rapidly sagging ceiling. Somehow, I managed to survive the night with a combined total of about 35 minutes of sleep in my cramped little space and in the morning, cleared the sports court that we used.

,Friend lost his house and two cats in a fire.,"[Dustin Allen Recovery Fund](http://gf.me/u/v6hvbt)

On October 17th, in the middle of the night, a faulty outlet sparked a fire that would change Dustin Allen's life within minutes.

Dustin called this his home for over thirteen years where he raised his son and two cats. He and his roommate managed to escape, but Dustin went back in for his cats. Unfortunately, they perished in the flames and he received numerous burns across his body. He is currently being treated at Wake Forest Medical Center.

If you know Dustin you know how much he has struggled over the years to support himself, his kid, and his two cats. He has lost almost everything from this fire. Those cats meant the world to him.

While his medical expenses are expected to be very high, I do not expect this Go Fund Me to cover those costs, nor do I expect the goal to be met but every dollar helps. He will be jobless until he can make a full recovery.

In the meantime he will need food, clothing, and a vehicle to get back on his feet.

Please keep him in your thoughts and say a prayer for his cats. They will be greatly missed.

I'm posting this to help a friend of mine that has had an UNBELIEVABLY (like, if I saw a movie of this, about 10 percent of the way through I'd call bullshit and leave...) challenging year. And yet SHE WILL NOT STOP LOOKING UP AND MOVING FORWARD. I'm astounded by her unrelenting optimism and resilience.

,Please help our paralympic champions!,"Hi everyone,

I've been a lurker for years, and decided to join and post for a good cause. You've probably all heard about the Paralympic where athletes with a range of disabilities compete in multiple sports. While some of us (I know I do!) can't seem to find the motivation to go to the gym a few times a week and justify it with various excuses (too tired, worked too late, don't have time, etc), some people with paraplegia, amputations or even vision impairment are an incredible inspiration by training hard and showing extraordinary determination and discipline by skiing on one leg or playing basketball in a wheelchair (!)

In order to encourage these people and show our support, I will be participating at the ParaTough Cup in Montreal on November 7, 2019  ( [https://paralympic.ca/montreal](https://paralympic.ca/montreal) ) and I'm raising money for the Canadian Paralympic Foundation. On top of raising money, I will also be participating in multiple parasports such as running with a blindfold or playing volleyball in a wheelchair in order to feel how it is to compete with a handicap. 

If you have a dollar to spare, it would be greatly appreciated if you can encourage me in raising funds for this beautiful cause and our future canadian paralympic champions! You can donate here : [https://www.canadahelps.org/me/2ZYqaMs](https://www.canadahelps.org/me/2ZYqaMs)

,Help me become a therapist," Hello!

My  name is Jeffrey, I am a graduate student looking to become a therapist  specializing in LGBTQ+ youth and young adults. I am currently in the  Advanced Standing Program which is a fast track to getting my Master's  but requires a lot of time and studying. Instead of having a normal  semester where the class goes from September to December classes are  condensed so that I am doing a semester worth of work. research, and  papers in about a month. On top of this I am also required to spend a  good deal of my time in an internship placement. As it stands I am  taking the maximum amount of loans possible and it still might not be  enough.

I have long struggled with my faith and my sexuality, being raised  Christian and discovering I was gay. I developed severe long term  depression and frequently had suicidal thoughts. I never received help, and it took me years and a     few scares to finally pull through, I never want that to happen to another. I decided to start my path to becoming a  therapist specializing in LGBTQ+ youth. Every step in my education have further solidified my passion for social work and helping others. My professors   have each commented on my empathy and  professionalism. I successfully convinced my class to run the first-ever LGBTQ+ event   for our Macro   Studies class. I was able to lead the class  to run one of the most successful events ever where we brought in surrounding GSA (Gay Straight Alliance) students to learn about resources available to them   and that the community cares. With the Help of the South Coast LGBT network, we had over 100 people in attendance, when typically these events have about 20. With the help of so many and  my   class, I was able to fulfill a life goal of mine, and I know I  can do  so  much to help if given the opportunity.

I    just  wanted to thank you for spending the time reading this, and if you were able to donate; Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, Thank you, every dollar is one step closer to me becoming a  therapist and helping others and help prevent them from going through what I did. 

Please feel free to contact me for more information or if I can improve this post. Thank you.

tl:dr I want to help people, especially lgbtq+ youth as a therapist but I am lacking in funds

I  should also mention that it is difficult for me to get grants and     scholarships because the program is technically part-time despite the   work and internship requirements being full time.

,Kids Wheelchair Basketball team needs help to go to Nationals,"My 12 year old son has a progressive neurological disease that, starting around age 5, has slowly been taking his ability to use his legs.   
At first, he was scared and angry about what was happening to his body... he was afraid to try any physical activities, feeling like he couldn't compare to ""normal"" kids. 

Then he started playing wheelchair basketball, and it changed his life. I've watched him become more confident, independent, and driven as he works to become his best with other kids who are just as driven and passionate as he is. 

They have a shot at playing in Nationals, which will get them exposure to college coaches and can lead them to college scholarships for athletics, etc...  

The only obstacle is that it requires a lot of travel for the team to play in the 3 tournaments they'll need to play in order to qualify for nationals, and then Nationals will require travel as well.  

All in all, it will take about $35,000 to get the Utah Rush Wheelchair Basketball team to nationals.    These kids are working hard on fundraisers, and finding corporate sponsors, working sidejobs, doing whatever they have to do.  

Can you help them?  Any amount helps, it all adds up.  

You can donate directly to the Utah Rush Wheelchair Basketball team by donating to the 501c organization that they play for.  It's called Neuroworx, located in Sandy, UT.

,Help me help my dad,"Back in November of 2018, my parents and I (16F) sold our house in the middle of suburbia to move onto an abandoned farm. We planned to bring our horses, who we board at a friend’s house, onto our property, as well as welcome some egg laying hens and dairy goats into our family. We were also planning on moving my maternal grandmother onto the property in her own mobile home. Her mortgage was killing her, and she had always wanted to live this sort of life anyways. This is where things got sticky.
She found the perfect mobile home, snatched it up, found a mover, and put her house on the market. She couldn’t afford it on her own, so my dad took out a loan for her. To make a long story short, the mover scammed us, we got a new mover, and the mobile home caved in in the middle of the moving process. My grandmother is now living in our house with her four dogs, our two dogs, and our cat, and my father is now out over $15,000. We can’t afford to develop our homestead like we had dreamed of because of this.
What I am asking is that you help me help my dad pay off the loans so that my grandmother can find a new mobile home. I try to help, but I can only do so much whilst working a minimum wage job. 
Any and all extra funding will go towards fencing and farm development.

,Snow White Needs Your Help,"A friend of mine wanted me to post on here as she doesn't have an account able to post on here. She says that Joanie is wholesome like Snow White.

&nbsp;

A message from the husband.  

&nbsp;

My wife, Joanie, has had a really tough September. She had an agonizing late night on September 6, when Dorian was coming ashore. Nothing helped her pain and we called 911—transferred to (local hospital) and they couldn’t help with the cause of the pain, only manage the symptoms. She was transported to Duke Regional Hospital at 8pm Sep 7 and underwent emergency surgery at 6am Saturday Sep 8. Saved her life. I got to bring her home Tuesday Sept 10. She had issues with keeping food down after a tough week at home. We went back to Duke to have 24 staples removed. Doctors ran some tests and decided to admit her, to get her strength up and determine the cause of the nausea and dehydration. After a week they installed a picc line to feed her intravenously nutrients, vitamins, and a bunch of other stuff. I found out her insurance would not cover the picc line outside the hospital and she needs 4-6 months of picc line maintenance at home. They kept her another week to get insurance approval, to get me trained on maintenance of the picc line, including how to replace the nutrient bags, clean the ports and keep her input site sanitized and free of infection. It’s terrifying. An infection in the picc line will travel quickly to her heart. We got approval for insurance with a co-pay of 420.60 per week. We are hoping the picc line will allow her to heal and will be removed by Christmas. If you can help, bless you. If you cannot, please share this post and we thank you.

,I am desperate for a new mobility scooter. Can you help?,"Hello there. I am Kitty. I am 29, and I am disabled and really struggle getting around. I am in a lot of pain most of the day. Money isn't good at the moment and I've been playing a lot of catch up financially. My mobility scooter I bought I was kind of ripped off, it was second hand, and it's completely broke now. I am trying to fundraise for a reliable one that won't break, will help me feel safer on the road and will suit my needs. I am donating my own money where I can out of my disability allowance, but I'm asking for a little help. Colder months are approaching, the cold on my limbs and slippery ice and snow make it painful and perhaps even dangerous to get around, and winter is creeping already. If you can donate or even perhaps share my fundraiser I would be grateful. I have £245 out of £1100 raise so far. I was raising via Facebook and was doing well, but facebook was effecting my mental health. Alas as my time on facebook came to an end, donations stopped. I don't have many friends or close family who can help me make progress. 

With reddits help my quality of life can improve by a million. Every donation and share helps.  Thanks so much. I hope this doesn't break the rules, its not so much a personal request like rent, I'm literally not managing simple things like a proper grocery shop, sometimes even the school run. Sadly under the UK PIP system I was a measly 2 points short for higher mobility support, I am awaiting further diagnoses before I can apply again for further help towards my mobility. It's notoriously a cruel system.  Even this option takes a lot of time, as does saving myself, and I need a scooter to remain mobile and functional  this coming winter, and time is running out.

 I require a class 3 scooter to make my way to appointments and to get groceries, hence the price.  This model will be reliable and simple to insure.
Thanks again, and sorry to the mods if this breaches rules, I'm in a desperate and painful situation and my health is declining as it is. Thankyou for reading. Sorry for errors, my phone screen is quite broken. Keep being awesome y'all!

,"Mother takes in two kittens found in dumpster, major vascular tumor forms on leg, mother pays for the procedure on credit card and sets retirement back.","[https://www.gofundme.com/f/skye039s-surgery-and-hospital-stay?utm\_source=customer&utm\_medium=copy\_link&utm\_campaign=p\_cp+share-sheet](https://www.gofundme.com/f/skye039s-surgery-and-hospital-stay?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet)

All  of the story is in there. He has healed up great and he's back to   being  a cat with the biggest personality ever.  I tried being thorough   as  possible in the story. If anyone wants to see statements from the  vet or discover or whatever, it can be provided. You can talk to my   mother or I on the phone if you would like to. There are pictures in the gofundme of the veterinary clinic bill, and would gladly give credit card statements to anyone who is inquiring.

It's  not an emergency necessarily. It's on a credit card and my mom has a lot of credit, but she's already far behind where she should be   retirement  wise. She is 63, and is going to have to work for something like 4-5  more years before she has a livable wage. There was a  divorce,  I went through some mental health/addiction things and she  helped me with rehab  a few times, which, has finally paid off as I have  over 1 year clean from substances...heroin, methamphetamine,  benzos, alcohol, etc. I use CBD/THC tincture for sleep and that's it.  She has always had my back through everything in life that I struggled  with. If this  bill could just go away, that would be great. I've  started  dumping as much as I can into the house payments with her to  hope she can retire earlier, but we'll have to see.

My  mother works 40+ hours a week at a ""Christian Company"" that works them pretty hard on very hard floors. She used to be able to wear crocs,  which helped, but they banned them and according to her she's been  unable to find shoes that can help. She comes home with swollen ankles  and limps up the stairs, one stair at a time, in order to get upstairs  and crawl into bed to do it again the next day.

It  absolutely breaks my heart when I get home from working at a moving company and think, ""damn I'm sore"" and then she gets home from the same  length shift at hobby lobby and it takes 3 minutes to get up the stairs.  It's destroying her body. If I had only been able to clean up my life a  few years earlier, she might be in a better position for retirement.  I'm doing amazing now, but I never made success and my wages only help  so much. I figure I owe her at least 15k before I am remotely squared up  with her, and I will be paying that and supporting her for the rest of  her life, as she has done for me. I believe with my constant dumping as  much money as possible onto her house mortgage, and being able to pay  down her credit card so she can work on the house as well, it might be  possible to shave a couple years off of working so she is able to  retire.

Also, I know that there  are many people dealing with death, loss, terminal illnesses, etc. I  know my life isn't bad. I love my life. I  would just love to not see my  mom suffer for the next 5 years and be in  tears when she walks. And  good ol' Wisconsin can't pass medicinal the most helpful thing for her  pain.

Any other questions, comments, or ideas of ways I can get help for her/myself, please let me know.

EDIT:  Skye is healthy and active as ever, running around in the house with  the other cats and having the time of his life. I'll upload a couple  videos of him playing at some point. He's been a happy boy since recovery.

HELP PROTECT FIRST RESPONDERS


In today's world, active shooters are becoming more and more prevalent. We rely on our local police departments to respond to these threats and our fire and EMS personnel to care for the wounded.  We know from military combat and domestic shootings that the MAJORITY of deaths can be prevented if life-saving aid can be provided rapidly. However, too often paramedics are unable to get to victims in time due to the hostile nature of the scenario.

We are a group of tactically trained paramedics who support the police SWAT teams in the Metro Boston area and its surrounding communities. We are all trained in providing life-saving care to the sick and wounded in active combat zones. However, as medics we are not law enforcement and get NO funding from federal, state or municipal sources. 

Our current vehicle is a retired ambulance with over 200K miles that has no armor. While we wear ballistic helmets and body armor, we are unarmed and need to rely on our police counterparts for protection. We are seeking to acquire a Lenco armored MedEvac vehicle. This vehicle will be able to provide us and any victims with the protection we need to perform our duty adequately. Unfortunately, this vehicle is way out of our near nonexistent budget and are relying on you and other citizens to help us.

Unfortunately, that diagnosis would start this entire journey.  
   
Gilbert was diagnosed with Stage III Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. After a year’s worth of chemotherapy and also contracting Bleomycin Toxicity from one of chemicals (which damages part of the lungs, giving him a lung capacity of 63%), he beat cancer and has been in remission ever since!  
   
In 2014, my dad got very sick during flu season. We thought it was just a nasty flu but it turned out to be Eosinophilic Pneumonia, which scarred his lungs further; a lung capacity of 46%. He was in the hospital for two weeks and when he was released, he was on 24-hour oxygen.  He wasn’t able to work for six weeks; he couldn’t even go up the stairs of our house. He also had to sleep with an oxygen home concentrator. About a year later, his lung capacity had improved and only used portable oxygen as needed. He was able to get back to living his life as before. 

 In April 2019 however, Gilbert was admitted again into the hospital for another two weeks. He once again developed Eosinophilic Pneumonia. While in the hospital, they did a bronchoscope and found his lungs to be 80% scarred. He was again placed on 24-hour oxygen and sleeping with the oxygen home concentrator. His lung capacity was now at 20%. Once released, he has been seeing a pulmonologist regularly. **The pulmonologist deemed that his condition was deteriorating rapidly and confirmed that he would need a double lung transplant.**   
   
By September 2019, he was readmitted into the hospital and was officially diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis, which he has had for the last three years; it is a progressive fatal lung disease with a life expectancy of 3-5 years. While in the hospital, his pulmonologist moved forward with the evaluation for the double lung transplant. For seven days, my dad underwent several evaluation tests. He will be placed on the waiting list soon, which all of his doctors have said that he could only be waiting for weeks to months. **His transplant surgeon also told us that the transplant is urgent and that he will a high priority on the list.**  
   
My dad is a caring husband, father and grandfather and has always put his family first. His main concern is the financial burden that his procedure will have on us. **His hospital bills and the cost of the anti-rejection medications are astronomical and these are what your generosity and contribution will go towards.** This lung transplant will give him a new lease on life. He will be able to play with his grandchildren, walk his daughters down the aisle and just experience life to the fullest. Through Gilbert’s double lung transplant journey, we will continue to post updates on his recovery.

Link of Kristen Faith: [https://youtu.be/U4EWaKAyOtM](https://youtu.be/U4EWaKAyOtM)

We are in dire need of your help.  This is a life and death situation. My daughter, Kristen, is terminal, and we are raising money to cover the costs of her pending hospital stay and medications.  
Kristen Faith was born June 8 ,1999.  She was a healthy baby girl or, so we thought.  After she came home she was not able to keep her food down.  Her pediatrician determined that she had an acid reflux issue and would need steroids before each feeding to allow her stomach to relax and accept her food. She eventually grew out of that as she got older and we were able to feed her solids. She was always on the small side and continued to always have sinus infections, bronchitis or colds. In 2009 we had an allergy test done that did not really show any allergies that would cause her symptoms, but her doctor was not concerned. In 2012 she started to get worse, and she would continuously cough, had allergies or a cold and was losing weight, and she was bullied in school for always coughing and being small. We fought pneumonia again and again, but she never seemed to get better. Kristen started getting really depressed and losing weight. She was sleeping a lot and still just coughing and always sick. I finally went to another doctor to get a second opinion. We tried different medicines and ran tests, nothing seemed to help her. In early 2014 we finally decided to try sinus surgery to open her sinuses and clean them out so maybe this would help with her chronic coughing. We had hoped that this would solve some of her issues but unfortunately when we went back at 4 weeks she had another sinus infection and still coughing. We were sent to another specialist to run allergy tests.  After all these treatments and surgery, she was still very sickly and losing weight. I was at a loss again not knowing where to go. I knew Kristen was extremely sick again and really could not afford to continue the same treatments we had been doing so I tried a new pediatrician that finally saw the bigger picture. She had pneumonia again, and he told me he knew after one chest X-ray that this child was a walking miracle, and she needed a serious intervention. She had years of damaging scar tissue in her lungs, and he set us up with an amazing pulmonologist the next morning.

 At this point our lives changed.  He told us Kristen may have Cystic Fibrosis and we needed to be in the hospital 3 Hours away immediately to confirm. Kristen was 15 at this time, she was scared, depressed and so sick to the point that she could not even hold her head up. She was at 39% lung function and dehydrated and underweight. They started treatments and tests right away and she spent 6 weeks in the hospital. She had to have blood tests to confirm, and it took several weeks to come back, but in October of 2015, she was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis.

 She started feeling better after being diagnosed correctly and being treated for CF.  She is in counseling and on medication to help with her anxieties and depression and has come a long way.  She has had to be hospitalized several times since being diagnosed to keep her health up. She must take medication and breathing treatments several times a day. Kristen was able to graduate from high school, and was able to start college. She has come a long way in her recovery and I am very proud of her but it is a continuous struggle with medicines and breathing treatments. She has lost so much of her life already to this illness because of not getting the proper treatments needed for her condition, and she has a lot of damage that cannot be reversed. She will still have to be hospitalized every few months to clear her airways and will have to continue all medications and breathing treatments for the rest of her life. We are living each day as a blessing and praying for a cure.

Recently Kristen’s condition has been declining. She spent another week in the hospital and another week on IV antibiotics to try to eliminate a bacteria that is very critical, and possibly terminal for her condition called Burkholderia Cepacia. These bacteria are very serious because it is antibiotic resistant in CF patients and it drastically decreases lung function. We are continuing medications and trying our best, but it does not seem to be going away. She first tested for it in January, and she has been dropping lung function to about 42%, and we are looking at another admission in October for up to 4 weeks. Because of the bacteria she is not a candidate for a double lung transplant for at least 3 years after being  free from the bacteria anymore because of the risks of infecting the new lungs. As of now we are trying to keep her lung function as strong as possible and pray that we can eliminate the infection and the bacteria. Please help me keep my daughter on this Earth as long as we can.  

Burkholderia cepacia is a group of bacteria found naturally in wet soil and decaying plants. In the past, we used to believe that the strains of B. cepacia found in the environment were not the same as those found in people. Recent studies have proved just the opposite, confirming that the bacteria can be spread by contact with infected individuals as well as contaminated surfaces.

B. cepacia rarely affects people with healthy immune systems. B. cepacia infection is not common even in those with cystic fibrosis. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, only three percent of the people with cystic fibrosis tested positive for the bacteria, including those with symptoms and without. The good news is that B. cepacia occurs much less frequently than other organisms responsible for infections in people with CF. The bad news is that, when it does occur, it can often be difficult to treat.  

Once B. cepacia enters the body, there are three possible things that can happen:

It colonizes in the lungs but causes no symptoms or long-term effects.   
It colonizes in the lungs, causing infection and inflammation that slowly deteriorates lung function.  
It spreads (disseminates) throughout the body causing cepacia syndrome, an illness characterized by the rapid deterioration of the lungs. If left untreated, cepacia syndrome can lead to death within weeks."
,Don't know where/if to donate,"Last year I made my first donation to Saint Jude and told myself I would make it a yearly thing to do every birthday and today is the day except now I'm a little uncertain.

I recently heard someone ideas on philanthropy being immoral and they made good arguments. 

I also know that charity is just like investing in that you are putting money to work which is an extremely difficult task to do.

So I'm a little uncertain of where/if to donate. 

I want my dollars to go far and to help someone who could not help themself and that I am not doing any harm by donating.

What are your guys thoughts? Does Saint Jude seem like a good place?"

For the ""challenge"" I will be playing two characters, Valeria and Hector, who normally rely on their guns to deal the most damage, or even dodge. The rules for me are simple:

1. If I accidentally shoot a gun, I have to call the challenge failed and start over.  (symbolizing responsible gun ownership)
2. I have to beat both a ""Survival"" and ""Defense"" mission on the hardest difficulty at or above my level.  
3. If I beat the initial challenge, I have to raise the level.  

How can you help? Either come to the stream and use !GVA in chat to get a donation link, or go directly to http://gvsfoundation.org/donate/ to make a donation. You can also help during the stream by hyping up other viewers and motivating donations."
,Help for a veteran,Is anyone in the north Florida area willing to donate a decent used rv/camper to my wife and myself.  We recently lost our home and are currently staying in a hotel until the money runs out.  I am paid up through Sunday night.  After that it is either on the streets or trying to find somewhere to go.  I just recently started my job so we have an income just not enough to keep paying for a room.  We aren't able to save at the moment for a rental home and there are very few available that we could afford in our area at this time.  A lot hit us at once and we are down but not out.  We will fight to get to some sort of normalcy.  Thanks for any conciderations.
,Greeting Cards Needed for Hospice Patient,"My friend Peter is a dear man who is loved by the many people who call him friend, brother, and even “Aunty”, but he can no longer fight against the pancreatic cancer that is killing him quickly so he is moving in a hospice care center to be kept comfortable for the short time he has left. 

Peter has always been an adventurous, hilarious and sarcastic, endlessly caring soul who has been there for every single person in his gloriously fabulous orbit. Years of listening well and giving good advice got him the nickname “Aunt”. He glitters and shines and enhances the room like a disco ball at the most fun party ever. Today he told us that he is moving on to hospice so they can help make his passing more comfortable. He will leave the world a dull place when he is gone but I want to try and keep what time he has left as fun and cheerful as it can be and to let him know that he has make a mark on the world. Peter has friends all over the country which is great but it means not many visitors and I know he is lonely.

Would you please consider sending a card?

,My husband went to a routine appointment and it ended with him on a ventilator any help would be greatly appreciated,"My husband has had it rough his past 6 months. He went from being able to walk and do whatever he wanted in July to waking up and not being able to walk one day and being bedridden since then. He went to a routine appointment yesterday his vitals started dropping and he ended up in the emergency room at John Hopkins intubated and on a ventilator. I'm trying to raise as much money as I can because I would like to stay with him and I'm not sure exactly how long he's going to be here. If something happened and he  passes if I go home I could never live with myself. Anything would be greatly appreciated he's only 34 years old. They found a couple pulmonary embolisms.

,A Mother who remains positive in need of a KIDNEY,"Dear Family and Friends,
 
Some of you may or may not know that I have been suffering from kidney disease. Over time, my illness has progressively gotten worse, causing my kidneys to work harder to keep me alive.
I am currently doing home hemodialysis so I can have more quality time with my two boys.My treatments consist of 4 treatments a week for 3 hours, including setting up the machines.  Having a transplant would offer me so much more freedom and the ability to live a longer, healthier life. The operation would also give me more time and energy to enjoy fun activities with my friends, kids, and family. I am the middle child; my mother was a single parent who just happened to be one of the first female firefighters in New York City. I have two brothers, my oldest brother.
 
Finding a kidney has not been an easy process for me. Even with the help of my family and friends, this has been a long, hard, and expensive procedure. Just ask the 100,000 + people currently on the waiting list for a deceased donor kidney.  Unfortunately, time is not on my side. There are some days when I feel well enough to get out of bed and make sure that my boys get off to school in the morning.  Other days, it is a struggle to help them complete their homework as well as cooking dinner and getting them ready for bed at night. And days where I don't even have the energy to get out of bed myself, too weak to take care of myself or my sons. I have been extremely fortunate to have the support of my mother and other family members. However, my health issue is very disheartening and emotional, which affects my entire family.  
I will appreciate any support.  I would only want a donor that does not feel forced or pressured in any way into donating to me. I understand that this is an extremely personal decision and one that takes much thought as well as your family's consideration. If this is not for you, that is okay, and it will not affect our relationship. As I said before, I am doing this with the hope that it may yield a positive result for me. Thanks for taking the time to read this and your consideration!

,Please donate to help children with autism around the globe!," The Global Autism Project is a certified non-profit organization (501c3) that funds training initiatives for parents of and teachers who work with children with autism in countries with very few resources for autism. They provide clinical and organizational support to schools and clinics in communities where children are not allowed to attend school, are frequent targets of abuse, and where families do not know how to help their child because there are no professionals to guide them. We believe 75% of the world's population that lives with autism currently lives in countries where there are very few resources to care for these individuals. Autism knows no borders.

I have pledged to raise $5000 for this organization as well as volunteer to train local staff at a clinic in Guyaquil Ecuador. This fundraiser does not pay for my trip to Ecuador, it goes straight to [http://globalautismproject.org/](http://globalautismproject.org/) . Please consider donating. I have raised $3900 so far for this truly amazing cause.

,"Please help support my mother, a saint, and a widow as of this morning.","My father, Ed, died this morning. He had been sick for some time. I could tell you all about him, but my sister has already wrote a touching and wonderful obituary [here](https://www.petitroan.com/notices/Edward-Johnson?fbclid=IwAR0vQWqCI3wTPkHKHHePVlolTeP65O58bpgdTO_l1JjlcASKBD9vbmWG3GQ). I encourage you to read it. 

He was diagnosed with kidney cancer last summer and quickly underwent surgery to remove the tumor, which had also worked it's way up to his heart. It looked like he was okay, though it was very close. A few months later though he started feeling sick again and scans showed that the cancer had spread to his spine, and his lungs. He tried many different treatments, but none of them worked, and in August of this year he started hospice at home. 

Starting in July, my mother, who is the most giving soul I have ever known, had to stop working to care for her dying husband. At the same time she also had to continue the full time job of caring for my adult brother who has Down-Syndrome. She was running herself ragged and had many expenses and no income. Fortunately after organizing a GoFundMe campaign and sharing it on Facebook, we were able to raise $3000 to help her. We projected that would give her enough of a cushion to not have to work for 3 months. Well the 3 months are up, and her husband is now dead. But there are still many expenses ahead and she is still struggling. 

My mother has made her whole life about helping others. In high school she got certified to be a nursing assistant and started working in nursing homes, being an outspoken advocate for the residents care. She then left the workforce some time after giving birth to my younger brother, who has Down-Syndrome. The Lord blessed her with two more children after that, for a total of seven, any which of whom she would walk through Hell for. When she returned to the workforce she became an educational aide, specializing in assisting autistic children. Because she was so outspoken about the children's care (she had no patience for anyone that didn't do the best they could in caring for the needy, and didn't know how to be politically correct in sharing her views), she parted ways with the school. She now works at a group home for children with emotional and developmental issues. This woman is a saint, and is in dire need. Please help me in supporting her and showing her that she is loved and cared for, even by strangers. 

Any amount, even $1, helps. God bless all of you for all the help you give.

,Please help a family with burial costs for a loving grandmother that was taken away too soon by a violent domestic incident.,"Hello, I am posting here today to ask for help regarding a lovely woman, grandmother, and family matriarch named Terri-Lynn who was murdered recently.

Terri-Lynn, a woman who had much to live for was ripped away from her family and friends due to horrific circumstances relating to domestic assault and abuse.  She leaves behind many friends, associates, and an adoring family that cared for her greatly.

Terri-Lynn had a heart of gold and was the loyal backbone of a close-knit community, she was always concerned with the well-being of everyone around her and would stand up for the rights of others with a ferocious tenacity, defiant against injustice.  Terri-Lynn will always be remembered as a cheerfully determined woman who welcomed anybody and everyone with open arms and compassion.

The family is running a GoFundMe campaign to help with burial and service costs, any help would be greatly appreciated.

We are already several thousand dollars out of pocket even with insurance, we don't have anything left, and are just hoping for a bit of help to make sure she can continue to get care.

Our goal is to raise $3000 for Cincinnati Children's Hospital by November 2nd! We are currently almost halfway there. We're donating to Cincinnati Children's because each of us have been personally helped in the past as sick kids.

I myself suffered terribly from ear infections as a kid, and the staff took great care of me during treatment and surgery and not only helped me heal but made me feel as safe and comfortable as possible while I did so.

To raise money, we're playing games and completing challenges as suggested by the viewers of our 24 hour charity livestream on November second. Each of us has personal fundraising goals that we're trying to meet. I am going to shave my head if I raise $1k, my friend Hannah (who hates horror) is playing RE7 in VR is she raises $500 etc.

I'm also running raffles! I've been involved in the transformers collector fandom for a while now and I'm raffling off all sorts of prizes and collectibles for people who enter it!

,Saddened by homeless in London - How best to help. Any advice is welcome!,"Hey Everyone. 

Homelessness in London, a city of immense wealth, always seemed to me like an disgraceful state of affairs. The fact that there are so many people sleeping rough, and receiving little help, and sympathy for that matter, always seemed plainly wrong. I know there are many complex reasons a person ends up on the sleeping rough, but i'd like to be able to help in someway. 

My  favorite thing to do is to ride my bike at night, and when i do, i see little tent villages, huddled out of sight. It makes me so sad. 

I want to do something, even if its small and makes little difference, as opposed to just seeing it and feeling bad but doing nothing. 

I'd love peoples advice on this. I want to, when i can, fill a backpack with sandwiches and drop them off to those people that i can find and are hungry. I think i could fit 30 sandwiches in my bag. However, i've read in various places that in fact food isn't necessarily what is needed while sleeping rough.  Can anyone give me advice here, perhaps from experience. I'm open to ideas, and expertise. 

Thank  you for reading this."

,Tech for Impact,"**Digital technology is rising in today's world. With advanced technological developments and social outreach gaining momentum every second, the future looks bright and promising. Over the last few years, the internet has been an integral part of reaching out to the world.**

The Internet is helping many individuals and organizations around the world to connect and support each other. Many philanthropists and social activists are now working on **Appropriate Technology.** 

Appropriate Technology helps in creating a customized solution for NGOs and other social groups. Many organizations are now working on appropriate technology to make a difference in today's society. Unknown to us, many people suffer from psychological and health disorders. Not only that, many underprivileged kids and adults don't have the minimum utilities to sustain a decent lifestyle. 

Even though our Government is trying their utmost to eradicate poverty and malnourishment, at the ground level many people are suffering and can’t avail basic amenities. With the help of multiple NGOs, the govt is now able to track the resources that are required for providing people with a better lifestyle and facilities. Using suitable technology, many apps have been created by individuals and organizations to create an impact and help the underprivileged. 

According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/features/factfiles/disability/en/), people with disabilities are among the most marginalized groups in the world. The concept of Appropriate Technology is to bring in awareness for people out there who wish to help them with suitable tools. This will give them a huge chance as well as provide a platform to work on equal grounds with everyone around them. 

With this in mind, many top companies have initiated various CSR programs to support and fund tech for impact initiatives around the world. One such platform is the Vodafone CSR Initiative - [Social App Hub](https://www.socialapphub.com/) where users can find different apps in Education, Safety, Health, etc. published by the people - for the people to support our world. There are also inspiring case studies and interviews that help users see the good of the world and motivate them to take steps to better their surroundings.   

This open platform showcases all the different types of apps that have been built to do social good for people using high-end technologies. Based on their type, relevance and impact, we add and categorize all the apps present on the website. Also, many inspiring foundations and personalities have been interviewed and their visions have been shared as stories. 

If you know anyone or can help anyone with our initiative -  Please visit our website [https://www.socialapphub.com/](https://www.socialapphub.com/) to make a difference."
,We can't make rent this month.,"I posted here a little while ago about some car trouble, but this need supercedes that one. I teach in one of the poorest areas in the US and, even as a full time teacher, depend on government assistance to feed my four kids and my wife and I, as well as pay our bills. This month there was a crazy hiccup in the government regarding recertifications and money didn't come through for us, so we wound up paying for a utility bill that was supposed to be covered by the HEAP, while also having to cover all groceries as SNAP got paused until next month. All that to say, we're stuck choosing to either feed the family or pay our rent of $700. If anyone would feel like donating even a little so we can offset some of the rent and buy groceries, that would be amazing. Here's the GoFundMe: https://www.gofundme.com/1s90psbbpc

This is a link to my campaign I just Put on Facebook if anyone could help me raise the 140$ that would change my life.

https://www.facebook.com/donate/3022212221129319/?fundraiser_source=external_url

I’ll put some extra details here on Reddit that I was a little embarrassed to share on Facebook. Like that I have been taking care of my alcoholic sister for years now. It’s put a huge strain on my mental health. She isn’t even appreciative as she always tells me something I’m doing wrong or that I should give her more money. Other family put a huge strain on me too wrecking several cars (including my paid off versa) and leaving me struggling to make it to work and still support them. I have honestly wrestled with suicide several time through this struggle. It’s so hard to work everyday from sun up to till sun down and have less than nothing to show for it. Then to cap it all off I was recently fired from my job because my work declined most likely due to the above sob story. I was devastated. I wasn’t making much at my last job but I had put in the time and the promise of better pay was always around the corner. So I worked 2 years for nothing.

But that sob story didn’t make me create a fundraiser the hope for a better future did. After getting fired I rushed to find a new job and I did. I got a sales job that pays several dollars an hour more then my last job and has way more stability. I want everything to work out so bad but my unexpected job change has come at the worst time. I’m already maxed out. I’ve asked everyone for money and I need 140$ to get me to that first paycheck and that is with limited food and gas still being a problem. Thanks for taking the time to read this. If anyone wants to know more about my situation feel free to ask. There is even more sob story I didn’t get to like the death of the only man that really believed in me. I’m really just hoping one good soul is out there to help me out."

My friends and I have donated in the past, but this year we wanted to start our own Extra Life campaign! Our goal is to raise $3000 for Cincinnati Children's Hospital by November 2nd! We are currently almost halfway there. We're donating to Cincinnati Children's because each of us have been personally helped in the past as sick kids.

&#x200B;

I myself suffered terribly from ear infections as a kid, and the staff took great care of me during treatment and surgery and not only helped me heal but made me feel as safe and comfortable as possible while I did so.

To raise money, we're playing games and completing challenges as suggested by the viewers of our 24 hour charity livestream on November second. Each of us has personal fundraising goals that we're trying to meet. I am going to shave my head if I raise $1k, my friend Hannah (who hates horror) is playing RE7 in VR is she raises $500 etc.

&#x200B;

I'm also running raffles! I've been involved in the  transformers collector fandom for a while now and I'm raffling off all sorts of prizes and collectibles for people who enter it!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The woman you see before you, Pam, is my Mother-In-Law, but honestly she’s more like the mom I never had. She is the sweetest, most patient and loving woman you will ever meet. You can’t help but find hope when she talks to you about how her prayers for her friends and families are being answered and getting good reports. She’s a beautifully inspiring floral arranger and crowned Official Craft Queen by all who know her. She is a loving, dedicated and selfless wife and mother of nearly 40 years and grandmother of a beautiful 3 year old. (My daughter)

Pam is one of the strongest women you will ever meet, though you might not guess it when you look at her. She has mild cerebral palsy as well as a few other health issues that severely limit her mobility and have been instrumental in isolating her and forcing her to rely on others for assistance. Pam wears a leg brace and uses a walker to help her maintain balance and stability while on the go. She really struggles with normal size steps so her husband had actually built her a half-step stair case into their house at one point. 

Her husband was active in their church for many years, preaching, playing the drums and helping in other yearly events at the church. He was involved with a small Christian band made up of members of the local community who played all over the local region. 

Their only son is my husband of 7 years. Along with our daughter, the 3 of us have found ourselves living with my in-laws due to some unexpected life changes. I am currently unable to work at the moment due to severe CPTSD, so we are already catching our breath. 

About 3 weeks ago (middle of September) my MIL had asked her husband if they could do something after church that Sunday. FIL suggested they go for a drive on some back roads. MIL happily agreed. It had been a while since they’d spent some good quality time alone together. 

Unfortunately, once they began their drive, FIL began casually talking about how he hadn’t been happy in a long time. He started talking about he hadn’t loved her for years. He talked about how he knew it was a mistake to marry her when he did, but he did it to get away from his own abusive mother. After a while he decided it was the right thing to do to stay..so out of obligation he stayed, but he didn’t love her as his wife, and he has my husband is wondering if it was the same for him as his son. 

FIL just kind of started rambling... and over the last few weeks there were many things that he communicated to her. He confessed to being unfaithful 20 years ago with a close family friend. He said she deserves better. He said she was a good wife. He said they could be friends still. He said they could maybe DATE(?!) in the future. He also told her she needs to get over him, emotionally. 
 
FIL casually mentioned it to my husband in passing the next day at work. Pretty much to the extent of, “your mother and I are getting a divorce so, I’m not kicking you out, but you guys need to get a place soon.” 

The man, from all appearances, who loves her and her son, and now daughter-in-law and granddaughter, and has worked himself tirelessly ill for the betterment of “the family”...no matter the cost... and sometimes it was at the cost of emotional connection and relational investment with his wife and son (he has said all these things to me personally over the last few years. His words, not mine). All the while my MIL and now husband is living in a hellish nightmare, she remained faithful to him. She loved him. She supported him and did not spread an ill word about him. 

She never wanted to betray the man she loved and devoted her life to and made a family with. 

He barely took care of her basic every day and special needs. In the new house he is renting, she has been having to bathe in the sink because she doesn’t have the proper handles to safely get into the tub. SHE DIDNT TELL ME FOR 3 MONTHS. FIL refused to do anything to allow her to just take a shower in their new home. (We have ordered the necessary attachments for the tub and currently waiting for them to arrive.)

Now FIL wants her gone. But not just her, all of us. See, we are currently finding ourselves all living under one roof...he refuses to leave. While we understand there may be things we can do to force our hand, we would prefer to just peacefully go without any more heartache or trauma brought onto ourselves. The pain has been dealt...we just want it to stop. 

My husband, Mother-In-Law and I have decided that this pain and hurt stops with us and my daughter. We have decided to join together as a household, as a family, to take care of each other and to help each other heal and grieve and mourn this world shattering news. We will be starting over with love and care for each other, but we need some help getting started. 

My MIL obviously had no idea so its not like she had herself a hefty “after Husband dumps me” fund set aside. My husband was working for his dad up til recently due to the stress-fullness of the situation. With me unable to work, now we have no income. 

We have a plan to move to a nearby town that’s a bit larger than where we are currently to allow us to find decent, handicap accessible housing without too much difficulty in finding work quickly, especially with holidays coming up. People will be hiring and we can catch our bearings a bit. 

We just need to get out and into our own place. We are humbly asking for your help. Even just a little bit helps. If everyone who saw this gave $5 it would only take 800 people to give $5 and we’d have our goal of $4,000. 

Please share this with as many people as possible. Help me and my husband give this incredible woman the life she deserves by giving us a boost to get started. We love you momma. We are going to be ok. ❤️"

Now, the small town of Ola, AR, where NovaStar is located, has decided to shut down the Rescue. They are choosing to start enforcing an old law, which limits the number of dogs per household to 4 adult dogs. This law has never been enforced before. Yet they decided to start with a nonprofit rescue. Even though Ola, AR has NO animal shelter, NO animal control personnel and has, in the past, not only brought stray dogs to NovaStar but has also called NovaStar to come and pick up dogs in need. The city council has, without discussion or warning, given NovaStar 30 days to get into compliance with the 4 dog rule.  They have offered no options for exemption and no options for the strays wandering the streets of Ola.

,Gt Ormond Street Children's Hospital - Race for Life 11/10/2019 - Hyde Park London,"Gt Ormond Street Children's Hospital is a great place to have a really horrible time, is what one amazing doctor once said to us when talking about Teddy’s time there.

Our family will be running the RBC Race for the Kids 2019 in Hyde Park in London on 12th October, and we would be very grateful for any support in fundraising for the Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Teddy was antenatally diagnosed with a complex heart condition with a very guarded prognosis at the anomaly scan at 20 weeks pregnant. Since June 2017, GOSH and their staff have played an incredible role in our family life. 

To date, Teddy has had countless check ups with GOSH, some minor interventions and two life saving open heart surgeries, and in that time we have gained an insight into the work this wonderful children’s hospital do for their patients and their families. This hospital has given Teddy, and us,  a brand new hope and a new lease of life, whilst providing him with the state of the art medical care and the practical, moral and emotional support for the family to get us all through. From the acts of kindness, through putting us up in free family accommodation on site, to providing highly specialised care for Teddy, without the hospital our family would not be what it is today.  


Teddy has been through more in his young life than most will be in a lifetime. He is doing really well now and loving living a full and happy life, with virtually no restrictions. There is still some uncertainty in his future as he will require more open heart surgeries and interventions as he gets older but there is no better place than GOSH to trust with his case. 

We would be really grateful if you could help us give something back to the GOSH family, and would appreciate any and all donations. \*Our current target of £300 is the equivalent of the cost of providing the family of a seriously ill child with on site accommodation for a week, something that can make a tremendous difference to the patients and their recovery. \*we’ve got some incredible supporters, whose generous support to this wonderful charity has exceeded our wildest expectations! We’ve decided to see if we can raise £800 before the run.

,World Scholars Cup: Tournament of Champions at Yale University,"Hello all,

Myself and 3 other students have taken part in a competition known as the World Scholars Cup in which it aims unite people from all over the world through the many event held within the competition. The competition covers six areas of study within a syllabus unique to each year, this year being a ‘World on the Margains’ which seeks to further make us aware of the marginalisation that people face all over the world. These six areas are: literature, the arts, science, social studies, history and a special area unique to theme of the syllabus. The competition itself is split into 3 rounds. The first round is a regional round held within a close by area in your city. The next round after that is a global round which requires you to qualify in the previous round to attend. This round is more challenging than the previous and six are held all around the world. The next round after this is the Tournament of Champions which is held within the Yale University and is the most elite level to compete at in the World Scholars Cup. This round is where the best of the best compete towards earning a scholarship for the Yale University. This final round offers students insight as to what it is like to attend Yale through first hand experience such as getting to know the students there and hearing from professors there. Students also are told how they are able to use their experience at this final round within Yale to potentially get a position there as a student.

Myself and the other students wishing to attend this event would see it as a great experience to enhance our learning and interconnectedness with those from countries all over the world. We are looking to raise $20,000 AUD to cover costs of the trip for things such as flights, accomodation, transport, etc. We would very much appreciate if you could donate any amount of money as a little goes a long way. If you are unable to donate we would be very appreciative if you are able to share this so that others may see this. Thank you!

,My Friend's Got a Tumor,"Hello! My best friend in the whole world, who works hard as heck as a nanny while also trying to break into the music scene in Austin, TX has had a lipoma on her back for about four years. It has also messed with her shoulder motion, made laying down and sleeping difficult and sometimes painful, and limited her ability to exercise, but recently it’s been getting worse.   It’s started to grow more rapidly and has become warm to the touch, which is always worrying with cancer (even benign cancer). She doesn’t have insurance, and makes slightly too much money a year to qualify for some of the financial assistance programs that help with insurance.   Because she is unfunded, the hospital is requiring she pay for the surgery in full before the operation. It’s going to cost slightly less than $3700, which she can’t afford out of pocket on her own. It’s taken a long time navigating the health care system to even arrive at this price and operation date (Nov 7th) and it would be terrible to not be able to go through with it because she can’t afford it.   The tumor will never go away on its own, and at this point the best case scenario is it stops growing or slows down. The worst case is that it converts to a malignant cancer (like liposarcoma). Please, please help us get it out of her before that can happen.  She’s set up a GoFundMe, which I’ve linked below.

,Help me smile again.,"Hey guys,

I know my struggle won't seem important to most people but I'm desperate and don't know where else to turn.

I'm currently working a minimum wage job and studying at Tafe (kind of like the Australian version of community college). I'm studying bookkeeping and accounting in the hopes that I can turn my life around and find a better job and become more financially stable and create a better life for myself. I saved for years to be able to afford the fees and the books and I'm currently getting by on eating instant noodles and buttered bread each day.

Anyway, I've struggled with depression, anxiety and self esteem issues since I was a teenager, except that now, I really have something to be ashamed of.

My teeth are so crowded and have shifted so much in my mouth that my front top tooth has protruded so far out that it's hanging in there by a thread. Not only is it hideous, it's loose and will eventually fall out. It's hard to explain just how bad it looks/feels.


I'm not a vain person. I just wish I knew how it felt to laugh at a joke or smile at someone without consciously checking myself every time. I try to talk without opening my mouth very much and I'm tired of people staring when I do open my mouth because it looks like I have a tooth just dangling there.

Dental work is extremely expensive in Australia. It would cost around $5000-$8000 for an implant (including extraction) and with the cost of my school fees and books, I just can't find any way to afford this.

I know that my struggle isn't as serious as others, but I appreciate you taking the time to read my story, even if you don't donate.

,I fight to end Alzheimer's for my amazing father," My dad was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's when I was 18. I barely knew what Alzheimer's was at the time and the horrors of the disease have only shocked me more for the past 6 years.

I always loved my dad and we were very close. My admiration for him really skyrocketed within the first few years of his disease. He had very minimal symptoms at the time and put all his energy into fighting Alzheimer's disease. He won awards for his work with Alzheimer's New Jersey, he gave speeches, he went on podcasts. It was amazing to watch someone with such a horrible disease, work to fight it. He would always say, ""I know I won't be cured, but its for the future generations to have a chance."" Unfortunately the disease at this point is very advanced and there isn't much of my dad left anymore, but I continue to fight on for him.

Together, we can end Alzheimer's disease. Please make a donation to advance the care, support and research efforts of the Alzheimer's Association. 

Thank you for joining the fight against Alzheimer's!

,"Looking for help getting exposure for my GoFundMe. I hate begging, but I desperately need assistance with my upcoming medical bills."," 

Like the title says, I am in the unfortunate position where I need to beg strangers online to help with my medical bills. I'm trying to figure out how to get more exposure for my cause without simply spamming my Facebook with requests and offending my friends.

The short version of my story is that I struggled with binge-eating for the first 22 years of my life. I was 400 pounds. Two different times. I've been left with lots of excess skin, and the only path forward for me, physically and mentally, is skin removal surgery. I've tried to be strong mentally and adjust to having skin hanging off of me. But I really can't handle it anymore.

I lost 200 pounds, and I've maintained that for 8 years. I've changed my relationship with food and exercise. I try to be healthy and have more functional coping mechanisms rather than binge eating (or anorexia, which I've also dealt with).

The total cost of surgery is going to be approximately $55,000 USD. None is covered by insurance.

I need to go back to school and get a master's degree. And buy a car so I could get a better job. But I'm looking at taking out a personal loan this year to pay for my surgery. Given the interest rates I've been offered, if I have to take out a loan that big, it's going to cost about $70k USD after interest, by the time I pay this off. I will NEVER be able to move forward in my life paying off this much debt.

I'm sorry to come here and ask for money. But I don't know what else to do. I just would like to have my story more visible in the hopes that maybe a few people would feel generous. Anything helps at this point, I'm going to be financially ruined. Helping my cause be shared around the internet more would be just as valuable at this point than a donation.

,Please donate to the Global Autism Project to provide support to children with autism in developing countries!," The Global Autism Project is a certified non-profit organization (501c3) that funds training initiatives for parents of and teachers who work with children with autism in countries with very few resources for autism. They provide clinical and organizational support to schools and clinics in communities where children are not allowed to attend school, are frequent targets of abuse, and where families do not know how to help their child because there are no professionals to guide them. We believe 75% of the world's population that lives with autism currently lives in countries where there are very few resources to care for these individuals. Autism knows no borders.

,Help 14-yr-old with special needs get spinal surgery,"Hi everyone, this is for my nephew Sam. He has a rare genetic condition called Prader-Willi syndrome. When he was born, the doctors gave him 2 years to live. He proved them wrong and turned 14 this June. It's been a struggle for him since day one, though. A vivacious kid with a teenager's personality, he can't really speak or stand/walk on his own, and he needs spinal surgery as soon as possible because of the severity of his scoliosis, which is starting to squeeze vital organs. The procedure isn't available in our country (Philippines), so he has to have it done in Spain (more affordable than the US!).

As you can imagine, the cost is astronomical - 80k euro for the medical fees alone. We're doing all we can to help Sam get the medical attention he needs, and if you can help in any way, we'd be filled with gratitude.

Learn more about Sam, share his story, and donate if you can via this link: [https://gogetfunding.com/i-got-sams-back-sams-spinal-surgery-fundraiser/](https://gogetfunding.com/i-got-sams-back-sams-spinal-surgery-fundraiser/).

,"Please help save my daughter, Kristen- Jody Merrit, Kristen's Dad","We are in dire need of your help.  This is a life and death situation. My daughter, Kristen, is terminal, and we are raising money to cover the costs of her pending hospital stay and medications.  


Kristen Faith was born June 8 ,1999.  She was a healthy baby girl or, so we thought.  After she came home she was not able to keep her food down.  Her pediatrician determined that she had an acid reflux issue and would need steroids before each feeding to allow her stomach to relax and accept her food. She eventually grew out of that as she got older and we were able to feed her solids. She was always on the small side and continued to always have sinus infections, bronchitis or colds. In 2009 we had an allergy test done that did not really show any allergies that would cause her symptoms, but her doctor was not concerned. In 2012 she started to get worse, and she would continuously cough, had allergies or a cold and was losing weight, and she was bullied in school for always coughing and being small. We fought pneumonia again and again, but she never seemed to get better. Kristen started getting really depressed and losing weight. She was sleeping a lot and still just coughing and always sick. I finally went to another doctor to get a second opinion. We tried different medicines and ran tests, nothing seemed to help her. In early 2014 we finally decided to try sinus surgery to open her sinuses and clean them out so maybe this would help with her chronic coughing. We had hoped that this would solve some of her issues but unfortunately when we went back at 4 weeks she had another sinus infection and still coughing. We were sent to another specialist to run allergy tests.  After all these treatments and surgery, she was still very sickly and losing weight. I was at a loss again not knowing where to go. I knew Kristen was extremely sick again and really could not afford to continue the same treatments we had been doing so I tried a new pediatrician that finally saw the bigger picture. She had pneumonia again, and he told me he knew after one chest X-ray that this child was a walking miracle, and she needed a serious intervention. She had years of damaging scar tissue in her lungs, and he set us up with an amazing pulmonologist the next morning.  


 At this point our lives changed.  He told us Kristen may have Cystic Fibrosis and we needed to be in the hospital 3 Hours away immediately to confirm. Kristen was 15 at this time, she was scared, depressed and so sick to the point that she could not even hold her head up. She was at 39% lung function and dehydrated and underweight. They started treatments and tests right away and she spent 6 weeks in the hospital. She had to have blood tests to confirm, and it took several weeks to come back, but in October of 2015, she was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis.  


 She started feeling better after being diagnosed correctly and being treated for CF.  She is in counseling and on medication to help with her anxieties and depression and has come a long way.  She has had to be hospitalized several times since being diagnosed to keep her health up. She must take medication and breathing treatments several times a day. Kristen was able to graduate from high school, and was able to start college. She has come a long way in her recovery and I am very proud of her but it is a continuous struggle with medicines and breathing treatments. She has lost so much of her life already to this illness because of not getting the proper treatments needed for her condition, and she has a lot of damage that cannot be reversed. She will still have to be hospitalized every few months to clear her airways and will have to continue all medications and breathing treatments for the rest of her life. We are living each day as a blessing and praying for a cure.  


Recently Kristen’s condition has been declining. She spent another week in the hospital and another week on IV antibiotics to try to eliminate a bacteria that is very critical, and possibly terminal for her condition called Burkholderia Cepacia. These bacteria are very serious because it is antibiotic resistant in CF patients and it drastically decreases lung function. We are continuing medications and trying our best, but it does not seem to be going away. She first tested for it in January, and she has been dropping lung function to about 42%, and we are looking at another admission in October for up to 4 weeks. Because of the bacteria she is not a candidate for a double lung transplant for at least 3 years after being  free from the bacteria anymore because of the risks of infecting the new lungs. As of now we are trying to keep her lung function as strong as possible and pray that we can eliminate the infection and the bacteria. Please help me keep my daughter on this Earth as long as we can.    


Burkholderia cepacia is a group of bacteria found naturally in wet soil and decaying plants. In the past, we used to believe that the strains of B. cepacia found in the environment were not the same as those found in people. Recent studies have proved just the opposite, confirming that the bacteria can be spread by contact with infected individuals as well as contaminated surfaces.  


B. cepacia rarely affects people with healthy immune systems. B. cepacia infection is not common even in those with cystic fibrosis. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, only three percent of the people with cystic fibrosis tested positive for the bacteria, including those with symptoms and without. The good news is that B. cepacia occurs much less frequently than other organisms responsible for infections in people with CF. The bad news is that, when it does occur, it can often be difficult to treat.    


Once B. cepacia enters the body, there are three possible things that can happen:  


It colonizes in the lungs but causes no symptoms or long-term effects.   
It colonizes in the lungs, causing infection and inflammation that slowly deteriorates lung function.  
It spreads (disseminates) throughout the body causing cepacia syndrome, an illness characterized by the rapid deterioration of the lungs. If left untreated, cepacia syndrome can lead to death within weeks.

My team and I will be riding on October 10th at Toronto (Yonge & Dundas Square) at 11 am. It's basically a high-energy stationary cycling event taking place in more than 20 cities across Canada, challenging Canadians to raise funds and go further to defeat diabetes.

Last year the same event raised $3.4 Mill to fund research seeking a cure for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).

JDRF who has organised this event is  the leading global organization funding T1D research. You can find information about it here -  [https://www.jdrf.ca/](https://www.jdrf.ca/)

It's my first time fundraising for anything let alone at such a large event and i admit that I was previously ignorant about T1D.  But I read about how type 1 Diabetes is a disease which affects children. My parents and grand parents have what I have learnt is type 2 Diabetes, so I have witnessed the tremendous harm this disease does and it was shocking to find out that children can get the type 1 form of Diabetes.

Being my first time, I set a modest fundraising target of $150. But i really do want to make a difference.

This is a link to my fundraising page -  [https://jdrf.akaraisin.com/RevolutionRide2019/MustBeatDiabetes](https://jdrf.akaraisin.com/RevolutionRide2019/MustBeatDiabetes)

To be honest most of my friends and relatives seem to be unaware about T1D and I am finding it difficult to find people willing to donate. I found this forum while searching for ways in which I could reach out to people and was hoping that members here would be willing to make a contribution however small.

I am posting some links below for anyone who would like to know more about this event, how your money is used and about JDRF.

The FAQ link also provides information on Tax Receipts issued for donations

,"My Father Has Cancer, and I Need Your Help","Good afternoon!

I hope you are having a great start to your week. 

A couple of years ago, my father was diagnosed with stage 3 lymphoma. The doctor said that the disease would eventually take him from us. However, the doctor also said that the disease is unpredictable, and it could be 5 years or 15 years before it that happens.

As such, I have been raising funds for The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society in an effort to help to find a cure for my dad’s illness before it’s too late. I figured that every dollar I help to raise could actually save my dad. And even if this horrible cancer does take my father before a cure is found, then this effort to raise money will be for the person next to me who is fighting the ultimate fight of their lives. 

I have a GoFundMe for the cause: [https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-leukemia-amp-lymphoma-society-fundraiser?rcid=r01-156985303245-3c2ed20955034fa8&pc=ot\_co\_campmgmt\_w](https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-leukemia-amp-lymphoma-society-fundraiser?rcid=r01-156985303245-3c2ed20955034fa8&pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w)

We are already several thousand dollars out of pocket even with insurance, we don't have anything left, and are just hoping for a bit of help to make sure she can continue to get care.

Please, if you can help, I would greatly appreciate it. She means absolutely everything to us; she is such a sweet, bright, adorable little thing, and we don't want to have to cancel appointments or have her go without care just because it's so ridiculously expensive and we only have so much. We just have no more money, literally, this has totally drained us. We don't need much, but it's more than what we have. Thank you to anyone who reads this. And if you are not able to contribute (which I fully understand, being in this situation right now), maybe you could share this so that somebody out there, to whom this amount of money isn't so much, might see it?

,RPCV looking to help neighbor in Cameroonian Village go to University,"Hello Everyone! 

This page has been made for a reason very close to my heart. A few months ago I finished my Peace Corps service in Cameroon (West Africa). I was the first volunteer to ever live in the village of Banza in the West Region. I spent two wonderful years there and made so many friends and wonderful connections. People think that volunteering is about giving to a community but, I truly recieved more than I was ever able to give.  

While I was in village I made a connection with Basil. He and I quickly bonded over art, he participated in many activities I had in school and we quickly became friends.

He started asking me to borrow my art supplies because he had very little and would update me on every single image he drew with the supplies. I was shocked by how amazing he was without ever taking a single class. He is a tremendous natural talent with an incredible heart that only adds to his character. No matter what I needed help with, he was there every moment. Respectful, responsible and mature. 

Cameroon doesn't have many opportunities for young people therefore, being supported to follow your passions or getting a part time job like we can in the US isn't really prioritized or available. Many kids sell food items on the street for their families, sell the vegetables they grew and cultivated in their fields and many can barely afford to pay for school. Basil has a family who could help him pay for the small highschool tuition (about $40 a year) from their farm's income but affording to go to college is a huge financial barrier that is very unlikely for him and his family to overcome without help. 

Basil is 18 and wants to study art at the University of Yaounde (the capital of Cameroon) this upcoming school year, his first year as a university student. He wants to continue exploring and perfecting his talents so that he can continue to become a wonderful artist and create a business for himself. Being able to go to a school like this would give him the tools and the connections to follow his dreams and we have the chance to be a part of that. 

If I could pay for it all on my own I would in a heartbeat but, unfortunately I financially can't. I know many of you followed my journey through the Peace Corps and many said that they wished they could do something to help our global citizens. This is a chance to do that.

His tutiton is about $2,000. He would also have to pay for school supplies therefore I think that $500 would suffice for school supplies, buy some food and help him find a place for a few months until he can find a way to gain some income on his own. Making the crowdfund amount $2,500. 

His facebook art page is

,Need some help finalizing payment on my permanent resident visa!,"In March, I moved to Australia from America to be with my fiancee of  three years after I spent a year saving and planning for the move on a temporary visa.

,"Please, help a single pet-dad find a new temporary home until he can find work","Hey everyone. My name is Daed, and I'm a 24-year-old trans man living in Las Vegas. I moved out here in November of 2018 with my girlfriend, moving 2000 miles across the country. It was an impulsive decision, yes, but one that we thought we could make work.

However, a few weeks ago, my girlfriend was forced to move out of our apartment due to a family emergency. She still lives close by, but as we've both been having trouble finding work since we arrived (we've had jobs since we arrived, we just have had circumstances beyond our control get in the way) and we're both trying to pay our own rent, things have been complicated. While I hate asking for help, I'm in kind of a pickle here. I had trouble paying rent this week, so I moved me and my kids (the cat and dog, who very much are my kids) to a cheap, pet-friendly motel temporarily and now I'm trying to figure out how to get another place until I can find work.

I've estimated about two weeks, given that I've been putting in applications left and right, and I have an appointment tomorrow morning to go to the DMV and try and get a state ID and plan to spend Tuesday trying to get the licensing I need to work food service in my state. I'll likely live in an extended stay apartment, and rent there is about $220 for move-in. On top of that, I'm trying to pay that, my phone bill, and buy some cheap groceries for myself and my pets. I have my cat and a dog that we got before my girlfriend moved out, and I'm the sole breadwinner for the three of us for the time being.

I've estimated about $750 for all of this, just to be safe. It's all going to bills, my licenses for work, and feeding myself and the pets. Anything left over will likely be saved for any emergencies (in case I need an extra week or more groceries, etc.). I need it all as soon as possible, but I absolutely appreciate any help, even just $5. So please, if you can help us out a little, I'd truly appreciate it. I just want to get my kids somewhere safe and cool in this hot weather.

,Looking for casual business work clothes.,"Hello.

I feel strange asking for assistance but I have had a situation that has made it awkward for me to do so. There was an unforeseen leak in the plumbing that had been going on for some time. It was under the house but it managed to spray into the walls and the floors. I had started to become sick and could not concentrate for about a month before this was discovered. Mold had grown throughout the walls and the flooring and all through the things I had against that wall in the bedroom. I didn't have a dresser. I kept my things neatly folded in boxes and crates. 

The leak has been fixed and the wall and the flooring in the bedroom and bathroom has been replaced. My health has cleared up with the help of my doctors and its still being monitored and with help of the mold being removed I feel much better now.

I work a full time job. But a lot of my clothes and shoes were ruined. I had to throw them away.  Most the the things I lost I wear to work. I don't have the extra money at this time to replenish my clothes and shoes. I am not a shop a holic I didn't have that much to start with.  I am female.

,"Continuing the legacy of our daughter that we lost too soon, Savannah Grace.","I apologize in advance as this is a long post, but thank you to everybody that takes the time to read it and especially those that donate or share the post so it will reach others.

In November 2017, Katie and I went through one of the hardest times of our lives when we lost our sweet Savannah Grace. For those that don't know her story, she had multiple heart defects, and the doctors told us she needed to make it to 34 weeks in order for them to do heart surgery once she was born. Unfortunately, she only made it to 28 weeks and 4 days, and lived for roughly an hour after she was born.

The days, weeks, and months that followed her birth and loss were a struggle for both of us. Although nothing will ever take away the pain or emptiness, we were fortunate enough to find A Memory Grows and attend one of their retreats. The day after what would have been Savannah's first birthday, we attended the 4 day retreat. The atmosphere that this retreat provides is amazing, and it helps to connect people who are unfortunately going through this same painful journey. The retreat helped us find ways to deal with our grief, and learn how to celebrate our children even if they aren't here with us. A Memory Grows also holds a variety of other events throughout the year that are intended to recognize our children who are gone too soon.

Katie and I have continuously struggled with finding a way that we can honor Savannah and make sure that her life has a lasting legacy. Many people probably don't know that October is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month, so we decided there isn't a better time to start this fundraiser in her memory. We plan to do this every year starting in October since it is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness month, and it will end on November 7th which is Savannah's birthday. Our fundraising goal each year will be $1,000 for every year old Savannah would be, meaning the goal this year is $2,000. This seems like a steep goal for this first year, but my hope is that every person who reads this will share it and it can reach people all around the world. Going through the loss of a child is something I wish nobody ever had to do, but we hope that getting the word out about A Memory Grows and raising money for this amazing organization will help those who are walking or will walk this same journey.

I provided a very brief story about Savannah, but we love to share her story with anybody that will listen. If you see this and don't know the longer version of her story, feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to share. Although she isn't here with us, we are still very proud of her and the impact she has made on so many people.

Below is some information about A Memory Grows.

The mission of A Memory Grows is to provide a space of healing and peace for parents who are grieving the death of their child. By bringing together those who have experienced a similar loss in a retreat setting, we honor and celebrate our children while making connections with others who truly understand our journey. A memory grows, where love carries on.

,Sharing for a young friend in a disgusting home,"Hey reddit! Sharing this for a friend that is desperately trying to get out his parents' house because there is a lot of mold, bugs, and the walls are falling apart. He began getting sick a few years ago but his parents are unhelpful and careless. Now that he has a job and is old enough to get a place by himself he really needs help funding his deposit to get out of that dump and get some basics. He'll be starting from scratch because nothing in that house is salvageable. I'll be helping with furniture and food when the time comes but all I can do for now is share, share, share. And hope we can get him out of there. I've been in the house and the stench and living conditions are.....repulsive and unsafe. It's urgent that he leaves.

Hey all, first off I want to thank this community for the opportunity to post this in a place where it can reach more people beyond our family and friends on social media. I am currently the treasurer of a student organization and started this GoFundMe because we currently are operating on a very small budget. The organization is called AVW Studios and we make short films from start to finish. This is our first year as an independent organization and are in desperate need for equipment and other supplies. Even the cheapest film equipment is very expensive and supplies such as tape, clips, stands, etc. quickly add up. We're asking for $2500 to get us on our feet and help improve our productions. All of our cast and crew are volunteer college students looking to build their resume and fuel their passion for film. The club has played a major role in helping many students in the organization land the opportunity to have internships in Los Angeles through our college program. Any size contribution is appreciated and will go a long way. Even if you aren't interested in donating, I encourage you to check out our YouTube page which is linked in our GoFundMe description (I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link to YouTube here.)

I am trying to help my teacher back in HS (1993-94) ...she's currently in her late stage breast cancer, and it's truly devastating to see her and her family suffer, not counting the stress of her medical expenses. I donated, but it's just a drop in the bucket, I'm hoping this fundraiser can help with many of their medical expenses.

They are based from the Philippines. It's a country that doesn't have the kind of insurance we have in the US...and organizations that are supposed to help are too bureaucratic, you can't get assistance unless you know someone. So everything they pay is out of pocket or help from friends and acquitances.

**Together, we are raising $50,000 to build a technology center for 1,000 underprivileged youth of the Ojibwe Tribe Boys & Girls Club on Leech Lake Reservation in Minnesota.** 

In the U.S., Native American Reservations have the most urgent need for help. Fewer than 10% of homes on tribal lands have access to internet. The Leech Lake Bank in particular struggles with high rates of alcoholism and drug use, and most of the children in the Boys & Girls Club live in extreme poverty. Only 10% of Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe children go on to higher education (compared to 29% of the general population). Our new center will provide supplies, teachers, training, and support to 1,000 kids in need, inspiring them into higher education, career paths, and greater positive impact on their Tribe.  


My personal goal is to raise $1,000 by September 30th.

,My shiba inu Shiro had two knee surgeries within a month and a half - student needing aid,"[proof](https://ibb.co/8rZ1ScL)

On July 29th, my 7-year-old Shiba named Shiro tore the CCL (ACL ligament in people) on his back left leg and required a vet-recommended procedure to stabilize his knee on August 6th.  His first surgery went smoothly and was a great success. 

  
Unfortunately, one month into his recovery the second CCL on his right knee has now torn too.   I knew that this was a possibility when he had the first procedure but was not expecting that it would happen so soon.  The cost of the first surgery was $3273 with medication and follow up appointments, and I am now looking at another $3000 - 3200 on top of it, plus the physical therapy he'll need afterwards.  He’s already been scheduled for surgery on the morning of Sept 16th, and I could really use any help at all to help cover the cost.  The initial surgery wiped out most of my savings, and now with an unexpected second one on top of it, I’m stretched extremely thin with basic cost of living plus a student loan that I am still paying off.  I will probably be overdrawn on my accounts for the next few months unless I manage to make up for the cost of the second surgery.

You can find my gofundme [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/9s3hwh-shiro-needs-surgery)   


**Note that there is no risk that he will be put down.  He has received the second surgery and is now recovering.**  


Any and all donations will be sincerely appreciated.  Even if you can only give a few dollars, it will help me and Shiro out immensely.

,Zente the Hungarian boy age 19 months is suffering from SMA 1. He has a chance to be fully cured by shot in the USA that costs around $2.1 million. Could you maybe help him?,"As a disclaimer, I am in no way related to Zente other than I donated to him. I got permission from his mom to post his story.

"" He was born in 2018. His family has been endlessly proud and carefree by his arrival, but soon life has challenged them since he has been diagnosed with SMA. SMA is a life-threatening genetic disease, which causes drastic motoric and respiratory muscle waste. By this time he wouldn’t be supposed to move, to sit, or to breath independently without the help of a drug called Spinraza. We remember when he could hardly move his little feet. We faced early the fact: the risk is his life. We were so afraid, but Spinraza charged us with hope, so we started to fight. Due to the treatment, he could regain certain movements and abilities. However, behind the scenes, there are incredible efforts, since the doses are provided periodically for all life long, and the administration itself is painful and invasive.

Our son is a little fighter. I admire him. He is just 19 months old, and he has already had 6 lumbar punctures. He knows what is hard work since he is spending a lot of time with physiotherapy.  As parents, we need to stay strong, and we need to convince ourselves that his struggle is his opportunity to live.

In 2019 May another, a new drug was approved by the FDA, called Zolgensma and it cures SMA. The new drug repairs the chromosome by a virus in a way that Zente’s body would produce enough protein to move, to play, to laugh and to grow up strong and tall. It can be taken until the age of 2. Last but not least,  the real innovation of Zolgensma is the administration: it is one single shot. There is only one obstacle to get it: the cost is 2.1 million US dollars, and with this price, it is the world’s most expensive drug

What if we could achieve a one shot cure? I guess it would be such a relief as swimming in a pool for  Zente : a life without the burden of gravity. A chance to let him live free. We had to give it a go...""

Making a donation for you only takes a couple of minutes while for him it could mean to be cured forever. Please consider his case!"
,My mom was murdered and I need some help with funeral expenses,"I don't like to ask for money but I'm in desperate need of some help so I have no choice but to ask. 

My mom has always had a wild side ever since I was young, she lost a baby back in 2000 and ever since she's struggled with alcohol and keeping a stable lifestyle. My sister and I lived with our grandparents as well as my mom off and on. Over the last five years we lost both of my grandparents to cancer and this kind of destroyed what was left of her. She got into drugs and got into a little trouble and had to serve about 6 months in jail. She had basically dug herself into a hole and didn't really have anywhere to stay once she got out and started seeing someone and was staying with him. A couple weeks ago she called me and was telling me she left and was staying somewhere else because he was treating her badly and bringing other women into the house and basically kicked her out. We don't communicate a whole lot because most of the time she didnt even have a way to communicate. At some point in the last couple weeks she went back. Yesterday I received a call from my uncle that my mom was dead and that she had been shot. This POS killed my mom and then took his own life.

The whole situation is bad enough in and of itself but to make matters worse, she had no life insurance or savings of any kind. As her eldest child it's all falling on me financially to try and give her some sort of funeral. Add to the top of that list my sister lives all the way across the country from me and she has very little money. I'm trying to help with the cost for her to fly home on top and essentially I need to come up with a few thousand dollars to do the bare minimum. 

As I said before I really hate having to ask people for money but I feel I have no choice 😔. It's been a terrible year for my family especially my fiance and I. We've had two miscarriages this year an attempted suicide of a close relative and now this. Hospital bills from the MCs on top of us having our wedding coming up next month and now this. It's killing us financially and emotionally. We just really need some help anything will be appreciated more than you can know. If proof is needed I can post the news article from yesterday. Thank you so very much in advance.

For years now I’ve been taking care of my mentally disabled grandmother as her CNA while raising my younger brother (our mother passed). It’s been rough balancing both, but I’ve been able to do it. In May of this year my grandmother had a massive heart attack which left her without oxygen to her brain. That lead to a brain injury as well. Most of her memory is shot, and she’s re learning a lot. My Go fund was created because in the months after her heart surgery our financial situation has become abysmal. Keeping up with what her insurance won’t cover while taking care of myself and brother has become almost impossible. She’s currently in a nursing home, and bills are piling up. Me and my brother have to move at the end of the month as well, so I created my go fund me to help catch back up financially. Also to get the money so we can move on time. I’ve had some luck and have raised about 25 percent of my goal, but I’m still a ways off, so I thought I’d try to post it here. Thank you all for reading, and I hope you can help.

Among them: overweight, high blood pressure, blindness, weak kidneys, both legs have a diabetic foot, which is why she cannot walk at all. She need pills and periodic injections and intravenous droppers to help sustain her in healthy condition. Right now we can only afford the pills. Her health can get worse in a few months if we don't continue her proper treatment.

The problem is I got into debts after my father died. I started to take small loans. But over the past year the debts kept increasing. I had to take new loans to return the previous loans. Because those loans need to be returned in full the next month with big fees. I started to take extra shifts at my job. It helped for some time until it wasn't enough. And it was exausting. I tried the second job but it didn't work out because they paid very little, it wasn't enough to return the loans. Right now I need to return the full amount. If I don't, those small financial firms have legal right to sue us and take our property including the apartment where we live. For some time our relatives and my co-workers were helping us financially, but right now they no longer can help us.

,Emergency Move,"About a month ago I made a post over on tennant help (which can be found in my post history) about how the property I rent was sold and the new landlord immediately told myself and my brother that she wanted us to move out ASAP so that she could move into our unit.  She initially moved into another, smaller unit on the property (it's about six units total) and hadn't been able to take a look inside ours until after the sale was complete.  When we told her we needed time to save up to move, that perhaps we could move by spring of next year, she told us that she would post an eviction notice if she needed to.

In the intervening time since that initial post, my brother and I have managed to come to an agreement with her to terminate the tenancy in exchange for minimal moving costs.  This would put us into essentially the same situation we're leaving; renting in a tourist town where housing for locals is scarce and the rates are exorbitantly high.  I started a GoFundMe before we knew what the landlord was going to do and expected an eviction notice any day.  I've left it up, and I'm making this post now, in the hopes that I can raise enough money for us to put a downpayment on a house.  It's not a big one, and it's a prefab home, (the owner is only asking $52,500 for it), but it would give us a sense of security and purpose that we have never had our entire adult lives, as we have rented the entire time.  We are close to halfway to what we would need to meet the minimum requirement of 20% for a downpayment on the loan.  If we had another few months to save, we would barely be able to get there on our own, however, homes sell very fast in this area and the seller would not wait that long in addition to having come to an agreement with the landlord that puts us on a strict deadline.

The ultimate goal is to pay off the loan as quickly as possible, sell the house, and use that money to move closer to our family.  My father is 77 and while he's doing all right living on his own now, I would like to be close enough to help provide the extra care he will need when he eventually gets to the point where he will no longer be able to live on his own.  My grandmother spent the remaining years of her life in a group home where she did not get the best care and I would like to prevent the same thing happening to my father.

I'm providing the link to my GoFundMe [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/zbhbrk-emergency-move?rcid=r01-15689357408-6ea7e02f611246a7&pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w).  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated."
,11-yr Old Boy Attempted Suicide,"So this is a pretty heavy post. As it’s still hard to wrap my head around.

I was going through my son’s (11M) phone a few weeks ago, when I came across a text message conversation between him and his friend. His friend telling him that he was really struggling at school (he goes to a different school). He had decided that he could no longer make it on this earth. My son was talking him off the ledge, trying to get him to understand that he was loved and needed here. 

Mind you, I had no clue my son was dealing with trying to help his friend. I had no idea the kind of weight these children were bearing on their shoulders.

My son contacted his parents as to try and get some relief for his friend. My son was on the phone with them when the boys parents had discovered the suicide attempt. I’m literally crying as I type this. 

My son held this all in. His friend held this all in. Luckily, my sons friend is going to be ok for now and he is getting the help he needs. 

That being said, my son and I decided that it would be a good idea to walk in Out of the Darkness, community walk, put on by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. My son wants to see people get the help we need. If you have anything to spare to sponsor us, it would mean the world.

,My first walk with my wife - this is for her brother (my brother in law),"Hi all,

My wife and I will be doing a walk with our 18 month old. The donation is for: American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. It's been 15 months since my only brother-in-law died by suicide. He was only 26 at the time. We still talk to him in present tense because, no matter what, my wife still has a brother. Times have been immensely tough with this new dark cloud above us, but there are some bright moments too. Therapy has been a major help to us, and I've been doing the best I can so my wife can cry on my shoulders every night. Some nights I want to cry for our loss, but I feel like I don't deserve to cry because she lost her best friend and only sibling.

Anyway, being new parents has been a blessing and a challenge, but we're very fortunate that grandparents live nearby! It is amazing seeing our son grow and learn something everyday. Even though he can't speak so many words yet, he almost fully understands what we're saying. 

Especially since last week was National Suicide Prevention Week, it's been a very emotional time.

As I'm sure anyone can imagine he and his family are not only dealing with this daunting situation, but also the enormous financial strain that comes with it.

Thank you everyone for taking the time to read this, and of course to those who are able to help.

Here's the message from his wife, Christy:

> My family had the rug pulled out from under our feet when we were told all 3 grafts failed from my husband’s triple bypass 2 years and he needs a HEART TRANSPLANT.

> Our first thought was of our girls... he wants to see them grow up, teach them to drive, cheer them as they graduate, and dance with them at their weddings. The girls need their Daddy. They are so close to him and love him so much. And I need him as my best friend and husband.

> He has always taken great care of himself. His heart issues, we have discovered are due to heredity.  He’s a life long vegetarian, does not eat fried foods, non-smoker, former triathlete. He was selected to participate in Ironman Hawaii, but could not participate due to back issues that lead to back surgery.

> The past 3 years have been rough for us. Eric has had the back surgery, a series of at least 4 heart attacks during Hurricane Harvey while at work which lead to the emergency triple bypass, our little surprise baby arrived and now this. We have zero savings left.

> Any donations will be used for his medications (one is over $2,000 a month) , groceries, medical bills, doctors and specialist appointment co-pays, household bills (car note, rent, electrical, gas, and water) daycare for our girls , and travel expenses for his medical appointments - tollway fees, parking and meals.

> We will find out soon what his status is on the transplant list. We do not have an idea of when the transplant will take place - it could be 2 weeks, 2 months, a year... it depends on when his donor heart is ready. He will miss at least 8 weeks pay when the transplant occurs. I will also have many days where my pay is docked. I only have 5 days left to take off and still receive my pay. He will be in the hospital anywhere from 7-16 days. I want with all of my heart to be there with him, to help him as he needs, to ease my heart and worries, but due to losing pay, I will not be able to.

> Any donations or gift cards (if you are local and know us) will greatly be appreciated and help us in this journey God has sent us on.

She has an amazing story. Exactly how she is still being tough and fierce is beyond me. I would have ran for the hills and become a hermit. 

Due to Chemo and the fact that she is a physical therapist working at a school district she is not able to work for an extended time. She was just able to close on a house with an elevator for her wheelchair bound son a few months ago. Now she is making only 50% income on disability while she gets Chemo and isn’t able to meet her bills each month. 

Please consider her for your giving. I know she will greatly appreciate it.

,Lighting Up the Darkness of Cancer," Hi everyone! 

On October 5th I will be participating in 'Light the Night' sponsored by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society in order to shed light on the darkness of cancer. 

My mother recently passed away from cancer in January. Since her passing, life has been undoubtedly harder for my family and I. She was the brightness in every room that she entered and I am hoping to send a little bit of light up to her. 

By providing a small donation, you can help people like my mom who were impacted by this awful disease. The money raised through Light the Night allows the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to fund treatments for people who are suffering from all forms of blood cancer.

Help me defeat the darkness of cancer, please. Any small donation helps!

,Trekking the Himalayas to raise funds for Children’s Hospital,"www.justgiving.com/Tom-griffin4

In October 2018 I boarded a plan to Tanzania with a bunch of strangers to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in order to raise money for Alder Hey Children's Charity. I mainly did it for me, it was an amazing opportunity to personally accomplish something and in the process, raise money for a great cause.

That trip changed me.

The Mountain stripped us bare, it was the hardest thing any of us have ever done, and after spending only 8 days with people who I hadn't met before, we descended that mountain with an unbreakable bond, shared stories and experiences, a deep honest perspective of ourselves and strong friendships which have remained.

The stories I heard from my fellow trekkers, their reasons for wanting to raise money for Alder Hey, hearing the amazing miracles which are performed in that hospital on a daily basis and meeting people who may not have been here if it wasn't for that place have really made an impact on me. It's made me want to help Alder Hey for all of their reasons as well as my own.

I have taken a year out of fund raising this year to focus my efforts on reuniting with some old Kili trekkers in October 2020 in the Hamalayas and do it all over again, getting no sleep, questionable food, bloody feet and freezing limbs but the best feeling imaginable when you've completed the 10 day trek knowing you've personally accomplished something and helping to change the lives of children and their whole families, many of who I've met as a result of being in the Alder Hey community.

I'm asking everyone I know to dig deep and give what you can. I'm trying to raise money on here to contribute towards the total amount needed of £3,500. If you can't give financially, there are so many other ways to contribute and effort is appreciated just as much as cash. Thank you.

,St. Jude's 5k Run to End Childhood Cancer,"Hi friends! I'm running the Nashville St. Jude 5k at the end of this month (September 28th, 2019) and am trying to help raise money for the St. Jude Children's Hospital here.

[http://walkrun.stjude.org/sarahmorris926](http://walkrun.stjude.org/sarahmorris926)

Here are the main reasons I'm supporting the St. Jude Children's Hospital:

* Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for anything – because all a family should worry about is helping their child live.
* St. Jude has helped push the overall survival rate for childhood cancer from less than 20% when we first opened our doors to 80% today.St. Jude won’t stop until no child dies from cancer.

Thank you all very much! Looking forward to running this race and, more importantly, bringing awareness to all that St. Jude's does for families!"

We aren't asking for the full cost of all of the bills; just a little assistance to cover what we can't. We are at our limits and don't want to wind up losing everything. Anything at all will help, and all of it will be going to her medical bills. Anything we don't need will be returned.

https://imgur.com/a/MKgWeW9 Here is a photo of just ONE of the bills (this is the biggest one and the one we need help paying; insurance only covered part of it, but we have a whole stack along with that, which we are working on little by little) and also of our poor littlest one stuck in the hospital with this awful disease. Every day I would take her to the window and she would say, ""Look Mama, it's sunny outside. Maybe we can go swimming?"" And I would have to swallow the lump in my throat and tell her we couldn't go swimming because she wasn't able to leave yet, we were stuck there and it was absolutely horrible. The amount of horrible blood draws and IV jabs and digging around to find a vein, it was a traumatic nightmare for all of us but especially her. I hope she can live the rest of her life without being affected by this awful thing."
,"My friend from a lower-income background, who helps everybody, was struck down by illness and hit with a family rape; but he has demonstrated nothing but resilience. Now he's in a really difficult position and he needs others to help him. Will you consider?...","Hi all,

So I'm posting this to help my friend, because he hasn't received such a great response and it's starting to affect his mental and even physical wellbeing with all the stress and burden.

My friend comes from a very poor family, where his parents couldn't afford to support him in his studies. Not only did he manage to self-finance his studies up until now, but he did so whilst dealing with a terrible illness that took away his nerve sensations in his left-side face, and also whilst dealing with the horrendously violent rape of his sister in the family home. Somehow, he got through it, whilst also giving countless hours of his time voluntarily to help people who couldn't afford to pay for legal advice and representation, as well as people who have a case for their innocence whilst in prison through the Innocence Project.

My friend is an awesome, kind-hearted guy, who cares a lot about freedom and liberty for everyone, as well as individuals. He even helped me when I was going through a horrific time not being able to get access to my children, free of charge. He has wanted to be a Barrister (Attorney) since as long as I have known him (15 years old), and due to his family background he has had to work, save, sell and borrow to get to where he is now. He is so passionate about the law and about helping others that I cannot imagine him in any other career. Additionally, for him, not only has it been a rollercoaster, but his huge success so far academically and professionally, has come as a huge source of pride for his peers and family.

My friend is about to begin his pupillage. This is like a training contract with a law firm (but different with Barristers and in the UK). It's in London, with a good Chambers (firm), but they only pay the Pupil the minimum amount, which isn't anywhere near enough to live on in London whilst paying sky high rents, and keeping on top of law school debts. He is terrified that he won't be able to continue his career, will be left with nothing but debt, and won't be in a position to practice as a Barrister and help both individuals and society, to access justice.

Please will you guys read his story on the fundraiser page, and consider making a donation (anything you can afford) as well as sharing the page? I know even the tiniest donation will be hugely appreciated by him, and will give him some hope that his efforts have not been in vain.

If you would all take time to read his story so far, and consider a donation, he could reach his target. Just take a few minutes of your day to click the link, read what he has to say, and then make up your mind.

The link is below. I really do hope I can get the ball rolling for him. He deserves and needs this. Please just click it and read it at the very least.

,Five year old cancer patient seeking £500k to further treatment abroad.,"This little cutie is five, he’s been in hospital since Christmas - in isolation and receiving chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant. 

Two weeks ago they found out the cancer has returned and is growing at a rapid rate. 

His previous treatment has been funded by the NHS but they’re unable to fund a second round of treatment for another 12 months but due to the rapid growth of the cancer, he’s unlikely to make it 12 months. 

There are private treatments available in the UK and a specialised treatment that they’re looking at in Singapore. 

This family only have one child, the couple have been together since high school and are now in their mid-20s. They found their baby had cancer at Christmas, and consequently he’s missed his first year of school and spent almost a year in isolation at hospital.

,Helping Our Eagles Soar: Creating Lifelong Readers - 6th Grade Students of Color in the Bronx,"Hello there everybody!

So I am pretty excited to say I just started my first year as an actual teacher. I work at the Eagle Academy for Young Men in the Bronx and I am the teacher of a 6th grade reading class. My class is designed to engage my students in reading and to bring them up to their grade appropriate reading level.

Through reading questionnaires, I found out that many of my students lack computers and books at home. I have devised a plan to provide each student with a tablet to allow them to read texts in class and at home. At the same time, this will likely be one of the few opportunities my students ill be afforded to interact with technology, something which is crucial to their future academic and professional success.

,Help my dad walk again,"Sorry in advance for the long post. 

In February of this year my dad had to be admitted to the hospital for an infection in his foot. Being diabetic and on dialysis for the past few years has really taken a toll on his health. 

What started as a small infection led to additional issues which left him hospitalized to this day. All of this has been incredibly taxing on his physical and mental health but has also (obviously) effected my mother and myself. As an only child I have done everything I can do to help him and my mom through the difficult time this has been. 

The ordeal has been hard but we have been able to make it through a lot of the challenges. I have had to put my life on hold to make sure that the lights and water stay on but have made it work. 

The biggest issue and the reason for this post is a challenge that I cannot get past alone. A month ago the complications became so dire that my father had to have his left leg amputated below the knee. Around the same time I found out that his tax credit that he was getting for his insurance had run out and despite reapplying I have been unable to get it back. So his insurance went from a manageable 165 USD a month to 850 USD per month. We were able to spend every penny of our savings to pay for August but as of September 1st his insurance has been cancelled. 

He is still in a medical facility but we are unsure how much longer they will allow him to stay without us being able to pay. I spoke with the insurance carrier and they said that if we are able to pay the past due balance that he can get his insurance back. I am hoping that with your help I will be able to reinstate his insurance and if possible pay for next month. 

I am hoping that by then I will be able to either reinstate his tax credit or find him a new insurance provider. I am posting here since I have already reached out to many support organizations and have not been able to secure any funding to date. 

I feel backed into a corner and I don't know what I can do. I have asked family and friends but no one seems to be able to assist me any more than they already have. 

A family friend set up a go fund me page and it was extremely helpful to keep life going for my parents but the money that has been raised is spent and I am at a loss except to ask this community for help. If we can get his insurance back on he can be transferred to a rehabilitation center to possibly get a prosthetic, learn to walk again, and live out the years he has left outside of his bed. 

If any of you can find it in your heart to donate I promise that when I am able I will pay it forward some day in the future.

,Campaign to End Child Genital Mutilation,"I Started a campaign back in February to fight for equal protections for children in regards to genital cutting/mutilation. Currently there are 27 states that have laws exclusively protecting girls, these laws also protect them from religious and cultural cutting while boys and intersex children have no such protections.

He decided to go to a festival with one of his co-workers after work on Saturday night. Called his fiancé and asked her if she was alright with it and to tell her where he would be. It was Sunday morning and he was headed home when he got into a terrible accident. He has several fractures and will be out of work for an unknown amount of time. He went through 2 operations and there are potentially more to come. He has insurance but him and his family ask for help in their time of need and support.

They ask that people please lend a helping hand for medical bills that are not covered by insurance as well as personal bills. It would be highly appreciated. He isn't one to ask for help but given the circumstances he has been left with no choice."

12,360km away and 13 hours apart.. I live at the other side of the earth. First of all, even if we would want to meet each other as soon as possible, it would take us a long time since I am still in College and he's got certain Mental Health problems..

We met through this app called Bottled. Honestly, the reason why I was there was because I was in a very depressive state and I just wanted to enjoy my last few days since I had suicidal tendencies. It was that day in July that I decided to end my life.. Along the way, I met him. In a very unexpected way, we started connecting and just talked more.. I knew then he was also having suicidal tendencies at the same time as I did. We started talking more and things became different. Our feelings started to grow and I was falling in love.. I got to the point where I questioned myself whether was it really right for me to decide about ending my life. I found out I've been making him happy and that I was able to help him get through his roughest times. I didn't want to end my life or leave him, knowing that I've been such a great impact. He's been a great influence too. He has been there in my ups and downs as he became one of the reasons why I'm still here.. living.. and still in Reddit! haha.. I owe him a lot. I realized a lot of things and we've been dreaming of seeing each other. I want to meet the person who became the reason why I'm alive, well and now seeing life and the world differently. I desperately want to thank him for everything and be able to see him so I could be there for him as well.. Especially in these moments where he's been having a lot of trouble with his mental health and I've been a great help in keeping him sane and filled with happiness to go through the day.. I do owe him a lot. I personally want to thank him , see and just meet him. Maybe our feelings would even grow when we see each other.. But I really do love him a lot.

Thank you so much :) Any help is appreciated. Please help us make this possible. I hope you guys understand how desperately we want to see each other."

,Someone very close to me is risking losing her home after months of disability with no pay.,"(Copied from a post to a separate sub)

Someone I have known online for a very long time, after many months of suffering, well and truly need help; I've done all I could, but now, she faces a hurdle which I feel cannot be surmounted without external aid. She's a rather reclusive person, and would rather her name and face not be shared at all, unfortunately, so I haven't much of a name to refer to her by.

Having known her since April of last year, this friend is a person that has become very near and dear to me; a brilliant mind studying medicine, working as a paramedic; she's obtained full scholarship to university, only needing to pay her way through living expenses. A truly creative and kind soul, an aspiring artist, and the person who convinced me to keep going in life after I had long decided to throw in the towel from severe depression. She's in her early twenties, and lives alone, without any real contact from an estranged family, in contact with very few people in person due to her rather reclusive nature. Yet, she kept her bills paid by working as a paramedic, which did so quite well... Until disaster struck late last year. An incompetent partner ended up dropping a laden stretcher on her wrist, causing a torn ligament, and mid-carpal instability, the many bones in her wrist no longer connected and being spread far apart within.

Yet, her workplace would not pay her compensation despite being utterly unable to work, due to various complications with insurance and medical. After a few months, she's burnt up most all of her saving to keep paying for her bills, and even had to start choosing which of her utility bills she could pay -- sacrificing heating, even during the middle of winter. She is barely subsisting on any form of food, able to afford little more than instant noodles; even though I've sent her food before, she's become unable to even prepare the most basic of foods with but one workable arm, having spilled and made so many messes in many attempts, not even able to properly clean her home any longer. Furthermore, her inability to act is compounded by a previous injury she'd suffered earlier from being rear-ended by a truck, badly hurting her back and rendering her unable to properly lift heavy loads, despite her doing it regardless until she absolutely could no longer work.

Now, eleven months later, unable to move or get real assistance, she's facing a large mortgage bill of about $4000 US, otherwise she will be evicted and be homeless. In order to survive, she's sold off many of her possessions, but this is nowhere near enough for her to simply pay off by such means. Homeless and injured, she most likely will not live long at all.

She is someone utterly priceless in my life; to lose her would shatter my very soul. So I must come and ask for help, for anyone who may give it; even for a small donation, you have my most sincere thanks, from the very bottom of my heart.

Beyond paying for such immediate expenses, anything beyond will go towards helping her buy food and keep her alive, and with enough, hopefully to hire some form of aid or obtain some medical devices to speed her recovery.

Thank you so much, even just for reading this and listening to my story. I have never come across someone like her before, nor will I again; it would be a terrible tragedy for such a light to be snuffed from the world. I do not like asking for help like this, and she especially hates the idea, being very reluctant to accept aid without feeling like she's earned it. But in such a time of desperation, I don't know where else to turn."
,my cousin has MS(multiple sclerosis) and her life has changed dramatically since.

,Please help my sister-in-law who was diagnosed with breast cancer at 27.,"Dear fellow redditors! 

My sister-in-law Monika (27) is going through a rough time right now. She was diagnosed with Stage 3 Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) in March. It came as a shock to all of us… Fast forward to today, her chemo and radiation therapy are now done and she is awaiting surgery in early October. But her battle is nowhere near done yet - in her particular case, the chances of any cancer coming back in the next 5 years are significantly higher and early detection is KEY in preventing it from spreading rapidly, like it did in March.

We are trying to raise funds to cover a five year enrolment at a local healthcare clinic that provides the best and highest level of care. We are very close to reaching our initial goal, we set it lower since we never thought we’d get anywhere near it... however with all the support from incredible people we’ve been getting so far we are hoping to go pass it and get to our ultimate goal that will cover the 5 year enrolment. 

After everything that she has been through, all I want for her is to have the peace of mind that she is properly looked after and taken care of (there is only so much we can do as a family, with this we have to rely heavily on medical professionals). For those of you who are interested, you can read the full story on GoFundMe (linked).

At this point any donation helps, or even a comment on her page to show that complete strangers support her in her battle would mean the world to her. Thank you so much!

,Please help my wife get surgery,"Hello,

My wife has an abdominal injury from pregnancy (twins) that insurance will not cover.  We have been to see a plastic surgeon who can help her, but the costs are significant ($14600), trying to support her and 3 kids are hard enough, so I'm asking for help.  We have raised about 2000 so far, but need more.  The surgery is to repair her abdominal muscles, and remove the excess skin from when she was heavier and pregnant.  Specifically, a Fleur de lis belt lipectomy is what the operation is called.

,Raising money for cancer research in Boston,"Hi all! I am trying to raise money for the Jimmy Fund Walk, which gives money to adult and pediatric cancer treatment and research through Dana-Farber Cancer Center in Boston, MA, USA. I signed up for the 5K to support my friend Allison, whose dad was treated at Dana-Farber for a rare blood cancer. Unfortunately, after a specialized transplant, George became very ill and passed away. Allison loved her dad very deeply. She wants to go to this walk so she can honor his memory. It's going to be cathartic and difficult for her, and I want to walk next to her.

I also signed up to support my son's 5-year-old bestie, who I will call Elliot for the purposes of this post. Elliot was supposed to be out of preschool for a week to remove a benign tumor. As it turns out, he has cancer. Elliot has been unable to start kindergarten. He is still in the hospital trying to recover from surgery that he had almost a month ago so that he can start chemo. There isn't much in the way of pediatric cancer research, so Elliot and his fellow cancer patients at Boston Children's need all of the help that they can get.

I didn't realize just how much money I needed to raise to participate in this walk. While several people in my life have been able to donate, most haven't. I would greatly appreciate your help in raising money for this important cause and allowing me to walk side by side with Allison.

,Need help for my friend suffering from depression and diabetes. Recently lost his home.,"Looking for financial support or weight lifting equipment for my best friend. 

He's 39 years old and extremely over weight. He is diagnosed with diabetes and schizophrenia so it's really hard for him to lose weight. 

He recently moved in with me because he lost his house in a fire in Paradise California and has nowhere else to go. He's having a very hard time and struggling with his mental health, fitness and finances. We're doing the best we can but money is tight. Most goes towards rent and very little for food or health food. 

I would really like to help get him motivated and get his spirits up so he can start again and I think that some dumbbells or weight equipment would be a good push to lift his spirits and improve his health.

He has brought it up before that If he could afford to lose the weight and had some equipment he would exercise regularly and become a better person. 

Please help anyway you can...

,I need new wheels for my wheelchair,"Hey Reddit. 

Everything is explained on my GoFundMe page, but I'll write some details here. I've been using wheelchair since 2013 because of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (Type 3). I was able to push myself around for a long time, but lately I can feel my arms getting a bit weaker. I could use electric wheelchair, but it is recommended for me to use my arm strenght as long as possible. The wheels I want to buy have a motor inside of them which would help me push myself MUCH easier. The wheels I want to buy are called \*\*E-Motion M25.\*\*

,I'm Doing a Charity Livestream on World Suicide Prevention Day to Promote Mental Health and Raise Money to Help a Suicide Bereavement Support Group.,"Tomorrow is September 10th, World Suicide Prevention Day. To commemorate it, I'm doing a  twitch stream to raise money for the Southwest Metro Denver Survivors of Suicide nonprofit as well as the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. Here's how money will be distributed:

* 100% of the first $500 is going towards the Southwest Metro Denver Survivors of Suicide nonprofit.
* After the first $500, it is a 50/50 split between SW Metro Denver Survivors of Suicide and the National Suicide Prevention Hotline.
* 0% of it is going to myself (obviously)

For those of you looking for some information about SWMDSoS,  here is their official website: [http://www.swmetrodenversos.org/](http://www.swmetrodenversos.org/)

And because I need to provide a link to the stream itself, here it is: [twitch.tv/darkdevero](https://twitch.tv/darkdevero)

The official time is set to go live at 10am MST tommorow and will run until at least 1 pm MST. The founder of SW Metro Denver Survivors of Suicide will be on stream too!

**Donation isn't necessary**. While half the reason is to raise money for these amazing causes, the other reason is to educate viewers on suicide prevention and give out resources for those struggling with depression.

&#x200B;

I hope you tell your friends and fellow supporters about this good cause. I personally have been helped by causes such as these (I've struggled with depression for years and every now and then it still gets to me) and so I want to give back."
,Any help for Michelle would be appreciated. She has had a hard time recently and she is truly a sweetheart.,"Once upon a time, there was a naive young girl who believed that being kind to others was the key to happiness. This young girl believed that she wouldn't have sex until she was married because she was a hopeless romantic.... Then she ended up in an abusive relationship where she was raped by the person she loved most. She was too scared to admit this of course, so she convinced herself that he didn't mean to hurt her and that having her virginity stolen was a choice.

Five years later she was finally brave enough to escape her abusive relationship, but she escaped in mountains of debt. This young girl had never been around the world of drugs and failed to figure out that her abusive ex-boyfriend was stealing all her hard earned savings for heroin.

She did her best to move on and to forgive this person who had broken her, and continued to believe in karma. She tried her best to move on because she didn't want to hold hatred in her heart. Five years of being committed to someone who treated her like dirt; she decided it was time to have her first real ""date"". 

After being sexually harassed by many men; she finally found a nice older man who seemed like he cared. She decided this was who she wanted to have her first date with; and had dinner and drinks at a lovely restaurant. After being the perfect gentleman all evening, he convinced her to drive him home as he had more than a couple beers. Little did she know that this was just an act to lure her to his house. After he finished raping her and finally let her leave, she realized that she was losing faith in karma.

This girl has spent her entire life focused on helping others. She wants nothing more than to be a teacher and help change the world. So she kept on being kind and did her very best to see the good in others. 

Eventually she began to feel like all people were going to hurt her. She still plastered a smile on her face and tried to keep positive for the people around her, but inside she was fading. It was then that the next strike came....

Having started a new job a couple months prior, she was beyond excited when her new co-workers invited her to hang out with them after work. She finally felt included and safe. At least, until one of her co-workers drugged and raped her.

That was when she stopped feeling safe in her own skin.

Every day, she went to work and tried to pretend it was her fault. She had to throw up any time she heard him laugh, but she pretended she was ok. As her PTSD got worse and worse, she was able to move a couple seats away from him. Thinking it was her fault for letting it happen, she decided not to get a rape test or press charges.

She planned on remaining silent at work too, until she realized there were others. She found out that he was sexually harassing many women at work and was scared that what happened to her might happen to someone else.... That's when she decided she had to go to HR and make sure he didn't hurt anyone else. 

During their investigation, HR made her PTSD a million times worse. She was having nightmares and seizures on a daily basis. She managed to get short term disability leave approved because she couldn't get near her work without getting sick and having panic attacks. After closing the investigation and a couple weeks into her approved disability leave, she was fired.

Now struggling with permanent scars both physically and psychologically, this girl is drowning in medical bills and is trying to find a way to pay off the money her ex stole..when  she no longer has a source of steady income.

She has tried so hard not to ask for help, but right now, she needs it. Please help prove that there are still good people in the world.

,Please help me become an LGBTQ+ Therapist," Hello!

My  name is Jeffrey, I am a graduate student looking to become a therapist  specializing in LGBTQ+ youth and young adults. I am currently in the  Advanced Standing Program which is a fast track to getting my Master's  but requires a lot of time and studying. Instead of having a normal  semester where the class goes from September to December classes are  condensed so that I am doing a semester worth of work. research, and  papers in about a month. On top of this I am also required to spend a  good deal of my time in an internship placement. As it stands I am  taking the maximum amount of loans possible and it still might not be  enough.

I have long struggled with  my faith and my sexuality, being raised  Christian and discovering I  was gay. I developed severe long term  depression and frequently had  suicidal thoughts. I never received help,  and it took me years and a  few scares to finally pull through, I never  want that to happen to  another. I decided to start my path to becoming a  therapist  specializing in LGBTQ+ youth. Every step in my education have  further  solidified my passion for social work and helping others. My  professors  have each commented on my empathy and  professionalism. I successfully  convinced my class to run the first-ever  LGBTQ+ event for our Macro  Studies class. I was able to lead the class  to run one of the most  successful events ever where we brought in  surrounding GSA (Gay  Straight Alliance) students to learn about resources  available to them  and that the community cares. With the Help of the  South Coast LGBT  network, we had over 100 people in attendance, when  typically these  events have about 20. With the help of so many and my  class, I was able  to fulfill a life goal of mine, and I know I can do so  much to help if  given the opportunity.

I  just wanted to thank you for spending the time reading this, and if   you were able to donate; Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, Thank   you, every dollar is one step closer to me becoming a therapist and   helping others and help prevent them from going through what I did. 

Please feel free to contact me for more information or if I can improve this post. Thank you.

tl:dr I want to help people, especially lgbtq+ youth as a therapist but I am lacking in funds

I  should also mention that it is difficult for me to get grants and  scholarships because the program is technically part-time despite the  work and internship requirements being full time.

,In dire need of help for my three year old Great Dane suffering from cancer,"Hello Reddit;

I am posting here as I am in dire need of assistance for my beautiful three year old Great Dane. On August 22nd my wonderful ball of joy was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma. Without any treatment, she will likely only have 2-4 months of life left. With aggressive treatment, she may yet live up to two years.

My first goal in her treatment is Amputation of the cancerous leg. Due to the size and position of the tumor, she is in a good amount of pain and because of this she is on pretty strong pain-killers. Another reason for the recommendation of amputation is because of the damage that has already occurred to the bone. The cancer tumor has made her bone in her leg very weak and has a high chance of breakage. For this reason, she is on a mild sedative and only wants to sleep and cuddle. Even though she is a giant breed dog she would adapt quickly and well to amputation. This would drastically improve her quality of life, she will no longer need to be on the sedative and will be able to enjoy the remainder of her life as a three-legged tripawd. Recovery is only 2 weeks!

,CAMPAIGN TO GIVE ZAB(DESK+SCHOOL BAG) TO STUDENTS IN RURAL KARNATAKA.,"My name is LAASYA VENUGOPAL and I am in Grade 12 at the Candor International School, Bangalore.  


I have undertaken this campaign because I think education is the biggest variable for changing the lives of kids in govt school. In these schools, students lack everything from books to school bags. Further schools in rural areas lack basic educational infrastructure like a desk & chair.  


Most of the students in these schools sit down on the floor for long hours. Sitting on the floor and studying for 6-8 hours affects posture, resulting in back pain, poor eyesight makes it difficult to concentrate and study. I like the ZAB BAG as it solves the problem of a tough durable school bag and doubles as a school desk. The fact that raising 20000 INR or more can give a ZAB BAG (DESK+SCHOOL BAG) and transform the lives of 50 children or more is something that I am very excited about.  


Please support my campaign and let us together impact and improve the lives of these fellow students in govt schools in Karnataka. This will over time am sure result in better grades for these students as they will find sitting in a classroom is more enjoyable.

The tl;dr is that a young child suffers from a rare disease and has a birthday coming up. I think it would be amazing if we could all pitch in and help Rhys have the best birthday ever.

You can also contact the mother on Facebook by searching ""Birthday cards for Rhys"". 

I know Reddit can come together and do amazing things, so please, take the time to at least fill out a birthday card for Rhys. Rhys like's all sorts of things, especially football(soccer), Fortnite, and fast cars! 

I hope everyone can help the best they can."

,Help a disabled USAF veteran lay her mother to rest.,"Hi all, I know you dont know me or my family but heres our story. 

My mother passed on Saturday and she was ADAMANT that she not be cremated. So I am trying my hardest to pull funds together to pay for her service. 

My father passed very suddenly in November, my family all came together and emptied our bank accounts to fund his memorial. Then in January my uncle passed and we had to cremate him because no one had the funds to pay for his service. My family is tired of donating to all these memorials and thinks I should just cremate my mother and ""get it over with.""

I am a disabled USAF veteran and a single mother to 3 kids on a fixed income. The only income I have aside from my VA disability is my boyfriends paycheck. 

The cemetery plot is about $4000 and the funeral home services are about $3600. 

This is my last ditch effort. If you are unable to donate, please share it around your circles of friends. Please reach out with any questions you may have.

Read on or go to [www.youth-in-christ.org](http://www.youth-in-christ.org/) to learn more about Youth in Christ. 

Living Waters for Christ Inc., T/A Youth in Christ, a Catholic, 501(c)3 nonprofit based in Ellicott City, MD. Our mission is to bring the Good News of God’s great love to families by giving them tools and opportunities to experience and share this love in the greater Catholic Church, in their own homes, and in their communities.

God has chosen to be at work in and through families throughout all of history, not just to make His plan of salvation known, but to make it a reality. Young people need as many in-roads for the Lord to access their hearts as possible, and parents need support in raising their families in the Faith. We offer four resources to support them: Ablaze Family Group original content, Family Prayer Project, the Rise Up Middle School Day, and Sacramental Preparation original content. These opportunities for faith and fellowship are family-friendly, faith-filled, and fun to remind families of just how real and relevant God is in our lives today. Most importantly, they are geared towards helping people deepen their relationships with God and with each other, in the hopes of reinvigorating the domestic Church and instilling the next generation with a love and passion for Jesus Christ.

,Kiddo has never seen his grandparents," We have been trying to save enough money for the past few years to fly East and visit my sons paternal grandparents. Unfortunately something keeps arising that drains the account. New breaks on car, laid off from work, etc. We would like to take a week off and fly 3,000 miles to see grandparents that have only seen their only grandchild via photos and heard from via phone. The funds would cover the flight for two (to save on costs), hotel and rental car. We have a dedicating savings account set aside for this trip. Any remaining would be spent while visiting in order to have as much fun and time together as possible in one weeks time.  We would like to aim for February of next year weather and airfare costs permitting.

Thank you for your consideration.

,"Recovering from a TBI, clinging to my apartment by a thread","Hello everyone. My name is Jeremy. I was a parkour instructor in New York and suffered a brain injury unrelated to work in an accident. I spent the greater portion of this year recovering and unemployed, oft relying on family and friends to keep me afloat. My recovery has been speeding up as of late but I still need assistance.

My main concerns now are food and rent. My GoFundMe picked up momentum when I first posted it and with what I had raised, I had been able to clear my accrued debt to the management company of my building and thus narrowly avoided eviction. Unfortunately, I have not made enough getting back into work to get by this period. It's a long shot but I've shared this everywhere else I could and I'm hoping this reaches enough people to help me get by at least this month, as I expect to finally be on a stable working schedule again after this. Bless you all for the help you give out to everyone on this sub. Be well and best wishes.

,My Mom's Esophagus Can't Boogie!,"My mom has been suffering from achalasia for the past 25 years. This is almost half her life!  
It's a condition where the esophageal muscles are paralyzed and basically nonfunctional and food can't get passed to the stomach easily. It also means that the opening at the end of the esophagus is malfunctioning and doesn't open during swallowing.

Her first dilatation was what would be called a success. It opened up the esophagus and bought her 8 years of life as a healthy person. Then it started ed gradually becoming worse, and she stopped eating. It got to a point where she couldn't eat anything or drink water. She lost 20 pounds. At this point, she was still working full-time and taking care of her four kids.

She decided it was time for medical intervention again and had a Heller myotomy, which is supposed to relax the esophageal muscles. All seemed well a few months after, and she was eating rice and meat and things that healthy people take for granted!

Then, she shared with us one day that she can no longer keep her food down. 

We found out about a procedure that might help her with her swallowing a little bit. We all know that she probably never will be able to live normally, but if we can raise the money we need for the procedure, it might make a difference for her.

,My car blew up on my birthday and we're trying to find a way to work for my husband,"So, long story short March 2018 my husband was let go from his position at a company he had hoped to retire from. He randomly had a mental breakdown due to major depressive disorder and stemming from exhaustion (he had been working 7/12s at the time) and was fired because the company doctor deemed him unsafe for the workplace. He was cleared by his diagnosing doctor and a psychologist. I do have a lot of proof for all of this; including doctors notes, diagnosis paperwork, emails between him and his office, and an offer of the severance agreement they tried to get him to sign. For the last 18 months he has went to therapy and flipped flopped medications to get a good mood stabilizer and has had many jobs through a temp agency. This mental breakdown RUINED us. I've been a stay at home mom since he was in the military, 8 years ago, and we are in such a rural area any jobs around here dont even pay enough to even out if we were to pay daycare. It put us in so much debt. We had to drain his pension. At the beginning of august he finally got a break. He was offered a position at a new company in the same field. He found out he has enough time working in the river boat industry to apply for his licensing to drive a boat under a captains watch and can potentially lead to a huge promotion. 

&#x200B;

How we got here-Wednesday on his way to work a main seal in our car came out. Our car already had electrical issues so the oil light didnt work (we did not have a gauge). By the time he arrived at work the engine had already began knocking and on his way home the next morning (my birthday) the engine gave out completely. We were able to get a ride for him thursday and friday but at this point dont know what to do from here. Weve called everyone and it seems like everyone is down on their luck. We live in an extremely rural area and theres no public transportation or ubers out here. He works 70 miles away so its not easy to find someone willing to drive him all week and pick him up at 7oclock in the morning. This was our last resort, we were just hoping to find a ride for the week and buy some crappy car when his paycheck comes friday but we have no way for him to get to work monday and tuesday and we just dont know what else to do. The last year and a half has been hell, hes tried really hard to get where he is after coming to terms with this diagnosis and having to learn on his own that the stigma around mental health, is just that, a stigma. And the thought of losing this opportunity over something so small and that we can fix on our own, come friday, is just terrifying and heartbreaking. If you can just share my gofundme that would help immensely and anything donated is so greatly appreciated.

I have found multiple cars for around 1000 dollars so i am shooting for that amount right now, we just need something to get him through until he can build up a solid work history at his new job.

Thanks for reading!

This  Navy Veteran with a hypoxic brain injury is as creative as they  come.  Steven served in the US Navy for 5 years and sustained a hypoxic  brain  injury during his enlistment. During his time in service, he  worked as a  medical hospital corpsman, attached to Marine divisions  across the  globe doing his job and earning many awards for his character  and  dedication to duty. He sustained his injury through carbon monoxide   poisoning and was in a coma for 7 days. After awakening in the   Intensive care unit, he discovered he was unable to walk and went   through years of therapy to regain control over his ability to walk and   speak coherently. Despite his injury he is striving to make his dreams a   reality by creating a children's animated cartoon. You can check the   link below to see what he is working on.

Steven  is a video editor, illustrator, storyboard artist, and  animator. He  has amassed over 60 million total views online with his  video editing  and creative skills. He received his BA in Fine Arts at  St.Andrews  University.  In his spare time, he focuses on learning  the        essential artistic techniques, as well as pursuing video  editing and  animation in order to build his network.

If  you find it in your heart to donate, it would be much  appreciated and  help this veteran make his dreams a reality. The funds  will not only go  towards medical bills for his brain injury but also  start up costs to  make this animated series a reality. With a big heart,  Steven wants to  instill love and a strong environmental message with  his works. He sees  how humans have affected nature and wants to put out a  series that  will bring attention to the changes humanity has had on the  planet.  With your support, Steven will be able to clear his medical  expenses so  he can focus on building a series and getting picked up by a  network  to create his dream series. Any amount donated will be used to  pay  these bills and go towards building his series. We greatly  appreciate  your time, and if support is strong enough, Steven will even  give you a  character in his upcoming series.

Much love, and thank you for all your support.

The Charity
For those who don't know about Macmillan Cancer Support, they are a group who provide physical, financial, and emotional support to those affected by cancer. This includes information about treatments and guidance on dealing with it effects. Advisers to help deal with money and work matters, as well as benefits and grants. And emotional help and reassurance to to those whose lives have been affected by cancer. You can find out more here: https://www.macmillan.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do

Our Campaign
A friend of mine, Shaun, has decided to run a 24 hour stream of Dungeons and Dragons in order to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support. The 24 hour roleplaying session will consist of 4 sessions, each five and a half hour sessions starting with the first at 6pm BST 30th August, the second at 12am 31st August, the third at 6am 31st August, and the fourth and final session at 12pm midday 31st August. (All times BST).

Alongside 5 others I with will be participating in the second session that starts at 12am 31st August.

The Game
Welcome to Warsong of Descent! The event is a 24 hour live stream, where the same DM takes four groups of players on concurrent adventures into the ruined city of Myth Drannor. Will they be able to unravel the mystery threatening to bring about hell on Faerun? Or will they all fall as the DM goes increasingly mad from sleep deprivation.

Donation Incentives
If you can spare anything as a donation it will be greatly appreciated. As an incentive we have put together a list of in game items you can unlock for us to use during play.
[Please note in your donation which you choose!] 

£1 - a potion of healing
£1 - any piece of mundane adventuring equipment
£1 - any common magic item (such as a Cloak of Billowing)
£2 - a re-roll to use in a game 
£5 - any uncommon magic item
£10 - any rare magic item
£20 - any very rare magic item
£30 - any legendary magic item
£50 - character starts one level higher. 

Now, I am personally a firm fan of a little bit of chaos being good for the soul, and it  certainly makes things more interesting. Our DM Shaun agrees, and you could instead donate to add to the deck of random effects that will be triggered during play, by donating here instead: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/aacampaign 

At the time of posting we have managed to raise a combined total of over £1500. This is an incredible amount and has already surpassed the donations we were able to raise last year. Our goal is to raise at least £2000 by the end of the stream. We understand that not everyone is in a position to donate, so we ask you to share the campaign and spread the message.
Whatever support you are able to give, thank you and be sure to tune in from 6pm 30th August to join in the adventure.

,Please help me become an LGBTQ+ Therapist,"Hello!

My name is Jeffrey, I am a graduate student looking to become a therapist specializing in LGBTQ+ youth and young adults. I am currently in the Advanced Standing Program which is a fast track to getting my Master's but requires a lot of time and studying. Instead of having a normal semester where the class goes from September to December classes are condensed so that I am doing a semester worth of work. research, and papers in about a month. On top of this I am also required to spend a good deal of my time in an internship placement. As it stands I am taking the maximum amount of loans possible and it still might not be enough.

I have long struggled with my faith and my sexuality, being raised  Christian and discovering I was gay. I developed severe long term  depression and frequently had suicidal thoughts. I never received help,  and it took me years and a few scares to finally pull through, I never  want that to happen to another. I decided to start my path to becoming a  therapist specializing in LGBTQ+ youth. Every step in my education have  further solidified my passion for social work and helping others. My  professors have each commented on my empathy and  professionalism. I successfully convinced my class to run the first-ever  LGBTQ+ event for our Macro Studies class. I was able to lead the class  to run one of the most successful events ever where we brought in  surrounding GSA (Gay Straight Alliance) students to learn about resources  available to them and that the community cares. With the Help of the  South Coast LGBT network, we had over 100 people in attendance, when  typically these events have about 20. With the help of so many and my  class, I was able to fulfill a life goal of mine, and I know I can do so  much to help if given the opportunity.

&#x200B;

I just wanted to thank you for spending the time reading this, and if  you were able to donate; Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, Thank  you, every dollar is one step closer to me becoming a therapist and  helping others and help prevent them from going through what I did. 

Please feel free to contact me for more information or if I can improve this post. Thank you.

tl:dr I want to help people, especially lgbtq+ youth as a therapist but I am lacking in funds

I should also mention that it is difficult for me to get grants and scholarships because the program is technically part-time despite the work and internship requirements being full time.

You guys do great work on this sub and this sight in general and I thought  I could ask for help. I have known this family  for little over a year and I want to help. The family is a very nice group that doesnt normally ask for help. Gracie is a very good kid that hardly ever complain that has an amazing work ethic.

This is really straining the family and they are  trying to do whatever it takes to survive the ordeal.

,[request] (fl) Lost my job due to going to court dates for my daughter,"Hi everyone, I'm in need of help with getting some stuff to prepare for the hurricane coming towards us. I recently lost my job Because I have had court dates/therapy/doctor appointments etc..for my 7yr daughter who was sexually assaulted. The man who did this to her got sentenced to a life sentence last week so I am looking for new work but until then I have no resources to provide for this. I don't know what/ how my family is going to recover from what has been done but I'm terrified to have nothing for this hurricane.
Thank you for reading"
,"I don’t normally do this, but i’m at the end of my rope","I don't normally ask for things. It's difficult for me to even try. So posting something like this is taking a lot, but I'm desperate enough to do it. I have no other choice.

I have a 2008 Honda CR-V. It's got some front end damage, and she eats up gas like nobody's business.....
Currently, my car payments are at $322 a month.... when I started work out of college, I had a decent car, and a decent job. I worked at a group home for special needs and I was doing well there to the point of where I could afford the payments. I then moved to a Day Program because I wanted to make more of a daily difference... and it included a pretty large pay cut. Because of this, my car got repossessed...

At that point I was desperate. I had no way to get to work, as my mother does not have a car, and I had TWO jobs. And because of my credit situation with the repo and student loans, I got stuck into the $322 a month car payment.

I now work as an Assistant Manager of a group home, and have on-call responsibilities to 5 other homes within an hour and a half radius. Even with the promotion, the cost of the car and gas is still to much. 

In order to get another car that's not as expensive on gas ($40 a week at least) and monthly with my bad credit score, I need a large downpayment. I'm trading my current car in, which puts me in the negative since I still owe money on it. 

I am asking for help raising $10,500 (extra 500 is to account for GFM’s fees) to get a newer car with a better monthly payment and better gas mileage. With the lower payments, I would be able to afford it, as well as gas and my basic necessities in life. It would also be a newer model car, which would last me much longer.


I am working 2 jobs right now and it isn't enough. I also am planning on going to nursing school, which would be much more driving to get to clinical locations. Aka: more gas $. I cannot afford this anymore, I will lose this car to a repo, lose my jobs, lose my insurance, and lose my ability to care for my family.


I feel embarrassed to admit that I had a repo. I'm embarrassed to admit that I can't afford my car payments. I am going to be putting as MUCH money aside as I possibly can and use that with any proceeds from this campaign. I have tried getting loans from every place I can think of, and I keep getting denied because of poor credit.

I really need this, and any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated. I put a LOT of good karma and kindness out, I just hope I deserve it too.

,My baby nephew had to have life saving surgery.,"August 6, 2019 Mason Lee Templeton was born by emergency c-section.  The doctors treating Mason were quick in recognizing that he had a heart murmur and did an echo-cardiogram. That test showed he had a rare congenital heart defect and he was sent to a larger hospital to be treated by a team of medical professionals in NICU.  His mother would join him in a couple days.  After that, the NICU doctors did more tests and joined forces with Mercy Children's Hospital in Kansas City (about 160 miles from home).  When he was 1 week old he was flown by med-flight to Kansas City for more tests and treatments.  Before he was two weeks old Baby Mason had to undergo open heart surgery.  The team of pediatric cardiology surgeons worked on repairing the 3 defects to his heart for approximately 8 hours.  
Before surgery and after surgery there have been many of complications that Mason has had to deal with.  Just a couple of days ago, his heart went out of rhythm and it had to be shocked back into rhythm.  Today they were able to, finally, get the breathing tube out and him off of the ventilator (1 week after surgery) and now we found out there is damage to his left vocal cord (glottic gap). This may or may not heal on its own.  Unfortunately, it is just another set back in his road to recovery and being able to come home.  This poor little guy has been through so much and his primary care givers are struggling physically, emotionally, mentally, and financially.  At this time, Mason does not have insurance to pay for all of his medical needs, and both of his primary caregivers are having to have off time from work unpaid.  Mason is expected to be in the hospital for a few more weeks and after that he will have multiple follow up visits with multiple different specialist, and more than likely home health care and/or outpatient therapy (unknown completely at this time).

,Our 5 year old daughter with brittle bone disease (Osteogenesis Imperfecta) broke her femur and needed surgery during insurance waiting period.,"My five year old daughter slipped and fell while playing a few days ago breaking her femur for the second time.  She had surgery to put a rod in at Children's Hospital in DC.  She suffers from [Osteogenesis Imperfecta](http://www.oif.org/site/PageNavigator/AOI_Facts.html), which causes her bones to be brittle and break much more easily than normal.  In fact, this is her seventh break in her five years.  This is her third surgery, and we are still paying off the second one.

We are in the US, which means private insurance.  I just changed jobs, and the new company doesn't start healthcare until 30 days after hire.  We are filing for COBRA, but the premiums to cover our daughter are about four times what I was paying previously.  The last two surgeries cost around $5,000 each after insurance.  We have been able to get on payment plans for the previous surgeries and inpatient bills, but the last one was just in March and we are still finishing paying it.

,Help the women of Perú struggling with breast cancer through Iron Maiden!,"Hello everyone! Let me tell you about my friend Emily. Her life has been deeply affected by breast cancer, besides losing her mother, her aunt, and her grandmother to it, she also is positive for the genetic mutation BRCA-1, which significantly increases her chances of being a victim of the disease. 

&#x200B;

Because of this, she'll be undergoing a preventive double mastectomy in the near future, which is obviously a very daunting, difficult thing to deal with. Before having to affront this ordeal, she's decided to embark on a last sojourn with the company of her breasts. What has she planned to help her deal with this? Oh, you know. Attending to 24 Iron Maiden shows.

&#x200B;

Having seen one of their 2018 ""Legacy of the Beast"" shows, she was completely moved by the experience and ended up deciding to buy 24 more concert tickets and follow them around USA and Canada before she has to go through surgery. I present to you the Legacy of the Breast tour. 

&#x200B;

While all her costs are already covered, she realized she could take advantage of the exposure of her journey to help others. Specifically, to open a fundraiser for women who don't have the possibility of receiving proper treatment, unlike her. In particular, the women of Perú, a country which is very dear and close to her heart for personal reasons. 

&#x200B;

In Perú, modern technology used for detecting breast cancer is seldom available to most women. Due to the high costs for the majority of the country, less than 75% of diagnosed Peruvian women are able of finding out if the disease has advanced to stage three or beyond - at which point, treatment is less effective and much more expensive. 

&#x200B;

As Emily herself said it: ""It's one thing to be a poor woman in a developing country, but it's a whole 'nother set of dire circumstances to be a terminally ill poor woman in a developing country. That's why I've teamed up with Club de la Mama INEN Neoplásicas, a volunteer organisation offering support to Peruvian breast cancer patients.""

&#x200B;

As her friend, it honestly breaks my heart to see her go through this, but above all, knowing she's still concerned over the well being of others even in her circumstance makes me feel powerless and in need to do something to help her cause. Because of this, I'm doing my best to help her get a bit more of attention and help her get closer to her fundraising goal - only 414 US dollars left to reach the goal as of now. 

&#x200B;

She's also heavily documenting her tour through her private Instagram - to which all donors have access - with lots of photos, updates, videos and whatnot of her following Iron Maiden across the US and Canada in her plight for the women of Perú. 

&#x200B;

Not to take more of your time, I'm sharing her GoFundMe link - plus a video she made that probably explains her motivations much better than I could. Also, I sincerely want to thank anyone that gave their time to reading this.

Hi, my name is Larry, and I am currently having a horrible episode of severe back trauma/pain that is leaving me unable to work. 

Two years ago, I had a major episode of sciatica/back and leg pain. It was caused by two bulging discs in my lower spine. I was in a horrible amount of pain that keep me off of work for six weeks and required epidural injections to resolve.

Well, at the beginning of August 2019, it was triggered again. I don't exactly know what triggers it but this is a bad episode. I have been out of work, without pay, since August 2. I am getting more injections in my spine this week, and hopefully that will help me get back on my feet, but as of now, I'm unable to pay the coming month's rent and expenses, not to mention my medical bills.

A little back story:

My mom and I started nursing school in January. We had both tried previously but life hits you hard sometimes and it’s not the right time in life. We were starting head-to-toe assessments and my mom chose my dad as her patient. When she listened to his heart, she noticed something weird. It sounded like a murmur. 

Fast forward a couple of months and a few doctor’s office visit to comply by insurance needs before they will cover going to a specialist. Last week, we found out he has a dilated left ventricle, aortic valve regurgitation, and aortic aneurism. The doctor referred him immediately to a cardiac surgeon. The surgery has been moved 3 times due to insurance and MRSA and have not been verified for 8-26-19 My mom can only work weekends due to school. It’s an LPN program so it is full time Monday-Friday all day. She can not afford to pay all their bills since he is the main bread winner and will be out for 3 months after surgery. I made a go fund me to help pay for bills and groceries to get her by for 3 months. This man is so important to me. He adopted me. He raised me. 

I’m trying to stay strong for my little brother but it has been hard. Any help would be appreciated. 

Update: On Thursday he coded twice and they put in a temporary pacemaker and on Friday he received a permanent one. He is doing better today but is still emotional.

Good day, 1st off thank you for your time in reading this very inspirational story, and how it has changed several lives. And how it can change over 1.3 million more.   Madeleine has Cerbral Palsy. The hospital did not follow through with their job that evening, which caused a lack of oxygen to her brain , which causes (CP) and much more. Theres many like her that just got a really bad card dealt for their lives. In all honesty it can happen to you or I as well quite easily too. You could go swimming ,drown, and not be recovered properly, and your struggle could be the same. So, here is where life takes a turn. Someone once told me it's not what happens that matters, but how you handle it that makes you who you are. I am an uneducated engineer. I have passed an exam with 98 percent, and in short can and have produced amazing items since I was young. I helped with the largest well drilled in North America, I worked and learned with some of the most talented people the world has to offer in my opinion, and the equipment and tech I was exposed to led me to the product under development originally named the Gaitormeter. The better half asked me to change it to our daughters name, Madeleine, and suggested that Gaite also stays as a play on words as gate to be able to say ""it's a gate way through to another side,"" Yes, walk through a gate, and Gaite as in your Gaite in walking. Sorry if that was confusing. So, Madeleines Gaite it is I then said to her.  So instead of curling up on the couch and crying, I decided to change her path. I laid on the floor before I came up with this idea, and looked her in the eye and said ""I can not change what happened, or fix your brain"" I said to her, holding back the tears as I held her little hand ""but I sure can try my heart out to make you walk,"" Then the brainstorming came, and that saying popped into my head. This is who I am, dealing with what I had been presented. And that path seems to have not only inspired my daughter, my wife, but several more around me. So it started, I have worked with a mechanical engineer, a Neuro surgeon, and a psychologist after the original design was done to ensure no harm could be further done to a person with an all ready difficult future. I was elated when not only I found out the product could work, but also for many other disabilities.  The design works for all ages, and works around your shoe. And expands as you grow. Shoes are expensive, so opted right away it was it's better to cut costs on that, kids shoes are all ready expensive. Icould not imagine it being a purchase each time your child grows. Moving on,  it steadies your Gaite, and keeps your feet in a straight line to also provide you with assistance with forward and backward momentum , helping with balance. Basically keeping the operator in control, with little to no challenges in how you should walk.  I wont bore you with the details just yet, and as a sidebar, know I am not selling this device to medical centers, or insurance companies.  I also promise, only charging a dollar more than it cost to produce once on the open market. Here is why. A bicycle for an able child cost 60 to 80 dollars, on the other hand a walker with less moving parts, cheap to develop, included that the actual design versus a bicycle is double in cost for a disabled child. This list goes on exponentially and is consistent through the medical market and insurance companies. Hence, us asking for your assistance to change how this works.  We won't stop with this device once we get started either.  As it has gone on too long. Those with challenges should not be charged a dime if I had it my way.  To sum it up for you (if you have made it this far, thank you again if you have) I have figured out how to help those who would have never been able to walk... walk. Seems if you wear the device before you turn 4. You may not need them ever again. The neuro and psychologist said it may be able to reroute around the bad parts of the brain, due to the operator being in control of the devices operation. Instead of a computer or handheld operations. That detail alone made my heart sing with joy. I will keep all up to date in the development, and the success and failures we go through. Please, from the bottom of my heart. Help our daughter, and 1 and  323 people that have it. A child every hour is born with cerebral palsy. So the cause is worth it. My time is not only my child's, but possibly yours or someone you know or may know.    I'm not sure on how this site works fully, but I am very leery on putting up the design or plans, or the prototype. Or even the parts listed for someone taking it and profiting off of it. So as I get through some more of this and feel more comfortable, and legally secure. I can and will release as stated before. Thank you again for reading my movement through the hardest part of my life. But know this, as hard as it is for me to accept what happened to our daughter. Everything happens for a reason, and theres at least  a million reasons I can think of to keep my head up, and continue down this path. With any luck, and some help from good people, I can succeed. Thank you once again."

,"My puppy was critically ill and put me 10,000 dollars in debt to save his life. Please donate to help Mocha’s continuing recovery.","I got Mocha a week ago as an 8 week old puppy. The day after getting his vaccines he became ill with vomiting and low blood sugar. I brought him to the vet immediately where he had a critically low blood sugar of 40. He was started on fluids with dextrose. After various testing he came back positive for a parasite Giardia. 

He has has been hospitalized for over a week now with vomiting, diarrhea, and poor appetite. He is receiving treatment with iv fluids with dextrose, metronidazole, and panacur yet still testing positive for Giardia. 

His medical bills are currently around 7,000 not including the quote for ongoing medical care. The vet is unsure of how long he will need to remain in the hospital, but his bills are making me unable to continue to care for him and I don’t want to have to give him up or put him down. 

Please find it in your heart to donate to help save Mocha make a full recovery. I will be posting updates as they come. Feel free to ask any questions about his care.

,My Father Went Missing In Downtown Chicago. Refer to conspiracy subreddit for original post.,"GoFundMe Link: 

I took my parents to Chicago Friday night and stayed at a Marriott on the Magnificent Mile. I got a room for my parents and one for myself. We were in town for my father's mom's funeral. My father has early signs of dementia and he is on several medications.

Around 7:30am. my father stepped outside of the hotel to smoke a cigarette (upon my mother's approval which I am still frustrated with), and has not been found since. I have filed a missings report with CPD, but they have not been helpful at all. I understand it is a big city, but I am pretty sure they are just waiting for him to pop up. I am very concerned, because he has not had his medications. He does have seizures and I am afraid he may have had one or passed out somewhere downtown.


I personally walked 12-15 hours yesterday all around downtown looking for him. After the funeral, some of the family came downtown to help search, but we have not been able to find anything. I have left numbers at the homeless shelters in that area as well as the hospitals. Please upvote this to help me find him. I left pictures on this post. He was wearing an all black suit with a black hat. The first picture shows exactly what he was wearing. I know it is blurry. Please Chicago, help!


TL;DR My father went missing on the magnificent mile. He stepped outside of the hotel and has not been found after 35 hours. He has dementia and I am very concerned regarding his well-being.

,Please help my friend's mom battle against STAGE 4 breast cancer,"Hi! I am asking help for my friend's mom. Please help her battle against **STAGE 4 breast cancer**. Any amount will do as every little thing counts. The radiation treatment will run for 30-consecutive-days and will cost a fortune, that they don't really have.  


Background:

July 2018, my friend's 56-year-old mom, Elizabeth, was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. Since then, it has been a true roller coaster ride.  
This kind of journey requires preparation, but most of the time, life would take them by surprise.   


She went thru mastectomy just a few weeks after she was diagnosed. She was told that she needed to undergo chemotherapy after the operation.  
***Denial, fear, doubt, mixed with financial difficulties, delayed her chemotherapy sessions.***   


Right after mastectomy, they went from one 'natural' doctor to another, planted 'plants with anticancer properties', bought different herbal medicines claiming to have cured cancer patients, we totally changed her lifestyle and diet.  
Fast forward to December 2018, she went thru another round of expensive and exhausting tests. The results confirmed that her cancer has advanced to **stage 4**.  


Since then, the entire family goes thru the pain of chemotherapy sessions. Her weight loss, seeing her shave her head, looking for a wig, her weakened body, consistent confinement every month, making the hospital our second home, the bitter list goes on and on.  


Now, her supposed to be six cycle of chemotherapy sessions was extended to ten cycle. On August 18th she will have her 8th session, but her doctor advised that things are not looking good. We need to cancel the chemotherapy scheduled and go thru radiation treatment right after the 8th cycle.  
Please send help thru gofundme so they can receive help directly.

,Update on my child:," 

This is an update to my previous post, letting those who are interested know what's been going on.

Recap: On 08/02 we had to take one of the children we care for to the emergency room because she had collapsed at home, couldn't talk/move properly. Of course this was terrifying for my wife and myself. Once we were there they did a scan and found a rather large tumor in the right side of her brain. The doctor wasn't sure if it was malignant, but we had to have it removed right away. We had the surgery scheduled for the next day and we waited. They took her for surgery, and had the tumor removed almost completely. The bad news is it had begun to spread to other sectors of her brain, as well as a portion connected to her spine. (I'm sorry if it's vague, I have a lot of issues remembering specific details.) The tumor got sent off to Pathology and all we had to do was wait. This was the last thing I had updated on.Update: I am so thankful of the support I've received from this community, I've gotten so many kind words and it means so much to me. Thank all of you so much for talking to me, even if it takes me a while to get back to you it still means so much to me. While in recovery, we began to see significant improvements in her health. She became very aware again, started speaking clearly and had her old bubbly attitude back. My wife and I were relieved to see her smiling again. We received word back from Pathology after a few days of recovery and physical therapy confirming the tumor was malignant. The type of cancer she's being diagnosed with is Glioblastoma, which prior to all of this I knew nothing about. Honestly, I didn't even know that radiation therapy and chemotherapy were two different things. The doctor spoke with us, and was as blunt as he needed to be. The odds are she won't be a long term survivor, but that doesn't mean we won't do everything we can to try and improve her odds.

On Friday, 08/16 her vitals were elevated to dangerous levels, after another scan they felt surgery was required once again to find any source of infection or anything that may have caused a negative reaction. My wife and I waited in the OR Waiting room for any form of update and we got news that the surgery was successful once again. We went to meet with her and her eyes were so scared. I've never seen her look like that and I'll never forget it.

Right now she's in recovery once again. But she's been unable to talk and we're afraid for her. I know that anything that may happen is completely out of our control but it doesn't change how scared I am. That's all in terms of updates, if any of you want me to keep you updated feel free to message me and I'd be more than happy to. If you would like to help us in any way, we have a gofundme set up at: [https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-support-14-year-old-jeana-wells-medical-bills](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-support-14-year-old-jeana-wells-medical-bills) Any support is appreciated during this.

,Weston Park Cancer Charity,"For those outside of the UK, there is a program aimed towards 16-18 year olds and at the end of it, we are required to do some form of social action. So for my group we have decided to raise awareness and funds towards this particular charity in our area which isn't funded at all by the government. All money they have comes from fundraising such as what we are doing.

We are also holding a sponsored football match and a bake sale etc so it isn't just this donation page as raising awareness for our local community is just as important. According to statistics, 1/2 people will be diagnosed with cancer sometime in their lives, which is very scary to think about. This charity helps provide the care and support for the families of the patients who are there and offer a separate program for younger patients to make them feel more comfortable.

We would greatly appreciate if you can share this donation link or donate yourselves as all the money raised on the site goes directly to the charity:

,My dad left my mom in pretty bad financial shape when he left her.,"I saw her post this gofundme and I felt really bad. I know it's a bit much to post here, and I honestly feel kinda embarrassed posting this even if it was something this reddit was made for.  I'm not that financially well off myself so I hope you guys at least attempt to share this. 

The separation was a huge shock to me, but what was even more shocking was how my dad left. Just basically decided he was done with it all, and took off with some other woman. I've been trying to at least pester him into making the divorce official but he'd rather just avoid the whole thing. 

Essentially it had a lot to do with how they were doing disability, and deemed my mom making too much money because of my dad but he doesn't live with her anymore but they're charging her for the excess anyway.. And apparently was missing property taxes as well. 

I don't know what to do but I hope posting this will at least get her some help. Sorry for imposing..

,Ways to help frugally?,"Good late morning!
Maybe not the perfect place to post but I don’t know where else to. So here is the situation- right before school started (it started August 7th here) a boy and his mother moved next door to us. We live in a pretty basic middle class small town neighborhood. Most homes here are owned by occupants but some are rental units and the house next door has been converted for years into a duplex of sorts. It’s a fairly nice set of units and we have typically had couples alone or single mamas as the units are two bedrooms. 
I have three boys and a girl myself. I am not a nosy person really but I’ve been trying to figure out the situation with the family as the little boy seems to be lacking a lot of what he needs. 
The child is a year younger than my youngest. Most of the summer when we’re home the little boy is here. He’s a bit of a handful and I’ll admit he gets on my nerves as much as he does my kids. My older kids especially but even the one close to his age has a hard time tolerating the poor kid. It seems like part of his issue is lack of attention. 
As I said I’m not a nosy person but I can’t help but see it seems the mother doesn’t ever leave for work. She’s on her cell phone, outside, most of the hours I’m home talking loudly and saying kinda trashy stuff- constantly telling whoever she’s on the phone with they don’t wanna make her mad, cussing about this person or that person, etc. so part of the issue is lack of attention clearly. 
Another thing that became more apparent is the kiddos clothing situation after school started. This summer it didn’t hit me as too unusual that he walked around barefoot or in flip flops and that his clothes were ill fitting, stained, or had holes but I’ve noticed this to be true now that schools started. I’ve tried very hard to see if he has actual school shoes and other than a pair of his mother’s shoes (I initially assumed when I saw them they were women’s because of appearance but my child confirmed he had to get his shoes back to his mother so she could wear them).
I don’t typically hesitate to help others when I can but admit I’m a little scared of what it may create with the dynamics with his mother. For the record this child is here more often than home when my husband and I are home, when school first lets out we’re both still at work and only my teens are home and he tries to come over then. Ever since I’ve let my kids be alone we have a strict rule that there can be no company over with the only exception being one child we’ve known since infancy and my father. The kids told him this yet the poor child comes daily anyway. Even with all that contact the mother never talks to us, never checks on him, and other than smiles and waves hadn’t done anything to know us. Not that everyone in the neighborhood does that but it would seem you would want to at least know someone’s names if your child was there so much. We don’t know her name and only know the child’s name. 

I want to get him some clothes and shoes. Having four kids I want to figure out how to do this as frugally as I can- we did just get four new wardrobes and shoes for our own plus sports needs we have one in Soccer now one in football one in dance. I also need to know how to give this to him, with his mom being a stranger without it being weird and without her thinking we are rich because I wouldn’t give her cash. 

I’ve helped friends many times but they were friends - it was awkward a little but the other worries weren’t present. 

One thing we plan on doing is going through some of my boys clothes. This little boy is chubby while my kids aren’t so while I know I can find some stuff for him I don’t think it will be all he needs. For that I just plan on getting my child to give it to him. My youngest has already gifted him his old bike and Pokémon cards and this wasn’t too awkward as it just went child to child. Mom didn’t address anything and I didn’t either. I suppose I could do this with the new clothes too but I kind of wanted to talk before hand because if it’s new stuff I want to make sure it’s the right size because I feel like this child may possibly need husky sizes but I’m not sure because my own kids are skinny...and of course I would want any new shoes to be a perfect fit I would almost want him to be sized. 

Anyone have tips? To add I’ve done this within my church many times but it was under the umbrella of the church. I used my money but the church encourages us to do this if we’re so inclined and accepts it as a tithe so it can be “from the church” to not create the weird dynamics I’m so worried about. This kiddo doesn’t ride the church bus so I can’t do that with him."

,My Cat is Suffering & Needs Dental Surgery,"My 10 year old domestic long hair desperately needs to have two of her bottom fangs removed. She's been struggling to eat for a week now, crying out in pain whenever she takes a bite. I've been able to switch her to soft cat food, of which she's extremely happy to have as she was starving herself. But she's still having a hard time eating.

Her vet says she needs two fangs removed and a cleaning to prevent the disease spreading to her other teeth.

I'm on disability and unable to afford the full amount for the surgery. I’m digging into my savings and doing what I can to save more, but because of my low income it may take years to afford it. I’ve contacted every vet in my area to get the lowest possible quote.

It's killing me to see her like this, she's my best friend and has been with me for 10 years. She's been completely healthy and happy up until this point.

There's a lot more information on my [GoFundMe Page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/whiskers-dental-work), including the quote I received from the vet.

Any help at all would be greatly appreciated, even if you can just share the page and her story it would help tremendously.

,Where are the most generous people ?,"Hi everyone,

I present you my last video which shows the countries where people are the most generous.

[The link of the video](https://youtu.be/Z6jvAvCKbq8)

The data comes from the CAF World Giving Index which indicates ""It looks at how and why people around the world give to charity. In this, the eighth edition of the CAF World Giving Index, we’ve collected data from 139 countries, which represents an incredible 95% of the world’s population.

The report includes questions about three different types of giving behaviour, with each country ranked according to their answers to helping a stranger, donating money, volunteering time.

To establish a rounded measure of giving behaviour across the world, the CAF World Giving Index relies on a simple averaging of the responses from the three key questions asked in each country. Each country is given a percentage score and countries are ranked on the basis of these scores. The Index measures countries by proportion of population giving rather than how much they give.""

Do not hesitate to confirm me or not if you could feel this during your travels if you needed help."
,First responder needs help in hour of need.,"I am sharing this gofundme for my fiancé.

,Help with our daughter's Epilepsy needs,"Our oldest daughter, was recently diagnosed with Primary Generalized Epilepsy w/ Absence and Tonic-Clonic, Fugue State Seizures (PGEAT for short) by the neurology department at Children's Hospital. Children’s Hospital has become our stomping ground, in tandem with an Epileptologist located in Minnesota at the Minnesota Children’s Epilepsy center. We've spent a lot of time over the last few months in-patient, as well as well as weekly lab draws, EKGs, MRI imaging, and hospital ER trips, after multiple tonic-clonic (otherwise known as Grand Mal) seizures, myoclonic and absence seizures by the hundreds, every day.

We are happy to report that after months and multiple medications, we seemed to have found a combination, that is currently allowing our daughter to live life day to day here at home. With the right combination of anti-seizure medication to start controlling her episodes, we can start on the road back to normalcy. While this is a long and arduous process, she is being unbelievable brave through it all. We are seeing a new psychologist weekly who is helping with a lot of big feelings surrounding this current challenge, have a new primary care physician who is working alongside her Epileptologist and a fabulous home aid/tutor helping keep us up on her schoolwork until 6th grade. She is subdued, not her normal self, but currently willing and able to tackle this head on.  

Every year, the Washington Epilepsy Foundation provides a 3-night summer camp called Camp Discovery for kids diagnosed with epilepsy. Since she has been responding to her medication, we’re happy to say that our daughter's neurologist has given his approval and she’s able to attend the camp and spend time with other kids her age that share her condition! She is very excited about the possibility of meeting other kids her age who are going through exactly what she is, and enjoy summer camp activities like hiking, swimming, high ropes course, and art therapy - some good kid fun. Camp Discover is being held mi-dAugust, in order to attend, we have to stay within a two-hour drive of the camp’s location.

In order to keep our family safe during the day and especially at night, we now need to purchase seizure monitors for our home. Fortunately, modern technology provides amazing options, including wearable monitors and bed sensors. Donations will go toward the purchase of the following, as well as medical expenses, medication and travel to and from Camp Discovery.

,[NSFW] Donate to Rescue Dogs Rock to help dogs like Sunshine,"https://rescuedogsrocknyc.org/

This video (NSFW, no blood but still incredibly disturbing) shows the current state of Sunshine:

https://youtu.be/4I_IiRVFs6U

Sunshine was left tied to a tree to starve to death by an abusive owner. The owner still has more dogs in her custody, and they're working around the clock to both rescue them, and prosecute her.

Sunshine currently cannot swallow, so it's definitely an uphill battle.

For anyone wondering if this is a reputable rescue organization, you can follow them on Instagram and subscribe to their email news feed. Also, I recently adopted my own little ray of sunshine from them, and she's healthy and happy.

Please donate to this - they REALLY need the help to save all these poor doggies."

,My Dad is having open heart surgery,"This may be a little long. Very emotional today and I’m on mobile. I’m sorry. 

A little back story:

My mom and I started nursing school in January. We had both tried previously but life hits you hard sometimes and it’s not the right time in life. We were starting head-to-toe assessments and my mom chose my dad as her patient. When she listened to his heart, she noticed something weird. It sounded like a murmur. 

Fast forward a couple of months and a few doctor’s office visit to comply by insurance needs before they will cover going to a specialist. Last week, we found out he has a dilated left ventricle, aortic valve regurgitation, and aortic aneurism. The doctor referred him immediately to a cardiac surgeon. He saw the surgeon on Tuesday and scheduled the surgery this week in 8-14-19. My mom can only work weekends due to school. It’s an LPN program so it is full time Monday-Friday all day. She can not afford to pay all their bills since he is the main bread winner and will be out for 3 months after surgery. I made a go fund me to help pay for bills and groceries to get her by for 3 months. This man is so important to me. He adopted me. He raised me. 

I’m trying to stay strong for my little brother but it has been hard. Any help would be appreciated.

,"Help me help my sweet pittie, Ruby","Hello all,

A few months ago my girlfriend and I adopted a pitbull from the Wisconsin Humane Society, and at the time they only told us that she had an upper respiratory infection, but that was not the case.

As it turns out, she also has rectal prolapsing, so every time she poops part of her colon comes out of her anus. This obviously is not ideal, but we have been trying to mitigate the issue with our vet. Nothing has worked up to this point though, and 20+ vet visits, $6,000 spent between training and medical costs, and 3 different smaller surgeries later it has been determined that she will need a much more intensive and expensive surgery to (hopefully) fix this issue for good this upcoming Wednesday.

We have [started a gofundme](https://www.gofundme.com/f/ruby039s-surgery-for-rectal-prolapsing&rcid=r01-156562327919-dadeba718b584f4f&pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w) (where you can read more of about her story) which we have already shared to family and friends, and they have helped tremendously, but I wanted to reach out wherever I could to try and see if a) anyone is willing or able to donate or b) can just share her link to spread the word to anyone that can donate absolutely anything.

,Possible help for a friend with a rare nuero degenerative spinal condition.,"https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jen-get-surgery-to-stop-rare-neuro-disease

Hello Dear Redditors,

A friend of mine has been struggling for some time with a rare spinal condition called idiopathic syringomyelia which has caused a syrinx (which is a large cyst) to grow in her spine. 

Unfortunately due to the rarity of her condition, the surgery available here in Canada is very invasive and difficult to perform.

She was scheduled for surgery to have a shunt placed in her spine to help drain the fluid but at the last minute the surgeon cancelled the procedure due to how large the cyst had grown and fears that the procedure will leave her paralyzed.

The only option left is for her to travel to Barcelona and go to the Chiari and Syringomyelia Institute where they can perform an operation that is far less invasive than what is available in Canada.

Getting the money required has become another significant problem because her husband was in a car accident a few years ago that has left them struggling financially as they also have a young son to care for.

If you guys and gals wouldn't mind at least taking a look at her gofundme and help spread the word for her that would be tremendous. If you have the means to be able to graciously donate as well it would mean the world to her.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this as well as look at her gofundme page and I hope you have a wonderful day."

Hi everyone!  I never realized there was a charity sub-reddit before, so I’m coming here with not much time left until this event, but nonetheless, I’m here, let’s see what we can do!

I live in Brattleboro, Vermont, and we have a mental health facility here called the Brattleboro Retreat.  Ten years ago they started a program called the Uniformed Service Program to provide assistance to police officers, fire fighters, EMTs, correctional officers, and veterans who suffer from PTSD, substance abuse, or mental health issues like depression as a result of their job.  

At the same time, they launched the Ride for Heroes, a motorcycle ride designed to raise funds to help keep the program afloat.  I have been participating as a “Ride Champion” fundraiser for five years now, and plan to participate every year they continue to put on the ride.  

I have a fundraising page that puts any and all donations directly to the cause, it is a Classy.org page, but I bought myself a domain name to simplify the process and make it easier to share with people.  If anyone here feels driven to donate, I know so many officers who have used the program who would appreciate it.  And on a personal level, my cousin was a marine suffering from severe depression who three years ago took his own life, if any of us knew what he was truly going through, I feel this program could have truly helped him.  Please help me and all of those in need of this program and make a donation if possible, every little bit helps!  Thank you!

Can you Imagine being far away from your family getting that news? I can!

When I was sick and in a foreign country, her home country, I was treated with kindness and respect and love, even from strangers. That treatment despite parts of my illness manifesting in ways that could easily get dismissed as ""Mental Illness"" and even though I had ILLEGALLY overstayed my visa due to forces outside my control. The local immigration officer there did not put me in a cage, he came to visit me in the hospital. In fact, most of my medical bills were refunded.

And while I was there, one (of the many many people) who showed me kindness was Reshmi, a neighbor who was suffering from breast cancer but still invited me over to share meals and be part of her family. We literally were worlds apart in culture and background, but she invited me into her house and into her life.

I was saddened to hear about her turn this week and I feel I am obliged to try to give back. Please join me and share this message and give. I challenge everyone to find ways to show love to people around the world, not dwell on the darkness.

We recently discovered that she had a very large tumor, it scares me so much. I can't do anything but feel helpless and I want to do absolutely everything I can to help her feel better.

She was rushed to the hospital and had the tumor immediately worked on, however we're afraid that its been too long.

My  friend suffers from fibromyalgia and is currently undergoing diagnoses  for psoratic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Her current  wheelchair is no longer fit for purpose as it causes her considerable  pain to use for any real length of time.

Unfortunately  she is not eligible for funding assistance for a new chair as she is an  ambulatory wheelchair user (which means that she is technically able to  walk, even though it causes her a large amount of pain and puts her at  risk of falls), so she is having to try to raise the money for a new  chair herself.

Her gofundme page  explains her situation far better than I could hope to on her behalf,  but at the moment she is all but housebound with very little mobility  and really struggles to attend all the appointments and hospital visits  required to treat her conditions.

I  am writing this post to try and help her in any way I can. Having  mobility and independence mean the world to her, and she is terrified at  the idea of not having the freedom to move around because she can't  afford a chair. (Her health problems, both physical and mental, leave  her unable to work and she is in receipt of benefits.)

,Artist in need,"First of all, I hope this post doesn't offend anyone and that this is one of the right subs to post this into. I apologize if my post doesn't meet the criteria, I would like to receive some suggestions in the comments if I am doing anything wrong.

I am a freelance comic book artist and illustrator. I recently had a lot of expenses generated by moving houses and by a seemingly infinite series of unforeseen events. Car breaking down, law expenses for a family issue, two unexpected travels between others. I worked day and night to collect the money over the last 45 days, but it seems is not over yet. In the meantime, I collected major burnout caused by the stress, mild carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms (can't work too much with it) and definitely a lot of social isolation.

Car broke down again, and I am short of almost a grand for the beginning of the next week. Rent is comic up together with a couple of bills, and I'll need between EUR 890 and 1100 to stay afloat. I can manage to get some by a friend, but not that much. I put 1000 as the best strategy possible to avoid nasty surprises and it would be of great help if I could reach that cap in the following days.

Some of my clients won't manage to pay me on time, and I tried many ways to get that money, including Reddit and a bank loan (failed attempts). I won't be able to collect enough quick commissions to cover the costs in such a short span of time, so this is my last resort. 

Any help would be extremely appreciated.

,Desperately Need Help To Get Out Of Crisis | All Help Would Be Appreciated,"Posting the following on behalf of a friend, https://www.reddit.com/user/The-Phantom/

To all the generous members of this sub-reddit,

I am a 30-year-old guy from Pakistan. I've been working as a freelance web content writer from home for the past 11-12 years. Presently, I am primarily supporting my household, which includes my parents. There have been a lot of ups and downs in my life, perhaps even some highs, but somehow I've managed to help make ends meet.

Shortly before April though, I wound up losing a major source of my income. So, I decided to invest some money into my own blog/website, for which I had to purchase a domain and web hosting. I was fairly certain and hopeful that I'd finally manage to earn a decent monthly income, while also creating something of my own.

Unfortunately, I haven't managed to earn anything feasible from it. Yet, I haven't given up hope and am working hard on getting it off the group. My blog/website is just 3 months old, so I am still hopeful and positive that this venture will eventually prove to be fruitful. I am also an author and I've published some erotica, but it isn't too lucrative yet either.

Getting to the point though. I know this may sound bad and wrong, but for my own personal reasons, I had to lie to my parents and I've claimed that I've managed to earn $1,200 over the course of the past 2 months or so. It may not make sense why to you, but although I'm the one earning, my father handles the household budgeting and financing.

Hence, considering that I do not have $1,200, I now find myself in a crisis. Once again, it is too complicated to explain, but my parents will flip if they discover that I do not have the money I claim to, which will lead to dire circumstances. Consequently, I've been experiencing tremendous anxiety and depression since the past week or so. I don't mean to exaggerate or gain unfair sympathies but I've been feeling a bit suicidal because I feel like my world is collapsing around me, which may end up being true.

The reason I decided to state all of the above is to explicity present my current situation and why I decided to post here, and also for the sake of utmost transparency. I know that there are probably far more deserving causes and charities that deserve attention and monetary assistance. I never imagined that I'd find myself in a situation like this, but I'm utterly desperate and panicking.

TL;DR: I am in desperate need of coming up anywhere between $800 and $1,200 within the next few days. I know this practically impossible, but this is kind of my last resort, so I thought I'd give it a try, in any case.

The money I receive is supposed to go towards my household expenses and rent for the month of August 2019. This is somewhat unrelated, but my father was recently diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes, so I need to begin saving money for his surgery as well. If manage to get through this crisis and raise enough money, I have vowed to turn my life around and secure a more stable source of income.

As I am in Pakistan, I cannot create a GoFundMe at the moment, but I will ask a friend of mine in the U.S. to do so. Once again, I know it is probably impossible to raise **$1,200** within 3 to 4 days but if anyone here might be generous enough to contribute any sort of amount in order to get me out of this predicament, here is the PayPal email of the same friend: chaseberg96@gmail.com

To anyone who decides to help me out, I will be forever be grateful and obliged. I may not be able to pay you back, perhaps, but I promise to pay it forward some day. While it is not mandatory, if anyone does decide to transfer an amount, it would be helpful if you could leave a comment below and mention the amount. That way I could inform my friend and above all, thank you for your contribution.

I am really afraid and panicking, and feel really helpless and don't know what to do. It's like all the happiness has been sucked out of my life because as I've stated, my life might as well be literally over, and I don't mean to exaggerate. Anyhow, I won't drag this any further.

Kind Regards and utmost gratitude to anyone who may help."

,I’m a new Teach For America teacher where we teach in inner city schools where resources are scarce. One of the biggest hurdles that these kids face is a lack of the necessary materials that are needed daily. Please help me stock my classroom so my kids have the resources they need to be successful!,"After completing Teach for America’s - 2019 Miami-Dade Institute I will be responsible for my very own classroom! I can't wait to decorate and meet my students and their families. One of the biggest hurdles that students in high need schools face is a lack of the necessary materials that are needed daily. It makes it infinitely more difficult for students to take part in activities and classwork when they do not have basic supplies.

To get the year started off right, I will use the funds that I raise to purchase the startup supplies needed to welcome my students to a classroom that is clean and stocked full with materials. This will allow me to provide the required supplies to students that otherwise would not have them. I will also purchase copy paper to ensure that I can provide my students with high quality learning materials, whether that is exit tickets, independent activities, or homework. Thank you so much in advance for supporting me and my students at the beginning of this exciting journey.

Every dollar I receive will be put towards classroom supplies so anything you can contribute really will make a difference for my first year. I want to make a great impression and a lasting impact on my first group of students and letting them know that they have a community that supports them both near and far will definitely get us on the right track.

,Help an online college student.,"Hello! 

Thank you you for visiting my gofundme page. I am asking for help in getting new components for a desktop computer! The primary use for this computer is to help me finish two more years of college at University of Advancing Technologies! My major is Game Programming. 

What happened to my old old computer rig? I recently moved states. From Ohio to Texas. I used my desktop at the time as a form of income to gather more necessity stuff to my new place of residence. I only did this because I have access to a computer but time on it is very limited. It makes doing school projects difficult when they require 6 hours a day at times to complete!! 

Now I do have a job. The problem is that I live with my girlfriends parents. So I can’t focus on the computer with anything left after my checks and won’t be able to for a few months. This makes my next semester a tough one if any coding is involved. My girls desktop is not capable of handling many applications at once and I am concerned what will happen when I try using unity on it. 

So, I am asking for any bit to help build a computer rig to finish college with. My average grades are B’s and I am the first of my family to attend college. I am dedicated to see this degree!

,Help students receive the materials (workbooks) they need to succeed!,"Hello!

I currently work in a school located in a low income area. We have almost no budget for materials and are responsible for making sure we have materials.
I currently teach a class for students who failed the ACT English section. These are seniors who on average read on a 4-5th grade level and need intensive interventions. The course workbooks are used to help with one-on-one interventions and contain their reading materials (except the novels) so they can highlight, annotate, etc.
The copies I have of the workbooks now were made from a printed copy of a copy. A lot of the sections are not great.
To buy bound copies for 33 students for 3 units will cost $891. So far we have raised $95. Any additional money raised will go to buying more units for future semesters.

,Just trying to help my sister out,"Hi, figured this was worth a shot. My sister is in her final year of high school, she is looking to further her studies into humanitarian work after and while she works hard, I feel she sometimes does not get the recognition she deserves. Recently she has signed up to do the 40hr famine, this is not her first time doing something like this, she actively participates in beach clean ups and social care outside of school. I have donated to her cause and while I intend to donate more when I get paid, my family has sort of turned a blind eye to it and its genuinely disheartening to not see support from family directly. 

So here I am, reaching out to the internet to see if anybody is willing to help her out. Thanks for taking the time to read this and even if you don't donate, have a lovely day.

,GISH Fundraiser for team Wayward Scientists,"https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/wayward-scientists-gish-fundraiser

Each year, GISH participants work to “Change A Life” by making a profound difference in the lives of people and communities facing extraordinary hardship. Since 2011, Gishers have helped a wounded US veteran rebuild his life, provided life-saving resources for Syrian refugees, given hundreds of at-risk students of a South African dance school a way to transcend poverty, and provided over 150 Rwandan female genocide survivors a co-op farm/marketplace in their quest to become self-sufficient and provide for their families.

This year, in partnership with our friend Giles Duley, a renowned photographer who travels the world documenting stories from the victims of war, we are launching, our most ambitious Change A Life yet: one that will help save and improve the lives of countless children and adults in Laos.

The Story

Imagine the most harmless-looking objects in your neighborhood are actually the most dangerous. They appear to be small, metal balls about the size of a tennis ball. They're easy to overlook and appear to be little toys.

In Laos, these are not toys. They are unexploded, shrapnel-laden bombs.

Laos is the most heavily bombed nation per capita in the world. Hundreds of millions of bombs were dropped on the country during the Vietnam War—but over 30% didn't explode. These undetonated explosives lie dormant in fields and community areas. Often, a farmer will accidentally strike one, or a child will think it's a ball to play games with and pick it up. These hidden dangers maim or kill hundreds of children and farmers. Since the Vietnam war, over 20,000 people have been injured or lost their lives - including over 8,000 children.

One of these children was two-year-old Kayeng. He and his cousins, Vaeng and Ching, decided to light a fire outside to stay warm one morning. Unfortunately, they lit the fire near an unexploded bomb and it quickly detonated, launching shrapnel everywhere.

""There was a huge explosion, and I was thrown to the ground,"" said Vaeng, ""My little cousin (Kayeng) was screaming with blood pouring from his face. My brother Ching was unconscious, and my legs were bleeding badly.""

The shrapnel from the bomb injured Vaeng and Ching, and left Kayeng completely blind.

Unfortunately, there are thousands of stories like these with children left heavily injured, without limbs, or dead.

This year's Change A Life Campaign is going to help Laos in two ways:

First, with your help, we're going to continue clearing unexploded bombs from farmlands. Your support has helped make hundreds of acres safe already for the children and families of Laos.

Second, our bigger initiative, will help fund the manufacture of much-needed prosthetics for countless Laotian children and adults missing limbs. You'll help provide limbs and arms for children so they can walk to school and play, and farmers so they can provide for themselves and their families. From the funds raised, we hope to improve the lives of thousands in Laos for years to come.

Close To Home

For our Change A Life Ambassador, Giles, this story is particularly meaningful. In 2011, he was injured by a landmine while working as a photographer in Afghanistan where he lost both of his legs and an arm. He knows what it feels like for children like Kayeng to have their lives completely changed. With the help of prosthetics, Giles was able to continue his life's work spreading awareness about the human cost of war. He wants to provide the same opportunities for victims in Laos.

""When I was in Laos, I met so many children who'd been injured in similar ways to myself. I know first-hand the pain they are in each day, both physically and mentally. I kept thinking, why should a child have to go through what I do each day, simply because they were walking to school and were injured by a bomb left over from a war that ended years before they were even born? They are completely innocent, yet they have to bear this terrible burden.""

""If documenting the impact of war means one more child isn't injured like this, my life's work will have been worth it. It's beyond words to say how much it means to me that, this year, the wonderful GISH community can make that dream a reality. Together, we can prevent many, many lives from being destroyed by unexploded bombs as well as help Laotians who've lost limbs live a richer and fuller life. Together we can help children walk to school in safety, we can enable them to play without risk of death or injury, and we can help prevent further accidents like Kayeng's. Together we can help make Laos a safer place – what an amazing achievement that would be for the community of GISH!""

Your Mission

We're going to partner with Random Acts, a 501 (c)(3), to raise $150,000 to help protect thousands of Laotians from unexploded bombs and provide countless children and adults with prosthetic arms and legs. We want EVERY child in Laos to be able to walk to school and play without fear of bombs. We want EVERY child in Laos who has lost one or more limbs to have access to prosthetic limbs. We may not achieve this lofty goal, but that's not going to stop us from trying to get close! Join us!

,[REQUEST] Need help with car repairs so I don't lose my job being unable to get to work,"I live rural, so having a car is exceptionally important. For the past few weeks my car has had the worst time starting, and last night it finally puttered out and refused to start at all. I had someone kind enough to come take a look at it from the dealership since I cannot afford yet to get it towed (since I've worked with him before for oil changes etc.), and he told me there's a valve that controls the flow of the fuel to the engine which is busted and it's not getting enough to actually start. Going back to the shop, he quoted me between towing, labor, and the part to be ""between $630 and $650"" which is ..not doable for me, considering I need to make sure I make rent today. 

This is the only car I have access to, and the only way I can get to work since affording a taxi from now until however long it takes to afford repairs isn't doable, as it's about $16 a ride to/from where I'm located into town (again, I'm rural). Really don't want to lose my job or overdraft, and not really sure what else to do. I set up a GFM in hopes maybe I could start shaving off a few charitable donations here and then to put toward this and get back on the road so I don't risk losing work or housing.

,Help me fund a film apprenticeship program for teens - 501(c)(3),"Hi,

I'm new to this board, and I'm here because I'm looking for help in reaching my crowdfunding goal to fund a really cool arts program for NYC teens.

I'm on the board of a 501(c)(3) called [Ripple Effect Artists](https://rippleeffectartists.com). We're a small arts and activism organization in NYC. In short, we create work that addresses social issues and makes a positive impact in our communities. Until I joined - last fall - Ripple Effect mainly  put on stage plays to address its mission. Since I'm a filmmaker, we thought it would be a great idea to expand into film.

So an idea was born: How about we provide film education for NYC teens of color and from disadvantaged backgrounds? 

The reason behind this is simple: I've been working in film and media professionally for twenty years, and I've always been struck by the lack of diversity in this world. Sure, it's changing a bit now, but the reality is that filmmaking is still a very homogenous industry in terms of race and class, at least professionally. And I know from having volunteered in after-school programs in the past that there is a hunger by kids to learn a craft that often seems like it has a very high barrier to entry (and in a way it does). So I want to help change that, and help expand the range of voices and stories in film through programs like what we're launching.

This year marks our pilot program and we've recruited five teens from around the city to take part.

So what does the program consist of? It's simple: we're making a movie. A short film to be precise. It's called HERE COMES FRIEDA, and it's a short science fiction film that imagines NYC twenty years from now, as it deals with the impact of climate change. The teen apprentices have been working side-by-side with professional filmmakers to produce this film - they've been involved in every facet of the film so far  - from helping conceive the story, through learning how to budget and schedule the film...and now we're casting the film and looking to produce it in early September.

The idea is to get these kids hands-on experience on a film set, to get them their first IMDB credit, and to give them their first professional connections so they can begin to cultivate their professional network.

We hope to make this an annual endeavor, but in order to do that we need this first year to be successful.

I'm posting today because I am looking for contributions to our crowdfunding campaign on Seed & Spark:

[friedathemovie.com](https://friedathemovie.com)

I would love for you to take a look at our campaign, and if moved to do so, to make a contribution - any amount helps. We have two weeks to reach at least 80% of our goal, or we lose what we've raised so far.

Also, since I know redditors to be a clever bunch, if you have any novel ideas on how to ramp up my fundraising, I'm all ears.

Again, this fundraiser benefits a 501(c)(3) called Ripple Effect Artists, and it ultimately benefits some very bright and talented kids.

Cheers,

Victor Gallo"

Hi everyone!

Crisis Text Line is celebrating its 6th birthday tomorrow!

In honor of their 6th birthday and my birthday, I would love to host a fundraiser to benefit Crisis Text Line!

A little information for you: 

As of right now, Crisis Text Line has exchanged 105,986,234 since August 1st, 2013. 

Pennsylvania ranks #35 out of 50 states for suicidal texters, #30 for sexual abuse, #25 for bullying, #22 for depression, #26 for self harm, #18 for substance abuse and #13 for emotional abuse, according to crisistrends.org. 

Crisis Text Line is a free, 24/7 resource for those going through any sort of crisis, whether that be suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety, grief, relationship issues, abuse, domestic violence, and more. 

Unfortunately, not everything is free. This resource is free to all users, but in order to support those in crisis, we are in need of funding. 

A breakdown: 

$19 supports one texter in their time of crisis

$57 supports three texters in their time of crisis

$193 supports one day of technology needed to keep the Crisis Text Line platform up and running. 

$238 supports one hour of supervision on the Platform in times of highest traffic

$580 supports 3 days of technology needed to keep the Crisis Text Line platform up and running

$1,008 supports 30 hours of training for one Crisis Counselor

Of course, any and all donations are beneficial. 

I support Crisis Text Line, as they continue to expand and are now helping our friends in Canada and the United Kingdom, and continue to help those in crisis. 

I understand that not everyone has money right now, and that's okay. Could you share this post if you're unable to donate? I would love to raise $600 for their 6th birthday! 

Thank you <3

They are hunted not only for their meat, which is considered a delicacy, but also for their scales, which is used in traditional medicine, as it is believed to be able to cure cancer, palsy, etc. It is my fear, as well as the fear of many different wildlife conservation organizations that these incredible animals are going to be wiped from the Earth with many people not ever knowing that they existed in their lifetime. I am in no way personally or professionally affiliated with the organizations that I've linked to, or to any others. I just really love these animals and want to spread awareness of them. Conservation efforts are so hard because so few people know, which makes government pressure on poachers weak at best. Please give the organizations that I've linked to a look and donate if you can. Please share even if you can't donate.

,"$13,000 in credit card debt due to medical issues and inability to work","Last year I was forced into a leave of absence from work due to severe recurrent depressive disorder and daily migraines. I've seen multiple doctors, am on 7 meds now, and have had procedures to help with my medical issues. I have finally been able to return to work this past month, but I am on a doctor mandated restricted schedule. Short term disability did not accept my claim because they did not think it was serious enough. There's nothing the state can do for me either because I'm not permanently disabled. I've been trying to do odd jobs and sell things I own to try to get in some extra money, but I'm still unable to meet my bare minimum financial obligations. Any sort of help would be much appreciated.

,New Mexico Community Land Trust launches GoFundMe campaign to create New Agrarian Settlement,"Greetings from Dilia in beautiful New Mexico, where the grass is lush, the birds happy and the honey flowing!

After running the [Gaia Gardens](http://gaiagardens.blogspot.com/2016/12/goodbye-santa-fe.html) urban farm project in Santa Fe, I created the [Mil Abrazos Community Land Trust](https://milabrazoscommunitylandtrust.blogspot.com/p/vision.html), with a mission to create a new form of agrarian settlement.

The place will be a farm with affordable housing, regenerative agriculture, life skills education, land restoration and permaculture education. The education of the youth, as well as aging and eldercare, will be carefully considered in the design of this settlement.

For the past year and a half, I’ve been joyfully building the basecamp from which the settlement will be designed by drawing on the ingenuity and wisdom of our extended community (see [program](https://milabrazoscommunitylandtrust.blogspot.com/p/master-plan-design-for-new-agrarian.html))

I am now seeking to raise $50,000 to finish the basecamp and have just launched a [GoFundMe campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/Mil-Abrazos-Creating-New-Agrarian-Settlement). 

Take a look at the video and campaign story which has plans and budget for the building. 

Please share widely to your social network and help us raise the roof on this project. No donation is too small, it all adds up!

Also, please post comments as they help drive our GoFundMe rating.

Thank you for all your love and support!

,"Need Help Getting Started, Please.","I am interested in going around to a number of local big companies and asking all of them to sponsor just one homeless person in the city. I want them to contribute enough for a thorough mental evaluation (this would be the mandatory first step to be in the program), housing and, as the case may be, medication, as required. (Job search, food, etc.). Just one! We have enough large companies in the area to cover a LOT of people!

But first I would like someone to refer me to a place where someone might be willing to put together a website that would track every single penny that goes in and out of the foundation. Is there already software available for this specifically for non-profits?

At first it will just be me making calls and having meetings but I think it could build little by little.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I'm sure there are a million things that I haven't and wouldn't think of."

,Help pay off the last of my vet bills before my work contract expires,"Hello r/Charity

I come to you in need. As the title implies, I have some money I need to pay back after my cat required surgery earlier this year. I was laid off from my job just before all this and a whole host of other issues came up as well: my car broke down, and the IRS said I owed $700 because TurboTax didn't file my return correctly. Thankfully, I found my current job very quickly but it wasn't without a significant paycut. This job is on a contract and that is up at the end of August. I'm trying to pay back most of this remaining $900 so I can focus on finding another job (I've applied to 30+ places in the last two weeks or so), paying rent, and paying for groceries.

,"My cat was mauled by a pit bull and I can't afford treatment. $1500 would save her life, $4500 would also save her leg. Seeking help, loan, or advice.","Hi friends I haven't met, I'm Adam.  This is a crosspost from r/gofundme, apologies if I'm doing it wrong. 

I woke up yesterday to growling outside my window and found our neighbor's pit bull got into our yard and attacked my cat Kali. I got her to our local animal hospital right away and put my last $500 as a deposit to have her seen, she's roughed up all over, and her front left paw is shattered at the elbow. Our options are to have the vet euthanize for another $1000, perform an amputation for another $1500, or refer me to a surgeon who will charge about 3000 (on top of the vet's fees) to try and save her leg. We got a 2nd opinion on the prices from a friend in the industry and were told that the prices were ""reasonable and competitive"". The dog's owner says he doesn't have that much but that he would contribute what he could and cover the euthanization if necessary.

The reason I can't afford her surgery is that I was laid off a few weeks ago and have no current income. My credit cards are maxed out. I've already applied for Florida Reemployment but they have a ""waiting week"" before I can claim any benefits. I've applied for CareCredit at a friend's suggestion and was denied instantly due to low score and high balance. We tried applying with other members of my family who were also denied instantly. I was already in the process applying for a small loan to start a business, but was rejected for that too.

Kali is being held at the vet's so I don't have a picture with a note with my name on it at this moment, however I will take one at noon when I am allowed to see her. In the meantime I will add proof of purchase for the $500 deposit (minus the name and location of the animal hospital until I get their permission).

A brief glance at this and other subs shows that I'm certainly not the worst off here and I feel guilty as hell even asking for help. I was prepared to make do for a few difficult weeks until things turned back up, but this was sudden and unexpected, and it's not kitty's fault that I'm out of work. If you'd be willing to donate, I will consider it a short term loan and will pay back someday, somehow, with interest.

,Making a post for a friend who needs some help:),"Hey there - We’re currently 26 weeks pregnant with identical twin girls. About 3 weeks ago at a routine appointment, we found out my cervix was shortening dramatically. A normal cervix at this point in pregnancy is 3-4 centimeters and mine is currently measuring at .6 centimeters.  I spent a few days in the hospital, and was put on bedrest for the remainder of the pregnancy. I am at very very high risk for preterm labor. This being said, I am unable to work because of my bedrest. With bills piling up and two babies to prepare for, we’re definitely in need of your help. Unfortunately, the state of Iowa does not offer any type of short term disability assistance for pregnant women on bedrest. Any donations would mean the world to me, and would be more than helpful after losing half our income. 

Thank you for taking the time to read our story,

,A Hike for Dignity: Thru-Hiking the Appalachian Trail for the Alzheimer's Association and National Hospice Foundation,"The population of the United States over the age of 65 is projected to double by 2050, from 43.1 million to 83.7 million based on recent censuses data characterizing the current and potential growth of American demographics. This expected increase will be driven by the aging Baby Boomer Generation combined with the continued improvement of bio-medical technology inherently increasing average lifespan, and the number of complex and chronic illness individuals can live with. As the senior population in the United States grows, so will the demand for costly and resource-intensive care. As of 2014, Medicare spending has been heavily concentrated towards the end-of-life, with most of that spending on the in-patient and intensive care setting.

In 2011, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) identified the leading causes of death in the US to include chronic lower respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, infection-related pneumonia and sepsis, and chronic liver disease. Many of these leading causes of death can result in long term hospital stays with costly and invasive treatment. As the number of Americans seeking out long term care for chronic and terminal conditions increases, increase demand for hospice and palliative medicine is also expected. This increase is predicted based on the already rapid growth in the market and changes in cultural attitudes towards the specialty in recent years.

This Spring (2020), I will be embarking to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail. The Appalachian Trail is a 2,190-mile foot-trail that winds its way up from Georgia, across North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and finally ending in Maine. My hike will be on behalf of the National Hospice Foundation and the American Alzheimer’s Association. These two non-profits have dedicated their efforts to improve the comfort, safety, and dignity patients and their families are treated with, leading to and at the end-of-life.

This campaign’s goal will be to raise $4,380, that’s $2,190 (the length of the Appalachian Trail) for both the National Hospice Foundation and the American Alzheimer’s Association. Donations will be accepted as pledges. You can choose to pledge, $0.01, $0.02, $0.04, or $0.05 per mile. Any donation is appreciated and will help to continue championing this cause. All funds will be donated 50/50 to the two charities at the end of the hike. All donors will receive direct confirmation that their funds arrived at these non-profits.

Below is the link to the PledgeIt campaign if you or a loved-one is interested in donating. Please note, upon making a pledge, you will owe nothing immediately aside from a small service fee. All pledges will be collected at the end of the thru-hike.

,Fail!Dog from r/Funny (in 2013) now has Fractured Leg and Needs Surgery,"Six years ago, Crom went mildly viral on the internet for failing to catch his favorite orange ball while his mom took pictures.

He did well on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1hq8si/dog_not_catching_a_ball/), though his mom no longer has an account. From there, Crom also ended up on other parts of the internet, including in some lists of best photos of dog humiliating themselves trying to catch their balls. That's the cover page on his [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/faildog).

Playing fetch is still his absolute favorite, but about two months ago, Crom tripped on uneven earth while running after his ball and fractured one of his little legs. Now Crom can no longer run and must be [wheeled out in a cart for his bathroom breaks](https://i.imgur.com/ArsS6GC.jpg).

Surgery to fix his fracture and let him run again, as well as live without pain, is  $6K and not financially viable for his family. They have been turned down for credit, and could really use some help in getting Crom back on all four of his feet. I'm a friend of the family but all money will be going to them, and here are my [proof photos](http://imgur.com/gallery/a4k8jP1), taken over Crom's grumblings.

,Help my fix our septic tank,"I live with my mum and sister. My mum's been a single parent with depression and did her best to raise us. She never treats herself and got a tough job as a care worker looking after elderly folks. Bathing them, cleaning their room/house, medical stuff. Real dehumanising work at times.

No matter how much she saves, our house is ageing and it constantly needs repairs or replacements. Our septic tank is probably the most essential thing in the house thats barely functioning. It won't drain excess water, so when it rains, as it does a lot here in every season, we can't flush the toilet or shower or anything. It'll be a big cost to fix, currently we have had to dig a hole to reach the outlet for it and when the hole fills up with water (full of decaying pee and poo), scoop it out with a bucket. We did this for over 2 years.

I bought a cheap pump to do the job temporarily but it broke, so I got another one that works but will struggle in winter. So it needs fixed and we can't afford it, I've just finished uni but having a hard time getting enough money saved from my pizza job until i get a better job, which could be a year. For my mum, sister and myself, anything at all would be one step closer to sorting all this (literal) shit out.

,Help our rescue puppy beat parvovirus,"[Gofundme for Piper](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rescue-our-rescue-pup)

HELP PIPER BEAT PARVO!!

Our family adopted sweet Piper less than a week ago from a rescue in central California - now she and all of her siblings are in critical care for Parvovirus, fighting for their life! We are doing everything we can to save this sweet little girl, but it’s really taking a toll on my family, emotionally and financially!!

Puppies with parvovirus don't show signs of being sick until about 10-15 days after being exposed to the virus.
The rescue is doing their best to help, but sadly they only have limited funds. One puppy sadly had to be put down because the owners ran out of funds 😞

Please share our story and donate if you can 🌟

,Help an Inner-City teacher fight a brain tumor.,"She has a tumor which was predicted to not cause her harm for years, but it switched on one day this June and is causing major disability. For the past two years, she has gone about her life as normally as she could while hiding the knowledge that she was privately struggling with limitations and uncertainty regarding when to undergo brain surgery. She has been quietly living with the tumor in hopes that it would not grow or cause more issues while trying to save funds and minimize the financial impact for future surgery. She has been actively participating in medical therapies to consistently compensate for the symptoms and receiving the best achievable medical care from nurses, doctors, and therapists in her home state. https://www.gofundme.com/f/SupportKathleenSmith"

,Dear Jack Foundation - $300K Challenge to provide quality of life programming for young adult & adolescent cancer patients survivors and their families.,"Links:

[To Donate](https://give.dearjackfoundation.org/team/236228) (leave a little ""reddit"" in the comment section so we know where you came from!)

[FAQ About Foundation](https://www.dearjackfoundation.org/faqs/)

The Dear Jack Foundation is a 501(c)(3) Charitable Organization. Tax ID 45-2219082 

&#x200B;

I am fundraising on behalf of the [Dear Jack Foundation](http://www.dearjackfoundation.org/) and to raise awareness for the issues facing adolescent and young adults affected by cancer.  


**Background:** Adolescent and young adults are at a unique stage in their emotional, cognitive, and social development, which cancer often disrupts. The attempts by these young adults to establish independence from their parents, to complete school, to enter the workforce with a desired career, to find a life partner, and to raise a family often are temporarily, or somethings permanently derailed, leading to feelings of isolation and depression.  


***""This is not a generation in search of pity; we are searching for action. We have so much to offer this world, and we are ready for the world to meet us on our journeys through treatment, recovery and survival. With your support we can make this possible.""*** \- Andrew McMahon, DJF Founder 

&#x200B;

My team, Chalk Hearts,  are set out to raise $10,000 (and beyond - we are already just over $7,500!) by 11/11/19! The money raised will go to serve the Adolescent & Young Adult cancer community. The Dear Jack Foundation programs such as the Life List program & Breathe Now Wellness retreat for patients and their caretakers help to serve this underfunded community. 

Did you know that -

•Young adults get entirely different cancers than other age groups.

•The reasons why young adults get are entirely different than that of other age groups.

•Clinical trial participation in young adults is lower than other age groups.

•There is currently no “young adult cancer clinical research.”

•Funding traditional cancer research will most likely not help a young adult with cancer.

Our dad, René Utrera, is currently in a delicate state since July 22th, where he suffered a heart attack in the city of Caracas - Venezuela, where he almost lost his life.  


On July 23, an emergency intervention was carried out, where a catheterization was performed and hi is kept in the ICU due to his delicate state of health. His closest family is outside of Venezuela and we cannot visit him since we have  expired documents.  


This heart attack is complex in nature and requires multiple operations and medical treatments, which cause costs that can not be paid only with the family resources, hence why we are asking for help from anyone who is willing to give it.   


We require your best support to help us in order to keep our father with us.

,Raising funds for my 6 year old niece’s family to live off of while she recovers from invasive open heart surgery (GoFundMe),"[Dena’s Dollars](https://www.gofundme.com/f/1pbrmbedtc?sharetype=teams&member=2600404&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&rcid=9077566e338841359053e7fa709b0371) was started to aid my sister and her husband while they’re caring for my six year old niece.

Dena was born with a congenital heart defect, requiring her to have open heart surgery throughout the course of her life. She had one when she was an infant, and her next round is scheduled this week, six years after her first surgery.

This is an invasive open heart surgery, and carries risks. As you could imagine, this is a very stressful time for our whole family, especially De’s parents.

They’ll be taking some time off work after the surgery to care for her, and as such, won’t have an income.

I’m trying to raise funds for them to live off while they’re off work. Bills don’t stop coming, and groceries don’t become free just because you don’t have an income.

And little bit would help our family quite a bit.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

,Go Fund Me for 25 week micropreemie.,"Hello all. I am wanting to share this Go Fund Me that me sister-in-law created for my wife and I. My wife got pregnant with our first child in November. In April, she had to be taken to the hospital to be checked out due to headaches and general feeling of illness. Turns out she had a severe case of preeclampsia. Our baby was 25 weeks old. Two days after going to the hospital, the OBGYN delivered our baby via cesarean. Our little guy has so far spent 85 days in the NICU, most of it on a ventilator. He still has a while to go before we can even think of bringing him home. 

My sister-in-law created this Go Fund Me to help with some of the medical expenses involved. This will also help to allow my wife take some time off work to bond with our child. She unfortunately cannot take temporary disability for bonding with our child, as it is not deemed a medical necessity, and used all of her sick and vacation when our child was born. It is likely our son will need medical care long after he comes home.  We would appreciate anyone who could share this Go Fund Me in their social media circles. If this is not appropriate to post, please let me know and I can remove it.

,I need help,"In more ways than one... here's the story. (TLDR at bottom)

&#x200B;

I have struggled with depression for like 5 years now. I've attempted suicide before, and it's not fun. I've been feeling really low lately, and I was working as a chef for a place where people live for like 2 months to get on our program and detox. We have a medical team on sight and all that, it's basically a mental health facility with some extra kicks. My best friend messaged me one day and told me that she was cutting me out of her life. She is a nurse where I worked. I asked for an explanation and she wouldn't give me one, nor even dignify me with a talk on the phone or in person, just a cold text, and then she expected me to stay away from her. I have no idea what i did to her, but it really tore me up. I went down the rabbit hole, and was planning to take my life. I know it seems dramatic, but I have been wanting to die for a while now anyways, this just kinda pushed me to the edge. I told another coworker that I was having these thoughts and was planning this. They told some higher ups, and before you know it this personal conversation I was having with a coworker about my depression and suicidal thoughts turned into me being suspended from work, until they can evaluate my mental health. They wanted to get me help, because I was really struggling. I met with my boss and some HR reps and they were very generous and understanding, I explained what sent me over the edge and all that and they wanted to help, they said they would pay me for the week I was suspended, pay for my first month of therapy sessions, and get me back on track. I went back in a couple days later to finalize everything, which is when they told me I was fired.  I was really confused how quick it changed, but the (ex) best friend I mentioned earlier, who cut me out for no reason? She lied to HR and told them I was sexually harassing her. WTF. I have never sexually harassed anyone, I have no idea what I did to make her suddenly hate me so much enough to get me fired....so, they gave me my last paycheck, which was only a couple hundred dollars, and sent me on my way. I'm absolutely devastated. I don't have a job, I don't have money for rent which is due on the first, and I'm struggling right now just to find the desire to live. I really don't want to go through this, I would rather just leave (if you catch my drift)....I don't know what to do. I have put out applications, but nothing is happening fast enough and if I don't figure out how to come up with $1,000 by the first I will also be homeless - my apartment complex wastes no time with that stuff, they evict you 24 hours after you fail to pay rent. I know because they already tried to evict me once due to a mix up that was their own fault. I feel so cornered right now, and so much pressure to go out and get things taken care of but I don't know how, and I don't even feel like getting out of bed...Do you guys have any suggestions? I just need to get through the next couple weeks, it was all too short notice for me to take care of it in time. Friends and family can't/won't help, and they live 2,000 miles away. I moved across the country last year to try and find myself. If I could somehow reach out to people about my situation who can help, and get enough to pay my rent, I can then have enough time and relief to gather myself and get back on my feet. Please, if there's any way you can help please tell me

&#x200B;

TLDR; Got fired for something I didn't do, really put me down as I already struggle with pretty severe suicidal depression, and now I am suddenly jobless, almost broke, and have like 10 days to come up with $1,000 for rent or be evicted. Need help"

,"Help save hungry, hurt and homeless cats and dogs","My name is Godwin, I am a vet from Ghana. Coming home to Ghana after many years away and seeing the problem of the enormously overpopulated stray feral cats and dogs and a rabies epidemic underway in most parts of the rural areas. A high number of stray dog bites are recorded out of which averagely 24 were positive for rabies. I decided to create a no-kill NGO to reduce suffering in Ghana and advocate humane behaviour by providing rescue, rehabilitation, and sanctuary to abandoned, neglected and abused dogs.

Sancore rescue is full to the brim with dogs and many more pouring through the doors. Dogs that will be left for dead or euthanized if we do not take them in. To be able to take more cats and dogs in, we need to be able to pay for the veterinary bills that come along with them. To get these dogs in a healthy state and ready for adoption costs a lot of money and we want to make sure that these furry babies are given every chance they deserve by getting as much funding as we can.

All money raised will be for Sancore animal rescue and shelter which desperately needs help right now. We are a registered non-profit organization that does fantastic work saving many animals every year. This rescue organization will put every single dollar received to great use saving as many dogs live as possible. Proof of transfer receipts will be posted on social media so you can see exactly where your donation has gone. I want to give the rescue the best chance possible of saving as many cats and dogs as possible. I would be incredibly grateful for any donations that you can spare to help cats and dogs get out of the shelter and into warm and loving homes.

Abandoned, abused and injured, countless sweet senior and special-needs cats and dogs some torn from the only homes they have known and placed in cages to await probable euthanasia.  However, with your help, many of these animals can have a second chance.  Sancore animal rescue and shelter a dedicated NGO prevents these cats and dogs from the kill lists, provide vital veterinary medical care, and place them in warm and welcoming foster and forever homes.

These poor street cats and dogs struggle to find food and search for a safe place to sleep. They will never know what it is like to be petted, snuggled and loved. They must battle to find food to stay alive. They must be hoping for help. No one is coming to help them.

 I will do everything I can to help these poor furry babies. I am trying to make a difference in their lives. I cannot do this alone, I need your help. I have dedicated my future into helping these animals.

Donations are needed to help fund the enormous project that I am taking on single-handedly.  Feeding is a daily expense that is ongoing. Veterinary visits, surgeries and medication add up fast. Every dollar counts, no amount is too small. Please help give them a small chance at sleeping without the pain of hunger, and help prevent the birthing of so many unwanted puppies and kittens.

Please dig deep to help these special cats and dogs, and share/like/ on social media.  Many thanks.

[Jack’s picture with username attached ](https://imgur.com/gallery/PLlQWUT)


Posting on behalf of my friend who isn’t super familiar with Reddit. 

Jack is a 1 year old kitty who needs some help. He lives in a home with two other cats and they get along great. We believe the cats were playing and things got out of hand and this is how his jaw became broken. We are not 100% sure of what happened though. My friend already had CareCredit but is only approved for $500. The estimates we have received around were we live (central Indiana) are looking to be around $4,400. She is a 20 year old college student and is already strapped for cash. She is moving into her own apartment for the first time next month and wasn’t expecting any of this of course. The vet clinic we have been dealing with said they need at-least $2,800 upfront and the rest of the money when picking him up.

We will be calling another vet clinic tomorrow a few hours away to see if they can do the surgery cheaper but that is currently unknown. With this being his jaw broken this is of course very time sensitive with him not being able to drink or eat. Anything helps."

,"My boyfriend's father has recently passed away after a long battle with cancer, his and children need some support right now","https://www.gofundme.com/f/morrills?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=fb_co_campmgmt_m


The funeral and burial has already been covered, they are looking for donations to help get through the grieving period.


They were unable to work for about two weeks because in Mike's final weeks he needed 24/7 care as he was set up at home in hospice. These donations help with rent, utilities, food, and everything else that this family needs to survive.

I did not know Mike for very long but in the short time I knew him it was very apparent that he was a good man and a good father. He hid his pain very well up until those final weeks when he couldn't anymore.


He cultivated such a large, wonderful family that has welcomed me with open arms. I have never seen so many people at a funeral. I seriously love this family so much, my heart is very heavy for them. I'm doing all that I can to help and support them but unfortunately I am not in a financial position to do more.


On top of everything, Mike's only daughter had to be rushed to the hospital just a few days after he passed due to a kidney infection. The family is now scrambling to cover this cost as well.


Please consider donating or sharing this wherever you can, everything helps.


Thank you ❤"

He also has G6PD deficiency and can only drink an expensive kind of formula (HIPP). Unfortunately baby Sean's parents are poor, live in the slums, and are unable to pay for his medical needs. His mother works in a small road-side canteen, and his father is unemployed and cannot work because he is taking care of Sean full time. Sometimes for extra income, his mother asks her boss if she could take some food from the canteen and sell them to the hospital staff at night after her work. Unfortunately the money she earns from that is only enough for her and her husband's food for the day. Most of the time they do not have enough money to buy Sean's special formula and has no choice but to feed him regular milk, which Sean later on vomits and his lips swell due to his G6PD deficiency.

,Heart Worm Treatment for Stray,"      On Sunday, July 7, 2019 my family and I were driving home when we discovered two adult dogs and six puppies eating from a bag of dog food dumped on the side of our street. Someone had abandoned these sweet animals in the middle of the woods. As soon as we stopped to help these poor dogs, all of them scattered into the brush- except for the white terrier mix  we dubbed “Mama”, as we realized the puppies belonged to her. Mama stuck by my husband’s and my side the entire afternoon as we combed through the woods to find her missing puppies and companion. 
     By Sunday evening, Mama and three of her puppies, as well as her companion, were safely at our house.  All of the dogs were infested with intestinal parasites along with being covered in fleas and ticks. Despite having such uncomfortable ailments, Mama was a sweet and gentle soul. She loved behind the ear scratches and begged for belly rubs. It was a bittersweet feeling when Animal Control came Monday afternoon to bring the dogs to the Humane Society. My family and I knew the Prattville/Autauga Humane Society (PAHS) were these special animals’ [Go Fund Me](GoFundMe.com/heart-worm-treatment-for-mama)only chance at living a healthy and happy life, but still had already formed a special place in our hearts for Mama. 
     Unfortunately, we have learned from the Humane Society that Mama is sick with heart worms. PAHS is a nonprofit organization that works tirelessly to rehabilitate sick and needy animals and find them “furever” homes. Because the Prattville/Autauga Humane Society has limited funds available and a lengthy list of animals already receiving care, Mama needs our help to access lifesaving heart worm treatment!

However, we all have a part of ourselves we want to change.  Mine is my teeth.  I wish I could say there is some real reason for them to need gum therapy, but there isn't.  I had a rough time in my life a few years back and this past year, I've fought back against my PTSD and depression.

I gathered my courage and went to the dentist today.  It was $225 for a consult and a visit.  I was told I need gum therapy for gum disease.  

I asked if there was any way I could pay in payments and if it was going to be a lot.

Well..they don't accept payments directly to them and i would have to get a sort of medical credit card.  

Oh, and the procedure is $1350.  

Oh again, if I don't do it within a few years, I could lose my teeth.

I make roughly $1200 a month teaching kids.  This isn't a type of teaching job where I get healthcare.  

So I'm coming to this place to pray for a miracle.

Anything would help and if this gets accomplished, I get rid of a part of me that I've been humiliated by for most of my life.

,Please help me cover my cat (Panda)'s lifesaving surgery costs.,"Pet Pic w/ Reddit Acct/ Vet Bill/ Surgery pics/ Baby pic:

[https://imgur.com/a/QIrxAuy](https://imgur.com/a/QIrxAuy)

SUMMARY:

I am a 27F college student, doing what I can otherwise to make sure that he gets the care he needs, but I guess I'm also just asking for a little help. Last Tuesday, I brought my cat, Panda, who is only 4 years old into the vet because he was unable to urinate. He had to undergo two surgeries (remove the penis, which didn't work; so they cut open his bladder), numerous catheterizations, requiring anesthesia, antibiotics, pain meds, and bloodwork, and now requires a special diet for the rest of his life. These expenses came as a major surprise, (as they always do) and of course, there is never a good time for a major surprise like this. I don't expect others to take responsibility for the care of my pet, but a few close friends suggested creating a campaign because they wanted to help. I am creating this because I know that sometimes we all need to accept help when it is offered, especially when it comes to caring for those who depend on us and trust us to care for them as Panda has trusted me. I knew there would be some cost, taking him to the vet, but I had no idea the complications we were facing. At this point, every dollar they ask for is money I don't have, and every dollar that can help is money Panda and I are truly grateful for. 

Thank you guys so much for reading, sharing, contributing, or even just well-wishes to hope he heals up. I will pay it forward in the future.

UPDATE:

They called this morning and said he could come home today. So, I just got back from picking him up at the vet. He ate like he was starving and is now knocked out on the couch in his cone. But, this is what I was hit with.

I ended up having to pay $2796.92 in total... $2731.01 of which I put on care credit (which I can't really afford to do, but I had to open a line of credit, which is also now immediately maxed out) and they require me to pay it off within 6 months or they will charge me 26.99% interest on the entire amount borrowed from the start. Even with the amount that others have donated, (I have to wait for it to be credited to me from GFM) now that I put the initial amount on care credit, it's going to hurt big if I don't pay it off within six months. Which is $455.16 a month... OR... the interest added to the loan will be an additional $737.09 + more accrued interest if I can't pay it down quickly after that either. I should be in a better financial position soon, and I'm gonna put in a lot of work the next few months just to cover these costs, but I'm just hoping I can help get that pay off amount down before I face an additional thousand for his care.

(I understand that my situation might make people less likely to help me... being that he already received the care, and it may seem like 6 months is plenty of time, but an extra $455 a month is hard to come by especially now that he requires a special diet to prevent this from happening again). so I at least ask that you guys don't downvote my post or comments, at the very least.. it was hard enough to ask for help without being made to feel ashamed for it. Just scroll past and shake your head if you must.

&#x200B;

TLDR;

SUMMARY; Just a 27F college student, trying to save her cat. Panda was unable to urinate, required two surgeries, and was under the vet's care for the last 7 days. I've had him since I first rescued him and his mother, and the rest of her litter during a flood season 4 yrs ago. He is my best friend. Asking for help, as hard as it is to let go of my pride, because I had to do what's best for Panda.

UPDATE; I was able to cover the cost of care by opening a new credit line at the vet's clinic. 26.99% interest rate if not paid off in 6 months. $2797.92 Total bill. $2731.01 total balance on card. ($455/mo at that rate.) I just really need help getting the initial cost down so I can lower the monthly payments. Will pay it forward. Please don't downvote.

,Trouble paying for medicine and car insurance.,"I've been trying to avoid doing this for nine months since my father passed away in October of last year. It's gotten to the point that I'm about to hit a dead end. For the past 15 years I lived with my parents to take care of them as they were both very sick. This caused a lot of stress on me and eventually led to a stress ulcer forming into a perforation of my colon in 2016 causing it to rupture and send me into septic shock and keitoacidosis with a blood sugar of 725, now I'm a diabetic with a load of other issues. Peripheral neuropathy, Retinopathy. I was diagnosed with chron's disease and recently something called Spondylosis which are calcium deposits in the cartilage of my spine.

As you can imagine I've started applying for disability but have been denied twice because of my age (I'm only 33) and have been receiving medical help and mental therapy, with the aid of a lawyer to fix this with no avail.

Now what money I'd saved up has been harshly depleted with my mothers passing in March, with funeral and cremation costs. So now I can no longer afford to pay my car insurance and phone bill, along with affording things like my mental medications, chrons medications and diabetic supplies like my testing strips, insulin pens, and metformin. Not to mention definitely not being able to afford the anti-inflammatory for my spondylosis.

So if you can help me by any means I pray the universe blesses your kindness and if you can give me some tips on what I can do for finances any advice is welcome.

,Help for an Amazing Mother that desperately needs it,"My name is Kristen and a year ago I had the pleasure to meet and hire Loretta Mackenzie. She is the most wonderful human being but has had a rough couple of years.  Her husband Benton was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and with no  cure in sight, the couple researched other methods of pain treatment. Finding medical marijuana was the first relief he had found in years.  About 6 years ago her house was raided by police and she, her husband, and their son were arrested and charged with felonies for growing marijuana to use as an oil to treat her husband's cancer.  The police were on a witch hunt from the beginning. They were put in jail and her husband suffered without treatment, eventually passing away. Fast forward to this year, her husband is gone, her and her son moved to Arizona in a lot of debt (medical bills, posting bail, etc), and are living paycheck to paycheck in a trailer park in a dangerous part of town. Loretta walks a total of 4 miles in the 110 degree Arizona summer heat to the bus stop to get to work every day. She has never complained and puts in 100% effort every single day. She sold her car shortly after moving to afford a place to live. Every day is a struggle and she has been through enough in her life. Her son is all she has left. I want to raise money for her to buy a car, or at the very least, help her with bills for a while. Anything you donate would help her and I would be forever grateful. Loretta is the type of person you can talk to and you are always left with a smile on your face. She likes to garden, fish, and cook. She is a Mom at heart, even if not blood related. She has spent her life taking care of others; its time someone put her first and took care of her. She's a hard working woman and deserves a break, however big  we can give her.

,Do you get frustrated when people lecture you for giving?,"I was walking to my counselling appointment with my grandma, and I noticed a homeless person in a wheelchair. I heard him asking people if they have spare change. Since I had time to kill before my appointment and a lot of disposable income left, I decided to buy him a sandwich and a coffee.

However, after we left, my grandma gave me a lecture about how the homeless person must not really be homeless because he’s disabled. In the UK we have a system for disabled people called PIP. My grandma thinks that the guy must have a lot of money because of this system. However, the government have taken cuts toward this system, so much so that those who have no legs or arms are being declared as not needing PIP. Therefore, I felt my grandma was wrong. Now, she keeps asking me if I have my purse and all my belongings, all because I interacted with a homeless person.

We did plan for the one baby we meant to have; no one in either of our families has had twins and we didn’t use any fertility treatments, so there was no way we could have expected we’d become pregnant with 2 at once.

Starting next week, myself and several other Northeastern University students will be heading to Cape Town, South Africa as part of program focused on social entrepreneurship and improving economic opportunity in the city. 

Since the program starts so soon, I figured why not post something here!

We will be working with local South African business students to support the developing entrepreneurs with their businesses by helping write business plans, creating websites, and assisting with financial planning. This program also includes a service week to support education initiatives and children's programs within townships.

As we will be working with and learning from charities in Cape Town, we will also be donating to these charities to assist their efforts in benefiting their local communities. We hope to fundraise $10,000 before the start of the program on July 10th.

[Make a donation](https://www.northeastern.edu/huskystarter/project/social-enterprise-institute/).

Charities that will benefit from these funds include:

* **Christel House** – From early childhood stages to early adulthood, they help educate, feed and provide health care to children. To learn more about Christel House, click [here](https://sa.christelhouse.org/).

,GoFundMe closed my friend's account and campaign without warning and refuse to say why they did it,"One of my online friends has been badly needing to move to a new urban environment and since she's extremely low on funds she decided to make a GoFundMe campaign to help get some donations so she can move and improve her life. A few days after doing so however, [GoFundMe closed her account and her campaign and refunded the people that donated to her.](https://twitter.com/chelc_txt/status/1144742131405402112) In an email sent to her from this, one particular bit of wording stood out ""While we can't share the specific reasons for this action, if you believe it was in error and you're willing to provide us with more information about yourself and your campaign, please reply to this email and attach a clear picture of your government-issued photo ID""

So she did this

This Monday she received a new, even more baffling email in response to her doing this, [saying that they won't reopen her account and refuse to clarify why](https://twitter.com/chelc_txt/status/1145723257989058560). Specifically, the wording is:

""We've reviewed your GoFundMe account again and confirmed that we are unable to process donations for it. Your GoFundMe account and any associated campaigns will remain closed. **We are also unable to share the reasons for this action**""

Basically, a donation service the poor and needy depend on that handles peoples MONEY, can close someone's campaign seemingly at random without telling anyone why?

**GOFUNDME CAN CLOSE YOUR CAMPAIGN AND ACCOUNT AND REFUSE TO TELL YOU WHY OR WHAT YOU DID WRONG**

Can anyone tell me what the hell is up with this? Has this happened to anyone else, and is there anything that my friend can do?

,Out of work for 2 months while recovering from breaking both my feet.,"Hi there r/charity! I recently had an accident that resulted in me breaking both of my feet. I fractured three metatarsals and damaged a ligament in my left food and I fractured one metatarsal in my right foot. I'll be having surgery on one or both feet in about two weeks and will be recovering for about 8 weeks after that. 

I'm a recent college grad and have only been working at my current job for a month (thankfully I'll have that job to go back to after I recover) so my savings is not exactly equipped to deal with this kind of situation. My family isn't able to help a lot right now because they have their own various and assorted debts and will be more focused on helping me with the medical bills when they come in. Luckily, I'm on my parents health insurance and have an aunt that works in insurance billing and can help me get assistance paying the bills themselves. In the immediate moment I'm concerned about making sure I have money to cover my basic expenses so I can worry less about that and more about getting better.

Right now my goal is set at $2k to cover two months worth of rent, utilities, car insurance, cat food, and then some extra for groceries/misc expenses. Any extra funds raised will go towards paying off medical bills. Also! I'm a cartoonist and illustrator and would love to make some artwork as thanks for donations, so feel free to message me if you'd like a little drawing. I'm also available for straight up commission work since I'm not exactly busy going to work.

,Health Costs Due to Lyme Disease,"I  have had Lyme Disease for over 15 years now and it has gotten to the  point where it is manageable with certain medications.  Somehow I  graduated college while sick but have been pretty useless for a number  of years.

I am able to work part time  now but, unfortunately, I make below the minimum wage to get a tax  subsidy towards my health insurance costs (obamacare).  I am now paying  $450 a month just for the premium.   I only make about $850 a month  after taxes.  A car payment and insurance plus living costs make this  unsustainable.

If I had even $50-100 a  month more I should be able to keep going into debt.   Handouts are not  something I really like asking for but I'm pretty desperate and never  have done something like this before.

,Walking the length of Britain for Alzheimers Research UK,"Hello good people of Reddit!   


My names Elliott and I have decided to start a fundraiser in which I will be walking from John O'Groats to Lands end.

Some time ago now, my Grandmother, Marj, was diagnosed with arterial disease and vascular dementia. Seeing the way it affects her, and my mum  who is her sole carer, has prompted me to begin this fundraiser.  

Currently 850,000 people are estimated to be living with Dementia in  the UK, with 1 in 5 adults viewing Dementia as an inevitable part of  getting older. It isn't. It can be prevented. More research needs to  done to find the definitive causes of the illness and more research  needs to be done to find effective treatments and a possible cure.    


I need your help!  


In order to generate more exposure, and so that you guys can stay up to  date with my progress, I will document the entire journey on YouTube and  Instagram in a series called ""Are we there yet?"". If the series is to  generate some traction, and YouTube decide to monetize the channel, **any and all** ad revenue will also be donated to Alzheimer's Research UK. I seek no financial gain **whatsoever**.   


I have already raised £200 in cash donations, which is good going as I literally started this whole thing yesterday.  


Here is my GoFundMe: [https://www.gofundme.com/f/walking-the-length-of-britain-for-aruk&rcid=r01-156152432761-25305ddb0564474e&pc=ot\_co\_campmgmt\_w](https://www.gofundme.com/f/walking-the-length-of-britain-for-aruk&rcid=r01-156152432761-25305ddb0564474e&pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w)  


Any and all donations are great! Even if you can't donate, spreading the message and helping me gain more exposure is equally as helpful.

Thanks so much in advance!

> A very close friend of mine (I am leaving her name out of this for safety reasons) is a victim of extreme domestic abuse. She is trying to leave this horrible situation she is in, but will have many expenses in order to do so, such as travel and relocation fees. Her husband has controlled every aspect of her life so she does not have much help or money to leave and start over. Her struggle is far from over, but she needs to make this first step in order to overcome everything she has been through for the last few years. This has been an overwhelming and debilitating experience for her and those who love her. Unfortunately, she can’t properly focus on herself and overcoming all of this until she can get out of her current living situation. And as we all know, moving is expensive and not easy, especially under these types of conditions.

,My fiancée has some emergency dental problems that need to be addressed ASAP (x-post from /r/GoFundMe),"Hello everyone,

About two months ago, my fiancée started having some very, very serious dental problems.

She’s had to simultaneously deal with her wisdom teeth coming in as well as a blocked sinus cavity, which is causing her tremendous pain and forcing her to take a lot of medication. I’ve seen her literally thrash in pain that she described as “worse than childbirth.”

Insurance is taking way too long to approve the surgeries she needs, and a lot of dentists in our area won’t even accept her insurance. We’ve been in ER after ER, and she’s been on antibiotics after antibiotics and pain killers after pain killers. I’ve had to take a lot of time off work to help her; so much so that my job won’t pay for anymore days off. We simply can’t wait any longer or they’ll have to pull her teeth, which I know will devastate her.

I’ve created [this GoFundMe campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/my-fiancees-emergency-dental-medical-cost&rcid=r01-156101658519-03a53418432c4557&pc=ot_co_campmgmt_m) in a last ditch effort to get her the help she needs. All the n all, we need about $2,000 to cover her medical bills out of pocket. No one should suffer like she has simply because of money, so any donation helps.

,Help my Brother and his Wife Afford Medical bills After their Daughter was Born Early at 28 Weeks,"TL/DR: Niece was born at just under 28 weeks. She will remain hospitalized for up to 8 weeks. Asking for financial assistance and well wishes for my brother's family. 

""My beautiful wife was 26 weeks pregnant, when on a routine trip to visit family in Wisconsin, she experienced abnormal swelling in her arms and legs, with high blood pressure. She was taken to urgent care and admitted to a hospital, diagnosed with pre-eclampsia with severe features. Ultrasounds revealed that our baby was not getting the blood flow and nutrition that she needed to grow at a normal rate. 

The hospital my wife was at was not able to provide the care that  premature babies delivered before 36 weeks old need, so she was transported by ambulance 2 hours away to Madison, Wi. 

Upon arrival, her diagnosis was confirmed and was admitted to Meriter hospital. Due to the nature of pre-eclampsia, the doctors could not let my wife travel back to Connecticut where we currently live in fear of needing to do an emergency C-section. Instead, they confined her to the hospital room with constant monitoring.

The plan, if everything stayed stable, was to have my wife stay in the hospital for 8 weeks, and induce labor at 34 weeks. However, the blood flow and nutrition to our baby worsened within the first two weeks, and for the safety of my wife and our baby we had to do a C-section at 27 weeks and 6 days into the pregnancy.

I am so proud to say that the C-section went well, and at 10:10am on June 9th, 2019, we welcomed our daughter Nora. Nora was born just over 12 weeks early. She was only 12 inches long and weighed a mere 1 pound, 11 ounces.

Due to her lack of time in the womb to develop, Nora has been admitted to the NICU with an expected stay of 6-8weeks, barring any complications. 

Physically, and emotionally, this has been exhausting.. and far from the ideal birth plan we had in mind. 

As you all know, with extensive medical care comes extensive medical bills. From the $3500 ambulance bill, to all of the hospital in-patient bills, and the yet to come NICU bills, we are already over our heads. On top of this, we have the weekly airline tickets and car rentals for me to get back and forth between Connecticut and Wisconsin for work, and to be with my family.

We are asking for any financial assistance that can be provided. Anything helps! we greatly appreciate and thank you for the generosity in advance! 

Thank You

Matt, Melissa and Baby Nora""

I've included the link to their GoFundMe below. I've never asked internet strangers for this type of assistance so if this is against any sub rules I won't be butt hurt if it's deleted.

,Looking for any help for a separated family,"Hello everyone I am posting this in hopes to help push a campaign close to me to help my family friends who have been separated from their child for almost 2 years . Here is a copy of their information below. The campaign is being run by a Church the family attends - for any businesses looking to donate I believe it is tax deductible through them since funds are going directly to the church then to the necessary parties. Thanks to any and everyone who is willing to listen and possibly help - your prayers are welcome and appreciated.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/Bring-Oliver-Home-The-Bells-Story

""The thought of losing a child is every parent’s nightmare, and for some, that nightmare has come with a devastating twist of injustice. Far too many families’ parental rights are being severed as their children with previously undiagnosed bone fragility diseases are taken into state custody on allegations of abuse and neglect. 

As the family of Eden Village Church, we are rallying alongside our dear friends, Aaron and Hannah Bell. They are currently fighting to bring their 21-month-old son, Oliver, home after being separated for over a year and a half. In September of 2017, the Bells took their then 3-month-old son to the hospital with a high fever. A scan would reveal fractures in Oliver’s body, and he was immediately taken into state custody.

Since that day, the Bells have advocated, prayed, and faithfully participated in every legal requirement outlined by the court. In an effort to determine the cause of the fractures, Aaron and Hannah sought advanced medical consultation and have both been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), a genetic collagen disorder that is linked to infant bone fractures. The details of the diagnosis and its implications in regards to Oliver’s health will be heard by the court in the coming months, and we have great hope that the diagnosis of this well-documented condition will play a key role in the reunification of Oliver with his parents. 

Throughout this process, we have quickly learned that while the Bells' battle is heartbreaking, their story is not unprecedented. Hundreds of families have been separated due to allegations of neglect and abuse due to previously undiagnosed bone fragility diseases, Vitamin-D deficiencies and its effects in utero and infancy, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, and the full spectrum of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. The ripple effect of your financial donation will not only aid in bringing Oliver home, but will also serve to shed light on the broader injustice faced by families seeking restoration after wrongful separation. Ultimately, our prayer is that as we see redemption unfold in the Bells' story, we will see other families restored as well. 

Your giving immediately helps the Bell family and will provide a foundation for others to become aware of the larger problem many families, like this one, are facing. This is a unique opportunity to be a part of something much bigger than ourselves as we seek for justice to be brought in an unjust world.

,Trying to raise money for PTSD service dog,"https://www.gofundme.com/rg6br8-raising-money-for-ptsd-service-dog

Hello there. First and foremost, I want to thank you for taking the time to read my (very long) story, for sharing, for words of encouragement, and for any donations that may come from this fundraiser. Please try to make it all the way through this description, it's long but it's long because I want to be as open, honest, and raw as I can possibly be with you. I also want to warn anybody who may suffer from similar mental health issues that I will be describing the violence that happened to me in some detail so that you the readers can understand the full scope of why I am asking for your help. It's a hard story to read and to tell but I want you to know ahead of time that I am a survivor and a fighter and I have discovered through this incident that I can do anything I put my mind to. 

In 2012, I was your average college student. I was 22 years old, had come from a small town, and college was an eye opening beautiful experience for me. It was a place of learning and passion and diversity and I quickly had a tight knit, close group of friends that I believed would do anything to support each other. I spent every single day with a few of them that I bonded with. And for three years, I was blissfully happy, surrounded by laughter and love and trust. I look back now and wonder, as any victim of violence does, if there was anything I missed. Some sign that one of my closest friends was a ticking time bomb. I can't honestly say there was any indication. 

That summer, almost exactly 7 years to the day of me writing this, that friend and I decided to make a quick overnight camping trip. He and I had spent plenty of nights alone, had partied together, had done every thing platonic friends do, so I was in no way worried about going camping alone with him, but at the last second a girlfriend decided to go with us. I'm grateful she did because she ended up saving my life that night. So we get to our campsite and set up the tent, get the fire going, start pouring the drinks, go fishing and generally have a great time. I should mention that the campsite we were at is only  30 minutes from town but there is zero cell service. There are several different camp sites in the area, as well as a camp manager during the summer who lives in a little house by the parking lot. So my friend had just turned 21 and couldn't handle his alcohol very well and he gets drunk QUICKLY. I've been drunk around him plenty of times but this time was different. He started separating my friend and I to talk to us privately and he was saying the weirdest things. To give you an idea of his mental state, he was saying things like he was an agent with the FBI who had a ton of money in his account and he could easily make us disappear and get away with it. As the night wore on my girlfriend noticed that her axe was missing. There were just a lot of little weird things that were happening to make us uneasy and we'd never seen him act this way when he was drunk before. Eventually he passed out by the fire and we kind of joked about how weird he was acting but I was relieved that he'd finally fallen asleep and I think my friend was too. We started getting ready to go to bed, cleaned up the site and banked the fire. A storm that had been on the horizon had finally blown our direction and we could feel raindrops. We went over to where he had fallen asleep and started shaking him to wake him up and get him in the tent and it was like a bomb went off. All of a sudden he was completely sober and completely out of his mind. He started screaming this loud, gutteral, non-stop scream that still haunts me in my nightmares. He threw my friend across the campsite by her shirt and she tripped over a log, dropping the flashlight, and the entire area went pitch black. Then he launched himself at me. I fell onto my back, knocking the wind out of me, with him on top of me. I remember vaguely hearing my friend screaming and calling my name but I could barely hear her. He had both hands wrapped around my neck and was squeezing so hard I could feel my face swelling and getting red. I should mention that he is a tall guy. I don't remember exact measurements but I think he was about 6'5'', but lanky and muscular. He also has incredibly long arms. I was completely outmatched. I know that I was panicking, I was trying to buck him off of me with my hips, I was scratching up his arms and hands, I ripped his shirt, but nothing I was doing made any difference. I know my friend was trying to pull him off me but she wasn't having any luck either. One of the last things I remember before I blacked out was that I realized where I had fallen was close to my purse, which had a sharp hunting knife in it, so I stretched my arms out and started feeling all around me trying to feel for it. It was no use though, and after what felt like an eternity but in all reality was probably 90 seconds of struggling with him, I lost consciousness. The next thing I remember was my girlfriend pulling, dragging, and carrying me away from the campsite. She was crying and at first I was confused and in shock and still trying to breathe but when I fully came to, about 20 feet from the campsite I went into full meltdown hysterics. She told me I needed to be quiet because she had kneed him in the face and stunned him enough to make him let go, but he could easily come to and follow us. She said she had totally lost it when I lost consciousness and that I'd been out for 10 minutes before I came to enough to respond. I had already taken my shoes off to get into the tent and I remember feeling every rock and root tear into my skin as we walked half a mile, sobbing and shaking, to the camp manager's house. The really nice couple that lived there sat me on the couch and called the police and ambulance. When the police showed up, they asked us if we knew if he had a weapon. We explained about the missing axe and they started down the trail towards our campsite and the first responders started working to load me into the ambulance and hook me up to the machines. As we were getting ready to leave for the hospital, the police came back down the trail with him. They said when they got there he was completely naked, swinging the axe, and screaming about how the devil made him do it. 

So that's it. I mean, obviously there's a LOT more to the story, but that is my experience of almost being killed by a person that I truly thought was going to be one of my best friends for life. I had planned for him to be in my wedding, be uncle to my future kids. I'm leaving out the hospital details, my injuries, and how the next few weeks went for me. I will say that I DID press charges, and he pled guilty, but because we were not in a relationship and it was not domestic violence, and because I was too scared and traumatized to take the stand and tell my story, he was basically let off with a slap on the hand. If there is one thing that I will regret for the rest of my life, it is not being strong enough to face him in court so he could be punished in the way he really deserved. Because he is dangerous and I have no doubt that this will happen to somebody else, but maybe that person will not have a friend there to save their life. But here is the most painful part of the entire experience, the reason I fight so hard for victims rights, the reason I will forever understand why women don't come forward when they are the victim of rape or abuse: half of those beautiful friends that I loved and trusted and spent every day with completely abandoned me. They took ""his side"". I'm not even sure what ""his side"" is since he pled guilty. They KNEW he did it, but they were furious that I went through with pressing charges, thought I was doing it for the attention, and that I was ruining his life for ""a stupid drunken decision"". It hurt then and it still breaks my heart to think about it now. I don't know how anybody can take the side of a person that admitted to almost killing his friend in a bizarre drunken rage. But, to look on the bright side, I found out who my TRUE best friends were, and I still talk to them every day. One of those people that stood by me was one of that man's best friends, he was the first person I called when I was released from the hospital, he held my hand while I listened to the judge sentence him in court, and he's officiating my wedding in October. I love him to pieces and he stood beside me, day and night, for months while I shook through long, mind numbing panic attacks, self harm, and suicidal ideation.

Now that you know what happened to me, let me explain what I have experienced since this happened to me. First and foremost, anxiety. Anxiety about every single thing. I have anxiety about so many things, it would be easier to list the things I don't have anxiety about. Just thinking about anxiety has made my heart start racing and my chest get tight, which leads directly into my second thing: panic attacks. The kind of panic attacks that make you think your head is splitting open and you're dying. To give you a small example, I work in a restaurant and the head chef came up behind me so quietly I didn't notice he was there until he shouted something to somebody up front and I jumped and turned around and he was holding a knife in his hand. I don't blame him, he didn't know I have PTSD, but I immediately turned into a limp sobbing puddle on the floor. It took me 2 hours sitting in my car, crying my heart out, before I was safe enough to drive home. Flashbacks and nightmares: I hear his voice in my head, telling me he could make me disappear, rough and gravelly. I feel his shirt tearing like tissue paper in my hands, something will trigger my memory and I'm on the ground, in the dark, and I can't breathe. I can smell the vodka on his breath and I can hear that blood curdling scream. My fiancé has gotten used to me shaking him awake in the middle of the night, crying hysterically after a nightmare. He always has to hold me and comfort me until I fall back asleep. This is our normal. I LOVE camping. I did it most of my childhood and sitting around a campfire laughing and feeling the peace of the forest is, in my opinion, the epitome of joy. But I've only been camping 3 times in the passed 7 years. It breaks my heart that he stole that from me. One thing I've had to work very hard to accept about myself was that last moment before I lost consciousness. Reaching out, looking for my purse to grab my knife. There is nothing more terrifying to realize about yourself than to know you would maim or kill one of your best friends to save your own life. I know he would have killed me if we'd been alone, but I am grateful I never found my purse. I'm grateful I survived the attack but I am glad the thing I am dealing with is a ""what if"" situation and not the knowledge that I took the life of a living breathing person to save myself. The next and last thing I'm going to talk about (but definitely not the last symptom I'm experiencing) is that I very very rarely leave my house, and when I do it's never alone. I have become a shut in, a total recluse. My anxiety and fear paralyze me when I think about going out. I can't go grocery shopping without my fiancé. I can't go shopping at the mall. The sweet girl at the clothing store that asks if I need help sends me into a sweating, shaking mess. The person that bumps into me and politely says excuse me makes me want to run away. When my fiancé and I DO go out, I can't relax. I'm constantly looking around, watching people, locating emergency exits and getting ready to run. It's exhausting. It's no way to live. I've been saying for years that I would never take my own life, but if I just didn't wake up one day it would be a relief. And that breaks my family's heart. It breaks my fiance's heart. My family and friends love me, they support me, but they can never understand the baggage and fear that rules my life. They can't understand that when I cancel plans last minute, it's because my fear literally will not let me get out of bed. It used to be that every year on the anniversary of my attack I would sit in bed in the dark and shake and cry. Two years ago I got fed up with that and decided to redirect that energy. For the entire week before the day, I do a fundraiser for a local women's shelter. My experience may not have been domestic violence based but so many women suffer from similar violence and I figure if the money I raise saves even one woman from what I experienced, it will be worth it. I have raised a couple thousand dollars since I started. And for that one week, I can almost forget, until it ends and everything crashes down around me again. My friends and family were very happy to hear that after 7 long years of living like this, I made my first therapy session. I haven't seen a therapist since a few weeks after the incident, and that therapist did not make me feel great about myself. I'm nervous but hoping this time will be different. It's scheduled for the end of June. But I am hoping for something more.

Which leads me to the end of this VERY long message, and if you've made it this far, I am SO grateful you stuck with me. I am hoping to raise money to purchase a dog that will be trained to be my PTSD service dog. There is a local trainer in my city that specializes in PTSD that I've been in contact with. PTSD service dogs are psychiatric therapy dogs that are trained to do a variety of things to help victims. They can retrieve medication, they can wake up their owner if that person is having a night terror, they can search homes to alleviate anxiety of intruders (I sleep with a knife next to my bed), they can deflect sensory overload, and they can ground their owner during flashbacks and panic attacks. In other words, this dog could change my entire life. It could give me a reason to live again. I fully believe that between therapy and a service dog, my life can return to some semblance of normal. Which is where all of you reading this come in. It's expensive. The dog I am looking at will cost $1500. It's a lot to ask for. And I don't even expect to raise the full amount. ANY amount raised will take a tremendous load off our finances. And I do not want ANYBODY to donate if donating would put you in your own financial difficulty. I am going to stop this long, rambling story and say thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading. Even if you cannot donate, it would be greatly appreciated if you could share my story. Maybe my story will help another woman feel brave enough to tell her own story."

,My nephew was murdered. We’re raising money for a reward for anyone who comes forward with information that leads to arrest in his case,"My 21 year-old nephew was shot and killed by a stray bullet on the morning of Sunday, May 21, 2019. 
We don’t know who killed him. 
He was hanging out with his car club friends at a gas station down the street from a club. 

Apparently there was a fight at the club and someone started shooting. They killed someone who was completely innocent. That person is still free 

My nephew didn’t have a bad bone in his body. He never fought with anyone. Never had an argument. He was a peaceful person who loved fast cars, animals, Taco Bell, and spongebob. He was set to start truck driving school the week that he was killed. His life was just beginning and it was taken away by a coward who won’t even come forward. 

We’re raising money to offer a reward to anyone who comes forward with valid information that leads to an arrest. It’s been almost a month and nothing. 

I have started both a GoFundMe and a Facebook fundraiser. 
If you can’t donate, please share.

,Bunny spay,"My rabbit Bessie is absolutely adorable. I adopted her in April of this year and she's been nothing but the best emotional support I've ever had. However I'm worried about her health: the older she gets, the more likely it is for her to get cancer of her reproductive organs. Does have 70-80% chance of developing a untreatable diseases on ovaries and uterus after turning 4. Bessie is 2, maybe a little older (not exactly sure because she's an adoptive bunny) and probably hard of hearing. She's had a bout of GI stasis in late April, and ever since I've been very worried.

,A little girl needs the most expensive medicine in the world to survive. Let's help.,"The Tartu University Hospital Children Foundation is collecting donations to finance gene treatment of a three-month Annabel, whom was diagnosed spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)*. The Foundation has already contributed with 400,000€.

SMA is a rare disease, occuring once per 11 thousand births. The disease leads to the fact that a child does not develop muscles and dies within 2 years. The treatment is available but very expensive. Some weeks ago a gene medicine called zolgensma received an official approval in the United States (US). Numerous researchers have confirmed that children suffering from SMA can fully recover. In the US zolgensma costs 2,125 million USD for one patient, being one of the most expensive medicine in the world.

To maintain the donations of the treatment that will save Annabel’s life, You can donate through the bank accounts of the SA Tartu University Hospital Children Foundation (SA Tartu Ülikooli Kliinikumi Lastefond) indicating in the explanation „Annabel“:

,Lifetime water filters for jungle villages,"My wife and I run a small nonprofit that works with hill tribes in the jungles of Northern Thailand providing free water filters. 

We are part of GlobalGiving and right now they are matching any donations we might get. For the last seven years we have been entirely self-funded and we don't mind that. Unfortunately we personally can't afford to do it by ourselves any more.

A simple, one time $10 donation would really help us to buy more materials so we can build more filters and provide more Water and Sanitation Hygiene (WaSH) training. Please consider giving the gift of safe water to kids in villages.

You can see what we're all about on our site http://thecrproject.org. We have been working with hill tribes for almost ten years now, entirely self funded. We have helped people with medical needs by transporting from the jungle to the city and paying all hospital bills, that's actually how we got started. From there we started teaching English using iPads, village elders wanted the kids to know English.

While doing that we were approached by people who were getting sick and having kidney issues. We took water samples to be tested and were told the water had to be boiled for 10 minutes in order to be safe, now we build and provide biosand water filters that will last each household a lifetime.

Thank you very much.

TL;DR We are asking people to donate $10 to help provide water filters to remote villages in the jungles of Northern Thailand."
,Need help to save our house,"My mom 3 months ago had a total thyroidectomy surgery, she had a huge lump growing in her neck and the doctors had to take it  out, before her surgery she was crying and having anxiety that 1. She would not wake up from the surgery table or 2. That she didn't know how long it would take for her to recover so she can go back to work. Since my mom hasn't been able to work, we are now 2 months behind on our rent, we have a disconnection notice from our electricity and water bill and we haven't been ble to afford her medication. I work as an online English tutor and my salary is about 2,000 pesos ($38) a month because I only started a month ago and I try to balance that with my studies so I am only ale to work 4 hours in a day. My mother is the strongest and most loving and kindest person we could have ever been blessed with. It's been 3 months since she last worked and her surgery has affected her voice, my mom hasn't been able to speak properly for months now because she is taking longer to recover because the doctors said that her case was rare. The muscle in her neck, instead of being able to heal fully after 4 weeks, started to bruise, which caused her to lose about 60% of her voice and she has a hard time breathing when she talks. I don't know what else to do because I don't have anyone to reach out to and my mom is doing her best to get us by even though she should be resting, se has borrowed money from our relatives and we are in debt with them so they won't let us borrow anymore, the salary I get is only enough to buy diapers and a boc of milk for my little brother and some groceries for a week. I don't know how we are going to get by this week so I'm reaching out to as many people as I can in the hopes that one of them will help out our family. I hope you can find it in your heart to help a family like ours.

My name is Eric, and I am a math teacher from Puerto Rico, now in Houston. When I lived on the island, I started getting sick a lot. Recently, a doctor discovered a large polyp in my sinuses that had been growing for years. I recently had a surgery to correct my septum, but the doctor missed the polyp and perforated my septum.  I need to remove it ASAP, as it has gotten harder to breathe at night and I cannot sleep much anymore. It has caused fluid to collect in my lungs (which have caused constant coughing and bronchial spasms), recurring URI's, a sensation similar to brain zaps, and possibly my anxiety issues.  I was planning on combining my tax return with a summer job (or two) to pay for the surgery to finally remove it, but recent changes in tax law has overwhelmingly reduced my return.

Unfortunately, we both recently lost our jobs, and we are struggling to pay for COBRA insurance and the copays for our chemotherapy. (While we are looking into cheaper plans like Medicaid, it is taking time for us to qualify and looks like it might not cover the specialty RA medications we take.)

,Need Help - Cancer fighter low on funds for future treatments,"Hi everyone

A friend of mine has started a campaign to raise funds for a cancer patient in Bangalore, India. Prema is currently undergoing second round of chemotherapy procedure to treat a high risk [Choriocarcinoma](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001496.htm). She has replenished her personal savings and has no funds remaining to cover future costs. Prema comes from a poor family of Indian farmers.

,Expecting parents of child with heart defects need assistance,"Two friends of mine are expecting a child that was recently diagnosed with HRHS (hypoplastic right heart syndrome) and AVSD (atrioventricular septal defect). Their child will need a few surgeries to survive, and immediate Care after birth. She has one side of her heart smaller than the other side, and only one chamber, whereas normally there would be four. Due to this, they need to go to Cincinnati for a specialist, as there are no hospitals in WV that are equipped for something this severe. This means they would need to take time off work for a few months, as the mother would need another adult with her for medical reasons, and the father wants to be there for his wife and child. This means they would have no income during this time as neither is able to have any income whatsoever, as Cincinnati is hours away from where they live. Delivery would have to happen there, otherwise their child is very likely to die.


Please help donate and share so they can get some assistance with an already stressful situation. It's the father's first child and it's a rough hand to be dealt. They're wishing to raise enough to cover their bills during this.

,"GoFundMe for a man that lost his dog, RV, and livelihood while moving due to an oncoming wrong way driver","My mother is not a redditor, but is wanting to get information out about a GoFundMe account set up for this man that lost his RV and dog while moving from California to Texas to an oncoming wrong way driver on the highway. 

Here is her message about the event:

My husband and I came upon a fiery car accident on June 1st, 2019 on I-40 in Northern Arizona. An elderly man was trapped in his RV and flames were encroaching from the other vehicle that had hit him head on. Several men assisted in rescuing the man who was later identified as Johnny Howard Ross. He suffered multiple injuries including a broken leg, a broken pelvis, a concussion and after he got to the hospital he suffered a massive stroke. He lost is dog in the RV fire and his life savings that he was taking with him to his destination. His wife's ashes were in the RV too and assumed burned up but miraculously they were recovered days later at the LANDFILL where they dumped the shell of the burned up RV.  Apparently he was having problems with his home safe and so he had $6,000 in cash with him that burned up in the fire. He is in critical condition in Flagstaff, Arizona. He and his family are all from Bakersfield, California. His family is staying in the Taylor House next door indefinitely. It cost $60 a day. Johnny goes by the name Howard. Howard will need to be transported back to California after he is well enough and he will need to be in a long-term care facility for some time before he can move in with his son Charles. There have been 3 news stories about him and one radio interview this week to help get out the word about the GoFundMe. His life will never be the same. any donations to help him out would be appreciated. [A GoFundMe account has been set up for him.](https://www.gofundme.com/pkwebw-hit-head-on-and-trapped-in-rv)

,"Help a young mum-of-two to fight MS so she can be there for her kids, 6 and 3 years old","(tl;dr at end of this post)

Bronwyn is a young mum of two who suffers from multiple sclerosis. Recently she has relapsed, and she is at risk of losing her sight or mobility permanently. There are few things more terrifying than the fear of not watching your children grow or what would happen if you could not care for them.

Bronwyn wants to be there for her children for as long as she can, so she is trying to get to Mexico for HSCT treatment to halt progression of her MS.

The HSCT (haematopoietic stem cell transplantation) is a month-long intense chemotherapy treatment in Mexico, which requires around three months home quarantine on her return to New Zealand, while her immune system begins to re-build.

The results from this treatment have been really great but it is not yet available in NZ for MS. Bronwyn's admission date in Mexico is 14 October 2019 but the cost of treatment, carer, and flights is over NZ$100,000.

Her daughter Sienna asks why she is always tired, sick and needing medicine. Sienna made Bron a star chart for doing things like reading stories and making dinner. These should be easily achievable for a mother and yet on days when even a wisp of air causes pain and Bron can't hold a book; or when fatigue is so extreme cooking is a fire risk and even cereal for dinner is a challenge, completing these tasks is an accomplishment.

Bron's children are still young; they still want her to play. This is something she already struggles with and will only get harder without this treatment.

Bronwyn would appreciate any and all help to get to Mexico for treatment. Her family and friends are rallying round and doing all they can to raise funds; I u/rrrona am a longtime friend of this amazing woman.

Here is a link to her Give-A-Little fundraiser:

Among those rewards are the option to donate to a selection of charities, or to exchange those points for a KarmaKarma gift card.

,Help With Gender-Affirming Surgery,"Hi!   I'm Alice.  And I'm a transgender woman.  I've been medically  transitioning for a little over a year, now.  And, as part of my  transition, I'm hoping to undergo facial feminization surgery (FFS).  To  realize this next step in my transition, I've started a [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/help-alice-battle-dysphoria-with-ffs) campaign and am humbly asking for your support.

&#x200B;

FFS  is a suite of surgical procedures, which vary from person to person,  designed to make the face look more ""feminine"" by changing some of the  facial features more commonly associated with testosterone-based  puberty.

&#x200B;

**So why is this important?**

&#x200B;

For  me, my face is a great source of gender dysphoria.  Because of this, I  have difficulty feeling happy or comfortable in my own body.  By  undergoing FFS, my outward appearance will be more in line with that of  my internal self-image.  My body will more closely match that of my  personal gender identity and gender expression and this will go a long  way toward promoting my own self-worth and mental well-being.

&#x200B;

This  isn't simply a cosmetic surgery.  My goal with this procedure is not to  look ""pretty.""  Rather, it's to alleviate issues which make me deeply  uncomfortable in my own skin.

&#x200B;

**Why GoFundMe?**

&#x200B;

The  approximate cost of the procedure, as quoted to me,  (including surgery  and all medical costs) is $27,000 USD.  That's a lot of money.  In  fact, it's more money than I've ever seen in my life.

&#x200B;

Living  in a low-income household, I have KY Medicaid.  Which will not cover  gender-affirming surgeries.  And will not cover any medical costs  outside of KY.  Because the two surgeons which I am considering booking  with are both outside of KY, and because of the aforementioned lack of  coverage even if they weren't, my only option for funding outside of  crowdfunding is loans.  And, while that may end up being the route I  have to take, I'm already in debt from student loans and would like to  avoid any further debt as much as possible.

&#x200B;

**Please give if you can.**

&#x200B;

If  you can't, that's fine.  But if you could spare just a dollar or, at  least, share my GoFundMe with your friends, it would genuinely mean the  world to me.

&#x200B;

This  procedure is so very, very important to me.  And it's very hard for me  to be open about this, let alone ask for monetary assistance.

&#x200B;

So,  I guess all that's left to say is thank you so much for reading.  Thank  you for your time.  And thank you so much for your love and support.   It means a great deal to me.  <3

,"Help keep my mom, stepdad and I off the streets","https://paypal.me/pools/c/8fdQpKdFS6

My mother, stepfather and I lost our home in February as we could not afford the rent of $1600 after the landlord increased it. My mother has been sickly and out of work, with kidney and back problems, while myself and my stepfather were the only 2 bringing in money.

We've been in a motel for 3 months and have finally reached the point where we can't afford it anymore. The motel charges $88/night and $108/night on weekends. That on top of food and paying our storage unit has left us in this position.

If you can help in any way to get us a few days more in the motel while we try to get longer-term help, it would be greatly appreciated. Even if you can't, sharing is extremely helpful as well.

Thank you."

She hasn't felt like herself for a long time, and not being able to do as much as she used to has got her down to the point where it was beginning to seriously affect her mental health.

Since starting this fundraiser, she has felt much better and more positive in tackling her diagnosis because she feels like she is actually doing something and is giving back to those who help her!

,"Help me provide Syrian refugees w/ urgently needed food, healthcare, and education!","https://my.rationchallengeusa.org/isabellacooper

Hi everyone,

I have decided to take on a week-long ration challenge to try and spread awareness about the Syrian refugee crisis. This challenge is designed so that someone taking the challenge, that being me, eats very little amounts of food daily, while spreading awareness and raising money for the cause (sponsoring me). 

I am hoping to raise $450 towards helping refugees. $40 alone will pay for 4 medical visits for 4 refugees, $50 will pay for 3 months of food, $90 will provide 5 refugees with school kits (bags, pencils, notebooks), & $195 will pay for a refugee's food for a full year. All funds goes towards CWS who then provides for the refugees. None of the money goes to me. 

The money raised will ""...provide Syrian refugees with food, medicine and education. And most importantly, you'll be helping them find the physical and emotional strength they need to cope with the horrors they've suffered, and the hardships of life as a refugee."""
,Looking for a UK charity where I can spend time with lonely people,"Hey. I would like to use some of my free time well this summer. I believe I have good people skills and enjoy listening to others' experiences. I would love to just keep people company and hate that so many people feel isolated in these modern times. I would be free perhaps only for one or two days a week. I do give to certain charities and have done similar things online but I would much rather help directly and really think I could make a difference this way.

I don't mind what age group I'm helping and have a 'clean' background, DBS checks etc. not a problem. I think my ideal group would be 20-35 year old males dealing with psychological issues but am no expert so am open to anything. Does anyone in the UK (I'm in Ashford, Kent) do something similar or have any ideas? I am able to drive.

Thank you,

Tim"
,Daycamp for children with cancer. They go free of charge. https://www.sunrise-walks.org/…/MyPage/3128995/Brian-Darwell," 

There are roughly 550 children in the greater New York area who are diagnosed with cancer every year. These children, and their families, have a challenge most of us will never know, but there is a magical way to change the lives of these special children in our community. Sunrise Day Camp is the only summer day camp of its kind in the world that allows children with cancer and their siblings to forget about the daily stress and pain of cancer treatments and enjoy fun-filled days at camp, free of charge! To accomplish this, the camp relies heavily on donations from the community.

I’m so proud to say that my team, the Gettry Marcus Sunrisers, will be walking in support of Sunrise Day Camp, on Sunday, June 2nd at SunriseWALKS 2019, at the Henry Kaufmann Campgrounds in Wheatley Heights. As a team, we are committed to raising $150,000. Words cannot describe how much this charity means to my firm and me. It is such a rewarding feeling to see the smiles on these kids' faces, and know that we are able to contribute to their happiness. The video below really captures just how much our help and support means to these kids and their families.

It would be greatly appreciated if you can join me in raising funds for this event. I am asking for your help by contributing to my personal fundraising page at: [https://www.sunrise-walks.org/…/MyPage/3128995/Brian-Darwell](https://www.sunrise-walks.org/LongIsland/Member/MyPage/3128995/Brian-Darwell?fbclid=IwAR3IhCO88UFOEFiHrZxgS8FNKRlgVGrTdiAEc8z3yH7tbKU4oCs6Y_PI0R0).

,Need Help Funding a Classroom Library in a Title I School (X-Post in r/GoFundMe)," 

Since 2017, I have been teaching 11th grade English at Del Valle High School in Del Valle, Texas--one of the most SPIRITED schools I've ever seen.

Asking a teacher ""what makes your students special?"" is like asking a mother ""why do you love your kid so much?"" In some ways, you just can't explain it--there's really something magical about the bond between a teacher and her students that words can't quite reach.

All I can say is that my students truly are special--you'll just have to take my word for it.

My students make me laugh on a daily basis, get me to question my understanding of the world, force me to constantly reflect on and improve my practice, ask me huge (unanswerable) questions, and fill my life with meaning.

They are curious, funny, insightful, deep thinkers. And they deserve a magnificent classroom library.

DVHS is a Title I school where 83% of students are classified as ""economically disadvantaged."" 71% of the student body receives free lunch. Every day, my students struggle with very real, adult problems, while still striving to earn their high school degrees. They work two jobs after school, they raise children, and they struggle to help support their families. For some of my students, making it to school every day is a real act of defiance--defying the odds, defying expectations.

As an English teacher, my goal is to make lifelong readers out of every student I meet. Unfortunately, many of my students did not grow up in print-rich environments and admit to me that they have never finished an entire book in their lives.

I am trying to provide the resources to put a book in the hands over every student--and not just any book, but a book that they love.

All it takes is one really phenomenal experience with a book to realize that this ""reading"" thing isn't so bad!

It is important to me that my students are able to read books that represent their unique experiences and understand that their stories and cultures matter.

At this point, I've spent quite a bit of money on building up a classroom library, but I'm afraid my budget has been pushed to the limit! Any help I can get in funding my classroom library would be a huge help!

This GoFundMe will work toward purchasing bulk orders of the following books, which will be used to create book clubs for next year's students:

1. Everyday by David Levithan
2. The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas
3. It Calls You Back by Luis Rodriguez Jr.
4. Heat by Mike Lupicia
5. My Bloody Life by Reymundo Sanchez
6. Exit, Pursued by a Bear by E.K. Johnston
7. I'll Give You the Sun by Jandy Nelson
8. Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell
9. Everything Everything by Nicola Yoon
10. Stronger, Faster, and More Beautiful by Arwen Elys Dayton
11. Outcasts United by John St. Warren
12. Blue Rage, Black Redemption by Stanley Tookie WIlliams
13. The Book Thief by Markus Zusak
14. Boy 21 by Matthew Quick

These books were chosen by current students, who were asked to select texts that they believe next year's juniors will love. I tried to provide a selection that included romance, sci-fi, non-fiction, urban fiction, and sports.

If you would like proof that I work at the school, please DM me and I can send you my employee email address, or a photo of my yearbook picture!

,ISO some help,"Hello, I am in search of some financial help. I know this sounds cliche, but I am struggling and have been out of work for a few months. I have been submitting applications to get a day to day job so I don't have to worry about seeking money from other sources, but it has been a struggle.

In the last year, my wife, two kids, and I were evicted out of our apartment in a small town, due to unpaid rent (which was withheld for legitimate purposes). No matter what evidence we had for the case, our landlord still won the judgement and we had to leave. So in a desperate attempt to make sure my family had a roof, I contacted a family member who offered us room and board. So we packed everything we could into our car, a truck, and a minivan, moving in immediately. After unloading everything into a sketchy looking three story house, my family member (neglected to tell us) that it was infested with bedbugs, roaches, and fleas, and needed a deep cleaning before anyone could live in it properly. Over the course of a few days, my wife and I invested the time and money from our recent marriage gifts to help with the cleaning to ensure we could have a roof over our heads. Well in the end we were let down, we lost everything except for the items we had stored off site at my wifes mothers apartment. We tried to make things work out of a two bedroom apartment in the city, 3 adults, 1 teenager, a 5 year old, and our daughter who was born in august of 2018.

In the middle of summer, when temperatures finally hit 110 degrees outside, my wife finally said we needed to get out, and put our family first. We made another desperate attempt to find a better home for our family, and its working out. My father had asked us to move in with him, as he was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer. So we took the offer and here we are.

&#x200B;

My wife will be starting a new job in a few weeks, but we have expenses we need help with, to keep our family happy and healthy. I am not asking for much, but just some help.

,I need help: my college education is at stake,"I am an out of state student at a small liberal arts college and have been studying to teach 7-12 education for three years. Due to my out of state status, I am unable to receive any help regarding transportation to and from classroom internships. I was lucky enough to get by on carpool for three years without any problems, but now o have no options for that. 

I have recently ""made the choice"" to give up on my career to save my family some money. I had tried to, with the help of my in laws, lease a car to save my dream. I needed it for the final three classes in the program. These classes are smaller and my carpool options for them were all zilch.  Two of them are pre-student teaching and one is actual student teaching. All have required daily drives to the schools, which are anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours away one way commute. These drives range from a four week daily basis to an entire semester, also daily. 

The reason the lease I mentioned earlier was a failure was because of my mother. I posted this on r/raisedbynarcissists and was told to try and work things out here. Long story short, her end of this deal was the car insurance until I graduate and being the name on the lease. She refused to take my in laws money for the monthly lease payment because she wanted their names on the lease. Due to the differences in our state residency, it is impossible and impractical. Also, my insurance would hike up to $500 a month due to them being in a no fault state, while I legally live in a ""standard"" state. My original rate was $75-$80 a month, which was all I needed to make this happen. 

Without this money, I can't finish my college education unless I take an extra year and change the ""concentration"" to my major. I already have plans for the future if no one wants to give, but I thought why not try here? 

I have so much to give as an educator and I'm so close to being able to do it, I just need an extra push to do it."

Maintaining work is extremely difficult due to the pain I experience but it has to be done because who else is going to pay the bills! I have recently been to see a private spinal dr as the NHS has proven to be no joy! Iv had a number of scans and examinations, the spinal dr has discovered that my spine is very badly twisted along with my pelvis and she believes this is whats causing my pain! I have so far had 2 treatments consisting of bone adjustment, however she feels that I will require alot of visits 72 to be precise due to the severity of this. This will cost me £2374!! My question is does anybody know of any grants available in the UK to pay for stuff like this? Truth is, im desperate to receive this treatment however its simply out of my price range!

The doctor said my case was rare and its a immediate medical care. I don't have health insurance and here in the philippines we don't have foundation that will help you with your medical test bill. We also talked to our government to ask for help but they said they can't help me due to the limited funds. I really got no choice but to create this fundraising to have a money for my medical tests.

Please help me and my family. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

'Hey friends! I am blocking the person I am making this post about from seeing it. I have a friend who is just the sweetest person. Shes had a rough life. She lost her fiance and two children. Shes really trying to be strong but shes suffering. She had to face the hardest thing any mother could and pull the life support on her baby. We met just before this happened and I am too far to hug her... Too far to hold her. She was the first person to support my business among the midst of this time. She blows my mind. Now shes out of remission with cancer and shes back in chemo. Shes losing her hair. Shes dealing with pain and illness. Today she had a tough day where someone made her feel really bad about her appearance and the way she smells while going through chemo. Its ripping her apart. She has no real solid support system and no supportive partner. She is in a state of extreme anxiety panic and depression. I noticed in her posts shes putting herself down for not having things she needs not even having the right things to cover her hair loss not in a way where shes seeking pity or help but shes genuinely putting herself down because her self worth has plummeted My heart aches. I remember going through sickness and losing my jobs not having any support the day of my tumor removal, medicines making me sweat through my clothes, peeing myself having no clue about how to buy the right wig or wear it, the mood swings, and the lack of the will to live... I want so bad to be there for her. I remember two strangers named. A.S. and L.W. being the only twobpeople there for me. Thats how i met them total strangers who had hearts of gold and chose to be there for support. I was thinking that I would like to ask for a gift for christmas. Ill post my paypal link in the comments of this post and If you would like to donate towards this and include a message for her with your donation I would like to buy her a wig and the nessicary supplies to make this more comfortable for her and to show her she is loved and valued and that her life is precious and she deserves nice things and she deserves to smile. Ill find an artistic way to include the messages so whenever she feels consumed by loneliness she can turn to them. Thank you for reading and considering helping out! Every single penny will help ! And yes you can share this story with your friends and family and the link to my paypal and my email but the post will only be viewable by my friends because I had to block her from seeing it in the settings'"

Iv had a number of scans and examinations, the spinal dr has discovered that my spine is very badly twisted along with my pelvis and she believes this is whats causing my pain! I have so far had 2 treatments consisting of bone adjustment, however she feels that I will require alot of visits 72 to be precise due to the severity of this. This will cost me £2374!! My question is does anybody know of any grants available in the UK to pay for stuff like this? Truth is, im desperate to receive this treatment however its simply out of my price range!

,Donate to puppers of a deployed military officer in need,"I run a small dog boarding business on the side. I occasionally get people in an emergency situation that need same day bookings for their dogs. 
Today, a wife of a friend/co-worker contacted me because she knew I do boarding, and said she had a friend in a dire situation. Her friend is currently deployed overseas with the Air Force, and just found out her husband, back here at home, has become a drug addict. She needed to have someone care for their dogs for the time being. 

Her friend brought the dogs over, I was expecting two, but out popped this third dog. They are all clearly malnourished, and one looks like a complete skeleton. It seems like he hasn’t been fed in a long time. He also has lacerations, dried blood, and scabs on his face and neck. 

All three appear dehydrated, and nails are so long that two of them seem to be struggling to walk. Her husband clearly wasn’t caring for the dogs at all. 

I currently have enough food for them on my own, however the husband didn’t have any of the necessary items to care for dogs. 

I am hoping that any generous dog lovers out there would like to donate any funds I can use to purchase some extra blankets, dog beds, toys, and bowls for these puppers, as their mom comes back from deployment in 20 days and will be starting over with them. Any little bit helps! 

My cashapp is $JustLikeHomeBoarding, or if any one would like to donate any items instead, I can work with you in that over PM.

,Please help my friend.,"Hello friends! 

My name is Diana Tonkova from Dupnica.

My fight for life began in August 2017. Until then I was an energetic, working mother, full of life. But life can take sudden turns.At first, I noticed a problem with my left leg, and soon after – my whole way of walking was compromised. I took the necessary measures immediately and after multiple hospital visits, tests and MIRs,…on January 2018, I was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).ALS is a neurological disease that leads to muscle atrophy, followed by paralysis and death. I’ve been in a wheelchair for a year. Unfortunately, the atrophy continues to progress and has started to impact my arms and breathing.To this day, there is no known cure for ALS, but the doctors recommend an experimental stem sell treatment in Turkey.Even though there is no guarantee that I will be cured entirely, the treatment promiss that the progression of the disease will stop. At a minimum, several rounds of treatment are recommended. They need to happen once a month, without interrupting the cycle. So far, with the help of friends and family, we were able to raise the sum needed to cover the cost of the first two transfusions, the last one being in July. At least two more are needed, but the cost is beyond our means.

This is my only chance of being the productive mother and wife I was before. So I ask you to please open your heart for me. I believe there are good people out there, who won’t stay indifferent to the tragedy of a fading life. Because there is hope.Every time you share this message – it’s another chance for me to live.Every donation brings hope!

A job that is finally able to help me catch up and pay my bills after almost 11 years of being an adult. I have been in food service for most of my adult life. I didn't really need to be on medication as my mind could wander while my body was on autopilot. Now I work an office job that pays more and doesn't hurt my wrists nearly as badly as my old jobs did. What makes me think that I am going to loose my job is that the same amount of work that takes my co-worker who hired in two weeks after me takes half a day to finish takes me all day with a little left over for the next day with errors. I won't have medical for another two months and I don't think that I will last that long with my mind wandering causing me to attach files to the wrong accounts on legal documents.

,it’s time to ask for help...,"buckle in, folks, this one is a little bit of a long read. :/

my name is alex and i’m a 26 year old girl residing in the southwest united states. first, i’ll provide some context- i had successful surgery on my right kidney (the good kidney between the two) in late august and thought it would get me by long enough to get back on my feet after 5 weeks of unpaid medical leave from my job. fast forward to now, just a few months later, and i am undergoing treatment for my left kidney already. between the pain, constant appointments, and the heavy likelihood I will have to undergo another surgery or two, i have been forced back on to unpaid medical leave, again... for an indefinite amount of time until i can be well and functional again. I have never felt so defeated, useless, and down right broken... 

Because of this, i am swallowing my pride and finally asking for help. my partner works full time and is usually able to take care of our rent payments and all of our most important bills (utilities, internet, car insurance), and we have cancelled all unneeded subscriptions like netflix, hulu, spotify, etc. Unfortunately, we are still already beginning to struggle with gas for our car so my partner can get to work, food and household supplies, supplies for our kitties, and my medical expenses. 

below you will see i have created a wishlist for things like food, household supplies, and kitty supplies if you feel so generous as to send anything my way. 
any cash donations would be deeply appreciated and will go to gas for my partners car, my prescriptions, groceries (if needed), and upcoming procedures/appointments. this would be unbelievably helpful. i am comfortable sending any proof I have, should you request it. i’m not shy and, at this point, i will do damn near anything if it means i can keep myself and my partner afloat. 

i can also offer small tokens of appreciation/gratitude (like handmade jewelry and crocheted items, resumè creation and career/interview consulting, a sticker pack from my sticker collection, etc) for your donations. I am limited as to what i can offer as tokens (since i only have so many skills) so DM me if you have something in mind.

Help with tuition before I get sent to collections

I’m a senior in college. I graduate next quarter. My school fucked me over last quarter, causing me to owe $1000 I didn’t need to. 

I had already paid $2k out of pocket and I didn’t have enough to cover the last grand, so they put a hold on my account. I’ve asked for help, even just time, and they won’t help me at all. I’ve paid a couple hundred, and now my balance is at $730. 

On top of this, I owe $1000 to Venmo bc my rent payment bounced, and I’m almost $500 behind on my utilities. I’m barely keeping myself afloat. To afford groceries, I’ve had to sell a bunch of my shit, and take out credit cards to pay rent. 

My school will send me to outside collections on Dec. 30th. I also can’t register for my last two classes until the debt is paid. I will be able to pay a good chunk of it on my next check, but I’m just barely making rent right now, so anything to help would be much appreciated. (I’ve cross posted this bc I’m kinda desperate.)"

,"Fairly new to reddit, embarrassed, last resort, military family","Hi everyone!

I have only been on reddit a few months now and I am not entirely sure how things work around here lol I am currently looking for an apartment after being evicted and living in a motel. The eviction was due to black mold in my bathroom and my landlord refusing to fix it... I didn't pay rent... Now out on the street! My fiance is a veteran and we are working with an organization called veterans INC who are helping us pay the deposit to move into a new place! Thank god!

We pay $500/week at this motel. It is the cheapest we can find. Work hours were short this week for both my fiance and I due to the holiday and weather and we are $100 short to pay the motel. We tried asking for time, they don't want to hear it and we can afford to take any of the money and pay per night @ $75. If we do that we wont have enough to make it through the week. This is embarrassing and last resort as we have asked agencies and family but either it will take time or they can't help.

If anyone can help us we can pay back (if allowed on this sub) thank you for reading and happy turkey day!"

I've spoken dozens of times on the phone with my (ex) insurance provider and sent a mail appeal, to no avail. I'm a student and the money I make goes straight towards living expenses and the care of my pup, who also has an outstanding bill from the vet. In addition to all this, my gyn sent bills to my home address, violating patient confidentiality; I explicitly told the office not to send medical info to my parents' home in order to protect my safety and privacy, and cannot rely upon them for help with the expenses due to their cultural conservatism. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Blessings this holiday season"
,"[request] a hard year has finally led to me needing to reach out. Housefire and illness have left me broke and hungry. (Exeter, UK)","Hi all in this amazing community.

On the first of April this year me and my family suffered a house fire, with my room being most affected. I lost my books and guitar and my clothes were too smoke damaged to be saved. Whilst it was happening I had the most sever panic attack I hope I'll ever have but everyone involved was unharmed, which I'm so thankful for. This did leave me shaken and forced to move however, as there was physically no room anymore. I braved the hit to my overdraft - I had just paid 400 rent to my parents, and then had too add 900 for deposit and first month's rent for the bedsit I am currently in, excluding monthly grocery bills and a few charity shop clothes.

Still fairly stricken and despondent from the fire I was then offered unpaid leave from work which I didn't want to take, but would be able to get some private councelling on behalf of the company so took the chance. I was already worried about finances and over that time are less and less and would still suffer daily/nightly moments of panic and listlessness. I returned to work hoping too focus on it, but in July, after a routine blood test I was admitted to hospital close to a heart attack. As I had let my nutrition slip my electrolyte balance had left me incredibly low in potassium. 

I was put on sick leave by work on half pay for what I believed was 6 months. When last month's pay check came in... well it didnt. This was at the 3 month point. My manager had made a mistake and didn't realise I was an agency worker when I started, meaning I didn't get the 6 months. I have no plans on fighting this as I feel to weak to keep going over it. I have returned to work full-time as I am now maxed out on a credit card and 500 overdrawn, but it is making it hard to organise meeting with my ED support worker (employer is being as flexible as possible however). 

I know the next few months will be hard, but I will recover from this. I have always found it hard to ask for help, but I could really use anything at this point. I have put  together an Amazon wishlist of a few things that would help greatly, as I will only just be able to cover rent this month, and hopefully scrape by in January. If you guys have any suggestions of things I could add from the UK Amazon site then please let me know. I am waiting for a referral for Exeter's Food Bank from my support worker as I have only just braved talking about my finances with them. 

Thank you for your time people, even a kind word means a lot at this point.

,I'm raising money for a student-led free clinic for an underserved medical population.,"Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I am a student pharmacist at Rosalind Franklin University and part of the Executive Officer Board for our student-led free clinic located in North Chicago (known as the Interprofessional Community Clinic). Our clinic functions to provide free health care to the surrounding underserved areas of North Chicago, Waukegan, and Lake Bluff. The patients we treat come from all walks of life including local and immigrant populations.

Every year we organize an event called the Dance for Diabetes. The money we raise through this event is used to fund services and supplies specifically for patients with diabetes (hence D4D). 

What your donation **will** provide to patients:

* Diabetic testing supplies (lancets, glucometers, test strips, Sharps containers for proper needle disposal)

* Lab work (Chem-7 panels, lipid panels, HbA1c testing, etc)

* Immunizations (3 series Hepatitis B, pneumonia, etc)

What your donation **will not** be used for:

* Employee salaries

* student monetary compensation

* any administration costs

* any cost or charge that does not directly involve the patient with diabetes.

As I am fundraising directly through my school's Mobile Cause, I will not be receiving any form of compensation nor will I have access to the funds that are donated even though my name is attached to the page. The donation page is here: https://app.mobilecause.com/vf/ICCLINIC/MaximilianVitas

[This link will take you to our clinic's website](https://www.rfuclinics.com/services/caring-for-our-community/interprofessional-community-clinic/patient-services/) where you can learn a bit more about what we do, such as the services we provide.

I’m unhealthy as can be and I’m about to lose my apartment and need food. I lost my mother earlier this year and am totally by myself in this mess. Also, unable to work if I want to keep medicaid and stay on dialysis. It’s really screwed up how the government will penalize you for trying.  Just trying here. Anything donated is a blessing and such a great help and I’ve never needed it more. I thank you all for looking and please share the word as that may be the biggest help in this.

He took a way lesser job, and we incurred a lot of debt because of this.

,Friend's Health Issues,"Good day,

tl:dr I have a friend in Kansas who is having heath issues. She doesn't know where they stem from, but she has been unable to work because of them.

"" I have been very ill the last few months. It started with bronchitis and pneumonia, and that caused a cascade of other hidden ailments. I'm severely anemic, and though I was treating it, it apparently wasn't enough. It raised my iron levels, but my red blood cells are too small, so for the last year my organs have not been receiving adequate oxygen. I'm on a higher dose of iron now, but no results yet. It can take months to work, and given that treatment didn't work after a year, I may need transfusions down the road. I also found out I have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a serious form of fatty liver disease. Luckily we found it before cirrhosis set in. I'm still undergoing testing to see what else might be wrong.

Basically, I'm in pretty much constant pain, have frequent nausea, get dehydrated easily, and can't get very far away from a restroom at any given time. I'll spare you the details, but there doesn't seem to be a pattern to when an attack might occur, so I can't just plan around it. Even light housework and running errands can leave me bedridden for a day or longer. Because of this, I haven't been able to work for months and I'm not sure when I can go back.

I don't have insurance and the medical bills and regular expenses are piling up. My savings are completely dried up. Steven has been a huge help. He picks up shifts when he can, takes care of our dog, cooks, and does pretty much all the housework. Unfortunately, one income just isn't enough.

We're applying for SNAP (food stamps) and assistance for rent and utilities, but it's taking a long time, and most places will only help once in a 12-month period. Anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated.""

,Advice for small charity helping to combat child trafficking in Haiti,"I'm trying to help my parent's charity increase donations. Right now, they're at around $1,400 per month, but want to grow it to $9,100 per month. This will allow my parents to draw a $1,500/month salary. 

Right now, they're operating Loving The Least of These Ministries International, which currently has one orphanage in Haiti. There are 15 children, 9 staff, and one house to pay for. My parents have never had money and are now using their life savings to pay for the charity's expenses. My Dad has Stage IV head and neck cancer, so he's unable to work. I'm not looking for a pity party, I just want to communicate how much of a struggle this has been for them.

I've decided to scale back on my personal work and responsibilities to help with the charity. I'd like to begin approaching podcasters and bloggers for interviews to get my mom featured. She's an incredible story teller and has been speaking at events and conferences in cities across North America for over a decade now. I'd also like to begin approaching businesses to commit to monthly donations (from $100 - $1,000) and in exchange, we'll have the children of the orphanage draw pictures specifically for the corporate sponsors each month. In addition, we can name the company as a sponsor when my mom goes to speak at events.

I understand this is not much in the way of a lucrative offer for corporate sponsors, but at this point, there's not much else we can afford that I can think of.

&#x200B;

So I'm wondering if anyone has any experience or advice that would be valuable? My dad built the website, which you can check out here [lovingtheleaseofthese.org](https://lovingtheleaseofthese.org).

,My mental health is deteriorating more and more. I desperately need therapy but can not afford it. Any help is appreciated,"Heya. If you want more details you can check my post history but the short version is: 

I’m a recent grad. I got screwed over for a job (was promised it, but turns out I was lied to) right after graduation. Ever since I’ve been struggling to find work (I.e. can’t) and had to move back to my parents house in rural east Texas.  Where there is no work. At all. I cannot drive (thanks to a bit of trauma related circumstances).  The only places hiring at this town have queer-phobic managers and I’m openly queer.   The only way I could even have a shot at work is if I lied and recloseted myself, which I don’t think would be possible.  
I don’t have savings because all my earnings had to go towards tuition and my therapy while in college. I don’t have health insurance and Texas didn’t expand Medicaid so I can’t get it. 

I really need work too since I have income taxes coming up (which I have to pay from my work-study job last semester) and loan payments in January.  

Thankfully my loans only total $1300. But that’s still not anything I can pay right now. 

So basically anything you contribute will go towards me paying for the Skype sessions with a therapist (since the nearest therapist to me is a 45 minute drive away), or my loans/taxes. 

My paypal is https://www.paypal.me/shadow2039 

I also have cash app and Venmo if that’d be preferable for you. 

Any little bit helps.

,Please help me out leave Venezuela,"Hello! My name is Daniela, I want to give you a piece of my life for you to read about, if you wish! I do not want to take much of your time but you would help me a lot if you stay.

I'm a Venezuelan girl, I am 25 years old and I'm currently living in Portuguesa. I'm living with my mother, my grandmother and my two elder siblings right now.

Living with them hasn't been the easiest task in the world. I barely have any patience, as their personalities and attitudes are abusive and violent towards each other and myself, to the point where I just close myself in my room to avoid interactions with them.

I struggle with depression and, as usual, my mother thinks of it as a serious issue but my siblings take me as a joke, and my brother even encouraged me to just cut my veins and bleed out to death to do them a favor, since they are sick of me. He said it while we fought, since I had told him that he should respect we shared different political views, but his answer was that, and everything went to shit after that. When I got older, and asked family for help, they would say no with the argument that ""taking my side would betting against my mother"" and they would never do such thing to avoid having family issues.

The hardship of living in a country whose economy prevents anyone from being able to live by themselves, since the hyper-inflation makes any salary worthless.

As the situation got worse, my friends started to flee the country, and you might have heard about this on the news. It's a massive amount of Venezuelans that have left the country.

Now, a couple of years later and with the country in economic crisis, I decided I couldn't stay here even if I couldn't leave myself. I had always said to myself to leave with my own money and savings, but that is very hard since at home, my salary is controlled by them, who check my accounts and learn how much I earn, and then use that amount entirely as if it were theirs.

I might be told to talk to them about this and look for a civil way to finish with this abusive nonsense, but last time I tried, they almost beat me up in front of my best friends because I had tried to go to the movies without asking permission, and stood up for myself against my siblings over them saying I couldn't. I had told them I was a 20 year old woman in college, who wasn't even asking them for money, and got my hair pulled, locked away in my room and yelled at for a couple of hours with my friends present.

You can imagine what that did to my personal life and my depression, but the fact that I'm single is the least of my problems.

Leaving my country to live somewhere else has been my life plan ever since I finished high school, yet I was forced by my family to study a career I thought was not for me (it was communications, and I struggle with social anxiety and stage fright, so I thought it'd be a waste). I had been rejected by the colleges I had applied to study odontology and psychology, so I decided to go with it, and graduated two years ago. However, they had The country itself has a minimum wage worth about 3-5 dollars, and the issues we are having with the economy make me unable to save up.

Usually, most Venezuelans sell their houses, cars or phones in exchange of dollars to pay their bus rides, and then cross to either Colombia or Brazil to leave. I lack any goods to actually get rid of, so I felt I was stuck. Finding a job is very hard, since many companies are closing due to their inability to afford paying so many workers, and the ones that are staying are usually crowded with applicants, which makes it harder to be selected for one, albeit the increased lack of young people with a career and experience.

Also, as a journalist living in a country where the dictatorship government is blocking any content online and depend on VPN's to navigate the web normally, it's very hard to find a job in your career and not be fired due to talking about a political subject that is forbidden, so I have worked as an informal teacher, in radio and as a virtual assistant to help at home. With my paternal figure currently struggling to pay for his chemotherapy and struggling with POC, I made a decision. I simply just cannot stay here and not ask anyone for help.

I am sure that I would be able to leave this toxic place and work my ass off to get money and help my family and my uncle with his chemotherapy. My plan is to leave my country by bus, and immigrate to Colombia legally.

I will add [**here**](https://www.paypal.me/daniale1994) my PayPal.Me link, if there is a way I can get some help to pay for my travels and bus ride until I arrive to Bucaramanga.

Since many Venezuelans struggle with money here as well, dollars have become a well-used currency to make sure no one suffers the hyper-inflation as much, a legal way to help me is through PayPal.

I know it was a long story and maybe you have no way to help me, I know we all struggle differently no matter the country, but if you can, share this and maybe someone you know might help me.

I am a hardworking woman who lost her job a couple of months ago, and due to the current situation, we barely can afford anything to eat at home. The abusive behavior from my family has developed into a fight over food, which is saddening and makes me frustrated.

I wish there was more that I could say, but that would be too much. I just hope you have a good day and I wish everyone who takes time to read this the best.

Sincerely, a woman who got tired of not accepting anyone's help."
,Need help with paying my rent this month,"Hello everyone. I've been out of a job since September 23rd this year and have been actively looking every day. I've gone to interviews, done various phone screenings and even thought I was set and had a job last week (turns out the job wasn't really guaranteed and even though the small company technically hired a group of us, the day before the official first day he decided on only hiring 5 people and I wasn't one of them)

I'm continuously searching and have even applied for unemployment in the beginning of October but I still haven't received any funds. I've called numerous times and keep being told they are just waiting on someone to review it and process it (currently on my 3rd week claiming and still nothing). I finally got hold of the employee reviewing my claim this morning and he just asked me a few questions about my former employer and then told me he'd send a copy of the report but didn't give me an answer if my claim would finally come through.

It's almost the end of the month and my rent due date is up and coming again. I'm not entirely sure if i'd be able to get a job before then and even if I do, I do not think I would be payed in time to pay the rent before the due date.. (it's due in 6 days now)

I don't have anywhere else to turn to or anyone else that can help me so that is why I am posting a request on here. I apologize but I really need the help. If anyone can spare anything it would help me out a lot. The total for my rent is $770

any payments can be sent to my paypal at castrod606@gmail.com

Thank you for your time

Edit: I live in Portland, Oregon and was able to pay my rent this month with the help of a local church as they covered a partial payment if I had the rest of the money for rent 

Update: 10/22/19 Called Unemployment 3 times today and left a message as they didn't pick up on any of them. When I went to check my claim status it said denied and I plan to call them again tomorrow to see what the hell is going on..

Update: 10/23/19 Filed an appeal against my denial for unemployment

Update: 10/29/19 I haven't heard a peep from unemployment so I plan to call them to see what is going on with the appeal. Still no luck on jobs though I have a few interviews later on this week so hoping crosses fingers

Edit: I also posted this on r/need with no luck so far.. 6 days left before rent is due"
,Help?,"Hi Reddit,

Before I get into it, I'd like to say that I haven't used this account in 4 years because life has been happening, but I have been lurking without actually logging in. I felt like I had to say that because I know redditors and in posting here I run the risk of being put under a microscope. It's like returning to a friend and asking for help when you haven't been a good friend to them in a long time (pretty much accurate in my life too, now that I think about it). 

I don't have any social media, except Instagram (@thatunknownpoet) so there's no way for me to broadcast this to my friends via a social media platform. I am posting this as I don't feel capable of doing anything about my situation today, as I am too sad (but I do plan to take action). 

So thank YOU, for just reading THIS - that in itself means a lot to me and if you are unable to donate, a kind word or even a kind thought in my direction would be as appreciated and equal in my eyes as any donation ❤️

The full story is explained in on the donation page here:
https://gogetfunding.com/pressured-to-resign-by-hr-the-h-stands-for-human/
 
Here's a summary:

I returned to work and had a meeting with HR to discuss my dwindling sick leave balance, under the assumption that we were going to try and find a way for me to continue working and they'd use other types of leave (for which my balances were reasonable) in the event that I fall ill again.

Instead, HR bullied me into resigning on the spot. The reason for using more than usual amounts of sick leave in a 16 month period was due to the fact that I had been diagnosed with bipolar 2 just before I started working there. I was not aware of the difficulties that came with being put on psychotic medication, my ""journey to trying to find the right fit"" of meds actually caused many days of not being able to function. The side effects of the meds actually far outweighed the symptoms of the BP2 and I tried my best until I eventually stopped taking them (after about a year of trying). 

A few days here and there for the above, plus when I got physically sick, it was usually flu/an ailment that required bedrest and 3-5 days off at a time, which didn't help my case either.

The meeting with HR (oh and this was my first ever meeting with them, no prior interactions) was horrible because I was in tears and at one point begging for my job, but was advised that it was better that I leave now, because I will most likely be sick again soon and then they will be ""forced"" to start an incapacity hearing in which I would lose my job anyway, just in a long lengthy process that they were sure I would not be able to handle. But of course, they couldn't ""tell me to resign, it was my choice"". I didn't feel like it was my choice. Even when I initially chose to stay, they didn't let me stick to my guns by asking me if I could confirm, without any doubt that I wouldn't be sick again next week. I'm BAD with confrontation and sticking up for myself and I allowed myself to go into a self-pitying state in which I just gave up. But I shouldn't have given in so easily, because now I'm screwed financially and I had to leave my apartment (at a hefty lease cancelation fee) and move in with my grandmother. 

All my debt totals approximately $850.

As I said, I'm not planning on relying on donations, so in meantime:

I recently started making very unique earrings and the feedback when I wear them myself is quite positive, so hopefully I can sell them at an outside market in my town. Maybe I'll try painting some abstract paintings (it's been awhile) and have my bf make frames for them to sell... But yeah, I'm pretty much broke BROKE now, I had to sell a few things to make my lease cancelation payment, and trust me when I say, there is nothing left to sell.

Thank you for your time, I wish you well.

Edit: forgot to mention that 50% of any excess funds raised will go to Sive Nathi Children's home, and should I manage to make up the amount myself I will donate a bigger percentage. 50% of excess because I found a counselor who works on a donation basis and now I don't have medical aid to see my psychologist/psychiatrist"

,Crypto-Philanthropy," 

To run a successful organization, raising and managing funds are paramount. Donations are the fueling need for nonprofits to survive for longer periods. There are multiple methods and platforms both online and offline for nonprofits to ask for donations. So the fundraising took the internet by storm in this digital era using different concepts.

Fundraising is the lifeblood of charities and is of great importance to nonprofits. Most nonprofit/nongovernmental organizations rely on fundraising to cover the costs of campaigns and programs driving social impact.

**Bitcoin fundraising**

Over the last few years, a large number of charities and foundations have been trialing Bitcoin donations. These include well-known organizations like the Red Cross, Save the Children, United Way, the Wikimedia Foundation, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Once established, an online “wallet” allows charity institutions to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrency donations and these are later exchanged for fiat currencies such as the dollar. In some cases, online wallet providers offer 0% processing fees for nonprofits, compared to the 2% or more required by traditional donation processors. This means, potentially 100% of donations can end up in the pockets of charity organizations or donation recipients. Bitcoin donations to charities are also tax-deductible and offer donors the added benefit of avoiding capital gains taxes on the dollar amount value of their cryptocurrency donations.

In the United States, it is difficult to say how much money has been generated through bitcoin and other digital currency donations. There is evidence to suggest that bitcoin transactions are on the rise. Fidelity Charitable, which houses the nation’s largest donor-advised fund, reportedly received $89 million in cryptocurrency donations in 2018, up from $75 million received in 2015, 2016 and 2017 combined.

In addition to direct digital currency donations, there are a variety of other innovative and unique platforms and projects underway in the emerging “crypto-philanthropy” space.

**Conclusion**

If there is greater transparency in giving and impact does lead to increased confidence in charities, Millions (or even billions) of dollars more could be generated for the social sector.

Now is the time for philanthropists, foundations, and nonprofits to come together with social entrepreneurs, blockchain visionaries, and technologists to collectively guide the direction of crypto-philanthropy. The future of giving is for all of us to imagine and create, built on our common love of giving back.

,"Let go from a great job for being gay, need help with bills.","This is my first post here, so I'm not super sure how Reddit works but a friend recommended me to post on this subreddit (?) for my problems. A little backstory- I'd moved pretty far from home to attend university, and I'm the first person in my family to be able to do so. I'd worked hard all through high school and took a gap year so I could at least attempt to pay for it, and it it wasnt for the VA bill that cuts my tuition down thanks to my dad, I wouldnt be here at all.

I had a really nice job for awhile, and I was pretty good friends with the owner for a solid year. I went back home over the summer and came back this year, and I got let go three weeks ago. I heard from the manager I normally work with that the owner actually honest to god despised me since I was openly gay, and was just waiting for me to slip up so he could let me go, but since he couldnt find that, he hired someone else and let me train my replacement on my last shift- when I didnt even know it was my replacement OR my last shift until I clocked out and my manager told me. I didn't have another job lined up, since it was very sudden, and despite my pavement pounding, I have yet to receive an interview anywhere. I'm attributing this to college season, and every place even within a half hour walk is just... full. I don't have a functional car, which limits me pretty badly, especially in the winter.

I hate asking for help, but at this point I've postponed my medical bills, phone bill, and rent for as long as I possibly can. I do art commissions on the side for extra income, but it's neither steady enough or consistent enough for me to rely on yet. I'm pinning my hopes on this post, that someone with a kind soul will see and send me maybe even $5 so I can pick up some food for my apartment. Even if I were to get a job today, it would still be another two or three weeks before I got a paycheck, and its tearing me apart. My family is going through a messy divorce, to the point where they dont even know I lost my job, because it would stress them out even more. I grew up pretty poor, and with me out of the way, they're barely able to scrape by themselves, so I cant bring myself to ask them for help knowing I'd be putting their livelihoods on the line.


Tldr; I lost the only job I had for being gay, and I'm running out of time to pay bills and put food on the table. Anything helps.

,My friend is in a really tough spot and is taking it like a legend. Check out her story.,
,Scammed and robbed,"Hey guys. Recently me and my best friend of 20 years (the woman I care for) decided to move to another state together. We set up everything online and thought we were going to be okay.

We got to the location we thought we were renting and found out that we had been scammed and lost a lot of money. Not long after that the packages we sent with all our belongings was stolen after being dropped by UPS. We tried to get any assistance from the community here but as it turns out convicted felons take priority over a disabled woman who lost her wheelchair.
We're currently homeless, very dirty and very hungry. I've personally walked over 30 miles in 2 days looking for any assistance but the programs that are available all refuse to help.
I'm looking for any advice or help that might help us in our current situation."
,Tough situations poisoned homeless and no place for warmth,"Trying to get over poisoning these bad people did to me all because they saw me talking to the police and they thought it was about their drug dealings I quickly ran from there and thought I found a safe place while the innocent sounding lady in a few towns and many miles away rented me a room to try to get over the nasty symptoms of the poison since the hospitals refused to help me well I exhausted every penny I had doing this and now I'm outside with just what I could carry and nowhere to go because this lady was confronted by the landlord and she said I was just visiting and said that I refused to leave which was a lie so he called the police they didn't care I had a signed written agreement for rent room and board she had me removed I am out everything and in the weather feeling sick I really need a few more vitamins soon I was told if I caught the symptoms early the vitamins will lessen the damage the poison causes but said I have to act very quickly and don't stop taking the a c and e vitamins. the hospitals aren't helping I been to two different hospitals eight different times, wvu Ruby and Fairmont regional medical center all Ruby did was try to say it was a mental illness and said I was irrational and surrounded me and made me strip my clothes and held me down and shot me up with something I said I was poisoned and need to be tested for poison they said we can't do that then one lady blurted out yes we can but have to send it off they were trying to make me sound crazy had lots of blood in my stool, severe pains in organs, lungs, heart, and kindney since I first suspected something. I left Bridgeport wv today bound for Clarksburg made it I just didn't make it in time before 4 to the courts or magistrate for the civil issue with putting me on the street after making a written and signed agreement and paying rent, the lady kept all my rent and gave the next door neighbors my food and anything edible that I bought, she even had the nerve to tell the police and the landlord that I locked myself in the bathroom and said I wasn't coming out when I went in there to change my shirt to something warmer and use the bathroom. Her name is Nikki Hamilton on East main Street in Bridgeport. If anyone can donate any amount i don't mind if it's even a dollar to get what I need it would be greatly appreciated or anyome out there that can get vitamins A, C, and E or a blanket or sleeping bag if possible I would be forever greatful and will pay it back as soon as I can.

This is the first and also the last offer I can give this world this  civilization at global public level with full world view with search  engine record. If the the previous offer I targeted the ?big  player/group?, then this final offer I target everybody with much lesser  amount of cryptocurrency to give everybody in this world one last final  chance before the doomdays by natural gods releasing power. 

**Conditions & Requirements:**   
\- 999 BTC Bitcoin   
\- Bitcoin Address: bc1q0zmpsh85pexzh3nj2ywkhcmfl6y29ecp2ugw4t

**In Exchange For A Perfect Solution:**   
\- Solve the trade war, economic crisis between East & West,  between team Capitalism & team Socialism. Here include many nations  like North Korea, Iran, USA, China, Japan, etc.   
The card & solution i have is too powerful that enemy must follow or face complete collapse & isolation. 

Remember only economic problems because that is the root of major  conflict between nations at this moment on Earth. No any other problems  & subject like Climate Change, Ascension, etc. 

Many groups, governments are making brutal mistakes, they are  digging history actions, instead of seeking for solution. They are  trying to kill to disease instead of finding the answer where is the  disease come from. 

Arrest corruption, bad beings/people then for what? Just to cause the chaos and trouble in civil life.   
Where the ?corruption, bad? people come from & why? Because of  the current system not working anymore, it do not adapt the new  situation. 

The enemy of people is not just the authority but also all kind of  groups, organizations who do not know what is enough, when to stop. 

This final offer also going to unveil and tell the public, the evil  is including many of so patriot group themselves. They have spent money  to cause chaos but let see if they willing to spend money for permanent  solution to save everybody. 

This is also key for all beings with super-power come to play after  the deadline. Frankly, if super-beings really want, all the rubbish  under ocean, climate change, etc. can disappear in fraction of a second. 

So if you are people, group who have moral and want to save this  civilization this world, then go donation BTC to above Bitcoin address. I  promise and guarantee to refund if the total amount not reach my  requirement, also provide perfect solution to satisfy both team in the  conflict.   
Team do not donate going to receive natural catastrophe and  eliminated on the game, so choose wisely, the cost is very little but  have so much gain, this is the best chance to remove the enemy out of  map. 

You can trust me as the savior of this world or not, it is up to  you. This is the final best offer I can give this civilization. This is  one time post, I am not going to answer any question for it does not  solve anything. This civilization this world must choose go with God or  go against God. It is all up to you.

,Need a Used Smartphone,"My husbands broke his iPhone and we cannot afford to get it fixed right now. My husband had stroke about two weeks ago and after 7 days of not waking up or responding he is now up and talking. That’s being said, due to the stroke he is suffering from some left side paralysis and he needs to retrain some of his reflexes. This means he will be in rehab for an undetermined amount of time. He needs a phone so he can make calls,listen to his iTunes and go online. The music thing is especially important for him. He is a huge music lover and listening to music is one of the only things that is motivating him and lifting his spirits right now. I don’t care what kind of smartphone it is, it just needs to be compatible with AT&T or unlocked. It doesn’t have to be in perfect condition cosmetically either. Thank you in advance for any help that is offered."

,Request to prevent eviction," 

Right now I am in dire need of a bit of assistance with my rent. If I don’t have the full amount to them tomorrow, then I will get evicted. I have nearly everything I need but not quite. 

I’ve had a seriously tough couple of years. I lost my Mom in 2015 and I’m still having to pay to sort out probate issues with her things. I went through a bad and long (and expensive) divorce from a manipulative and frightening man after a 10 year marriage. He stole all of our savings and left me with a ton of bills. Then I had to move quickly with all my pets and belongings from a house I thought I’d raise my children in and live for the rest of my life. Luckily I found a new place to live but rent has been difficult the past two months. I didn’t have transportation at all due to an awful car accident (didn’t get anything back since it was an old 90s volvo). I recently found a decent truck to purchase and it was doing great - until it wasn’t all of a sudden - so now I’m still not even sure what the issue is (hoping it isn’t the transmission) but I had to pay to get it towed an hour back to my house. That, along with previously helping my elderly Dad out with a few necessary living expenses, has unexpectedly put me behind in my very tight budget over the past couple months. I’ve borrowed from friends and family, which has been really difficult for me and I’ve lost a lot of pride, but I had to do what I could to survive... I have loans against my 401k. Several things with the divorce process (longer story) has made my credit awful and my one credit card left is maxed and I can’t seem to get any loans. I’m not sure where else I can turn at this point… 

I am employed full time and I’ve been picking up extra hours, so I managed to pay August rent late (along with court eviction filing fees and extra late fees from my rental company). Now I am trying my best to get the September rent paid by tomorrow to prevent the eviction/lock out from proceeding. I would deeply appreciate any help at all to keep me from losing my home. Please message me if you can help me at all…"

,I need money to pay my dog's surgery.,"Hello, reddit!

My name is Nico and I'm 20yo. I am currently studying at a university in Germany (paid by the government) and can bearly afford rent with the minijob and the freelancing money I make. When I moved out from my abusive parents two years ago, they made me take my dog Bella with me. They threatened to kill her otherwise and since I know and love her since I was 13, I had no choice but take her. I always assure that she's fine and got everything she needs, although I kind of have to cut down my own meals sometimes, but that's pretty much okay for me (I take enough care of myself that I don't really suffer critical problems from it). The thing is that Bella got a tore cruciate which required an operation. I don't have the money to pay the treatment but she's the only thing in this world I've really loved probably the only thing keeping me alive right now. Including the whole procedure and medication, the vet wants 2650€ in exchange of a prognosis of another two or three years. I don't know how to prove to you that this is a legit request and I do know that this is a horrendous amount of money I 'm asking for and I'm sorry for not being able to handle this shit myself. I'm aware that it's very unlikely to find someone who will be able and willing to pay that, but this is my last straw, so for Bella I cling to the hope. Everyone helping is a freaking saint to me.

I'd take anything at this point, donation, gift, car you don't use anymore,monetary donation, anything helps. I am so desperate to give my babies the life they deserve and unfortunately the places I have the strength to walk to to apply to have not called me back, so now I have to venture out and go a farther distance to apply to places.

,Sulfadimethoxine needed for kitten,"Hello All,
Long story short, i am looking for someone to donate a small amount of Sulfadimethoxine to me so that i may treat a kitten. I rescued a kitten from the middle of a busy highway, and have decided to keep him as part of our family, but he is having bloody stool that is indicative of a coccidia infection. He is tiny, maybe a few weeks old. I do not have the money at this time to take him to a vet or pay for medicine, and was hoping someone could donate some Sulfadimethoxine or equivalent sulfa drug so that i could treat him now. It would only require a tiny amount, as he is super small. I can handle dividing/administering the correct dose. Maybe someone has a single pill or 2 left after their own animals treatment... it could be broken into doses good for a tiny kitten. Please if you have extra, donate to me so that i may treat this kitten. 
Thanks!

,Help my mom,"My mom is a very sweet person, hard-working, passionate. She has a kid’s shop, full of colorful toys, and always a smile on her face. But the shop doesn’t work at all. She tries with all her might, comes up with new ideas to give it a new life, but it always come down with a fail. She never gave up, even after all these years, but she is giving up now.

It’s suffocating her, and any energy she has left. Last year, she had a stroke, and her mental health had got even worse. She feels like she never bring home money, and all she does fails. She started losing her passion, is depressive, and cry every night.

She got good ideas, and is very talented, but unfortunately, without money you can’t start anything. This month, she even struggles to pay the rent of her shop. So, as a last straw i will try asking help.

Honestly, there is nothing i wanna do more than help her myself, but there is nothing left for me to do. I’m in another country, all I can do is do well in my studies, make her proud, and listen to her.

I don’t really ask for much. I just wanna know that my story was heard, and that some people care. At least help her a little with paying her rent this month.

,Help me to keep on swimming,"**Cervical spondylosis** is a general term for age-related wear and tear affecting the spinal disks in one's neck. As the disks dehydrate and shrink, signs of osteoarthritis develop, including bony projections along the edges of bones (bone spurs).

In my case, it is not age-related, as I am only 30 years old and have been experiencing first symptoms from the age of 16. Genetic factors have influenced the development of the condition in my case.

At this point, my spinal cord and nerve roots have become severely compressed as a result of cervical spondylosis, and the damage is permanent.

Currently, I am experiencing continuous pain in my neck, upper spine and right shoulder blade. Headaches are my daily companion. My right hand is not always functional and is often without a sensation of touch. It is difficult to work as I am not able to sit for a long time without experiencing quite a lot of pain. It is difficult to drive for me, even dangerous as I often lose the sense of touch in my right hand.

However, I do not want to give up an accept the deterioration of my living conditions. I am doing everything I can to minimize the effect of the condition on the quality of my everyday life and slow down the development of any further side effects. I want to work and provide for myself and am looking into ways to slow down the further development of the condition.

This is where I would very much appreciate your help. Please, support me in providing:

\- supplements necessary for the regeneration of my nerves and cartilage (Vitamin B, Vitamin D, Calcium, Glucosamine, Collagen, etc...) which I need daily

\- continuous chiropractic and osteopathic therapy

\- continuous physical therapy

If you are in a position to offer me remote work, as I am experiencing continuous periods of not being able to move a lot, I would be more than grateful. Please do get in touch!

If you have any experience in dealing with cervical spondylosis and are willing to share some advice, I would very much appreciate it!

In the words of the ever so optimistic Dora the fish: ""Just keep swimming!"" :)

Only if her huge infection drops from her body , the medical staff may try something else about the relapsed tumor (we still do not know what 😔) to ease the body of Sultana.
The antibiotic is, I quote ... ""REVOLUTIONARY"" ... but a single bottle that must be given daily (at least 3-5 days, after 2 -3 days already appearing and its effect) costs around 180-200 of law ... 😔
We need to decide as soon as possible ... we can urgently start his administration ... but ... we need financial support for it ... we can start ... we need to be sure you will be with us one more time ... let's try to save her ...
WHAT TO DO?!? HOW TO PROCEED?!? 😔😪💔

,Was being harassed at my job and had to quit. Now I'm unemployed and need help.,"Recently, I had to quit my job because I was victim of harassment. I need to start submitting my CV and do a lot of documentation to get a new job, and sadly my laptop broke a year ago. This was a terrible time to quit, but the harassment got so bad I had no choice. 200$ would be enough to get the cheapest laptop and make the application process easier. I'm only asking for the tools to make this process less costly since I have a limited budget from my last paycheck (cyber cafes are expensive where I live, and printing and transport take a lot of my budget). Please DM me if you can offer help, anything will be appreciated!

Edit: I changed the price because of shipping costs, but if I can find a cheaper one, I will let you know! I plan to make the order via Amazon global shipping."

,Help me getting back on my feet.,"Hi, Reddit friends.

Last month my house got struck by lightning. Luckily nobody is hurt and no major damage to the house itself. But the problem is when it hits my place, most of the electrical stuff are fried/broken. My refrigerator, my TV, and my laptop. I lost most of my work and college files in it too.

I have been struggling this past few weeks to fix how things are before this happened, but it's just hard to keep up. Beside my missing files that I have to make from scratch again, I am struggling to raise money to replace what is broken. Why? Because I am a student and a freelancer at the same time. I depends my life on my laptop for my work, for my entertainment, and other things. Without it, I can't do jobs and without jobs I can't raise money to fix things up. I am even barely made it to raise money for my tuition.

So here I want to ask for your help. I would love to ask for money donation, but that would be selfish and low, that's why I decided against it. What I want to ask is, please give me something to do and pay me for it. For a note, I am a freelancer for translating texts from English to Bahasa Indonesia, or vice versa. I can also do transcription jobs for you to transcribe Bahasa Indonesia audio files. (I am a native Indonesian and proficient on written English)

For any of you that would like to give me an opportunity, please, please leave a reply or message me. I am really on my wit's end and I don't know where else to go at the moment.

Thank you for all those who read this to the end. Also thank you for your consideration. I would be waiting for your responses."

I take care of my youngest siblings since my Mom has passed away and it has been tough adjusting to this new life. I can pay back if necessary, but just a hand to get back up. All the people I have asked for help have either said no because of their personal lives or just didn’t respond. I am more worried about the well being of my siblings than myself. Just need some help. 

Thank you for hearing me out, and stay blessed."

,Desperately Need Help To Get Out Of Crisis | All Help Would Be Appreciated,"To all the generous members of this sub-reddit,

I am a 30-year-old guy from Pakistan. I've been working as a freelance web content writer from home for the past 11-12 years. Presently, I am primarily supporting my household, which includes my parents. There have been a lot of ups and downs in my life, perhaps even some highs, but somehow I've managed to help make ends meet.

Shortly before April though, I wound up losing a major source of my income. So, I decided to invest some money into my own blog/website, for which I had to purchase a domain and web hosting. I was fairly certain and hopeful that I'd finally manage to earn a decent monthly income, while also creating something of my own.

Unfortunately, I haven't managed to earn anything feasible from it. Yet, I haven't given up hope and am working hard on getting it off the group. My blog/website is just 3 months old, so I am still hopeful and positive that this venture will eventually prove to be fruitful. I am also an author and I've published some erotica, but it isn't too lucrative yet either.

Getting to the point though. I know this may sound bad and wrong, but for my own personal reasons, I had to lie to my parents and I've claimed that I've managed to earn $1,200 over the course of the past 2 months or so. It may not make sense why to you, but although I'm the one earning, my father handles the household budgeting and financing.

Hence, considering that I do not have $1,200, I now find myself in a crisis. Once again, it is too complicated to explain, but my parents will flip if they discover that I do not have the money I claim to, which will lead to dire circumstances. Consequently, I've been experiencing tremendous anxiety and depression since the past week or so. I don't mean to exaggerate or gain unfair sympathies but I've been feeling a bit suicidal because I feel like my world is collapsing around me, which may end up being true.

The reason I decided to state all of the above is to explicity present my current situation and why I decided to post here, and also for the sake of utmost transparency. I know that there are probably far more deserving causes and charities that deserve attention and monetary assistance. I never imagined that I'd find myself in a situation like this, but I'm utterly desperate and panicking.

TL;DR: I am in desperate need of coming up anywhere between **$800** and **$1,200** within the next few days. I know this practically impossible, but this is kind of my last resort, so I thought I'd give it a try, in any case.

The money I receive is supposed to go towards my household expenses and rent for the month of August 2019. This is somewhat unrelated, but my father was recently diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes, so I need to begin saving money for his surgery as well. If manage to get through this crisis and raise enough money, I have vowed to turn my life around and secure a more stable source of income.

As I am in Pakistan, I cannot create a GoFundMe at the moment, but I will ask a friend of mine in the U.S. to do so. Once again, I know it is probably impossible to raise **$1,200** within 3 to 4 days but if anyone here might be generous enough to contribute any sort of amount in order to get me out of this predicament, here is the PayPal email of the same friend: roswell250@hotmail.com

To anyone who decides to help me out, I will be forever be grateful and obliged. I may not be able to pay you back, perhaps, but I promise to pay it forward some day. While it is not mandatory, if anyone does decide to transfer an amount, it would be helpful if you could leave a comment below and mention the amount. That way I could inform my friend and above all, thank you for your contribution.

I am really afraid and panicking, and feel really helpless and don't know what to do. It's like all the happiness has been sucked out of my life because as I've stated, my life might as well be literally over, and I don't mean to exaggerate. Anyhow, I won't drag this any further.

Kind Regards and utmost gratitude to anyone who may help."

Gear, food, treats, toys, etc. None of it is for me, just him, because while I can justify not giving myself anything, he saves my life on a daily basis and I just want him to be as happy and healthy as possible.

,Natalie Needs,"My daughter’s name is Natalie Frutiger. She is 22 months old. Natalie was born with **Vesicoureteral reflux** condition that causes **Urinary Track Infections** in females. This also causes the kidney to become damaged every time she gets an **UTI**. She has fought over 22 months now but not getting better. Since her last trip to  
the urologist they now recommend her to get surgery to prevent any further damage to the kidney.  

During the course of this battle she requires a lot of special needs for preventative measures. These things are requested by the doctor for her to prevent getting a **UTI**:  
 

Water base wipes 

All cotton diapers- can’t use pull ups anymore 

Rash cream 

Anti-biotic daily 

Natalie has also developed sicknesses as any normal condition of children as well. Of course, this also costs as like any other child. She has frequent trips to urgent care and if the symptoms are similar to UTI they have to undergo a catheter to test the urine which is very traumatizing for a baby. I have discovered her medical insurance is now terminated. An insurance must be purchased that will cover her surgery and there has been no luck with Covered California.  

We would like to get funds to help get Natalie the necessary items that requested by doctors as well her basic items. We need to raise money for the health insurance that will cover her medical visits and hopefully surgery. Natalie needs food and starting to outgrow her shoes.    

Recently, I have lost my job and was denied unemployment. An appeal has been made but will be a while before getting a decision. Her mother doesn’t work but 8-12 hours per week and is based on the needs of the employer. I have been searching for 2 months looking for work and have not received any offers.   If there are any jobs in the San Diego area that can set me up with an interview that would also help. 

Your support would be GREATLY appreciated and forever grateful. I am praying everyday and hope you can too! If you can’t support right now it would be just as great to please post on your Facebook timeline to help  
spread the word.  We love our daughter with all our hearts and would love to see she has a chance at a normal life. These funds are going to be logged as purchases are made. 

Sincerely,

Paul Frutiger"

,Need an air compressor willing to create a job for myself," Hello.  Got my diploma of bachelor's degree in engineering and now I am  unemployed for a while, actively looking for a job but its quite hard to  find where i live, need to wait for an open vacancies and day by day my  last savings are melting.

I am big  enthusiast on cars, computers and technology. Learned how to fix them by  myself when I was in high school. After high school graduation I  started working in automotive industry, worked as a mechanic,  technician, manager in automotive parts store and went to college  part-time. Last year was a bit tough because I had to go often on unpaid  vacation to work on my final work in college and then got fired because  of that. In this situation everything I can do is look for a job.

Friend  suggested me to work on cars while I'm looking for the job in  engineering and will allow me to use his garage what I see as an  opportunity. I want to start body-repairs on cars because I very liked  to spray paint when I worked as a technician. That would allow me to get  some income until I will find a full time job in engineering. So please  if u are able to help me I would be very grateful.

And I promise that when I will get my first income from repairs I will donate the money to someone who also needs help.

,Needing help of any kind,"My lil family of 5 is down in the Burkburnett/WF area now and havent had the best of luck since our move. We are hours away from being homeless and I'm in search of resources to atleast get the lady and kiddos shelter.


The key points of our unfortunate circumstance:
-We have contacted Grace ministries and have plans to see them tomorrow.
-We have filed for housing and food assistance but it'll be sometime before that plays out.
-The local shelters have been full during our last few attempts to reach out. 
-We both are set for employment. Her on base and I at a call center. I'm also seeking a second PT job. 
-Problem is, I start on 7/15 and she hasnt received her start date yet. We both have upcoming interviews for backup options but tranportation between Burk and WF has been an issue. 
-We have an sub-par attic appartment we could get into but we need 700 to get in. 
-We have exhausted our funds to keep the kids fed and its also been put towards the residence we are currently having to leave. 
-We were under the impression that we were set on shelter but there are too many individuals in the household. We were advised to find other options before 4pm tomorrow. 
-We havent received mail here yet so proof of residence for the food pantry is unavailable.

We just need to make it to payday and we will be on our feet. Considering I start on the 15th, payday wont be until the 2nd of August. 

I can survive but I must find my family something til we get on our feet. I know theres alot of scammers out there so I understand exercising caution. We are willing to be interviewed or called concerning our issue. 

I'm willing to work for whatever it takes to keep my family safe. 

Thank you and best wishes.


Update: The stepmother and father to my fiance are the ones saying we can no longer stay. They changed the time to 8am for us to be out. They plan to take ""us"" to the homeless shelter. We suspect that they are now positioning the situation for them to take custody of the kids. 
They invited us down to help start a new life and it starting to seem like its might have been a set up. We believe that theyll attempt to only take my fiance and I to the shelter. 
This could derail all our progress and make it appear as though we had no means to stand on our own two feet.

Im lost

I need to figure a way to keep my family together and safe. Ive considered in the worst case scenario that if they are trying to take custody, that my fiance contacts the womens shelter for her and the kids. I need advice



Update 7/8
We are safe. We have joined forces with some amazing people. The kids are safe and we have found the resources we need to gain some stability until we start work. Thank you to those who read this and contributed.

,"Any help would be appreciated, thank you for reading","Hi 
I've never done this before so it's a bit weird. 
I'm a mum. And I need help. I don't know where else to turn. 
Basically I'll try to sum things up.
In November I fell ill with a very rare genetic condition that I've had from birth but has decided now it really wants to take charge of my life. Over the last 6 months my ability to walk has really been affected because my hips sublux (partially dislocate) and my muscle feel like I've run a marathon constantly along with a new heart condition, muscle weakness and spontaneous allergies. I now must use a walking stick and contemplating a wheelchair for some days. 
To go along with this my husband also has medical needs that are also getting worse.
In December the government decided that I was no longer disabled enough to receive the pip I had been receiving for 3 years previous. I'm sure many have seen in the news that the gov admitted to wrongly taking our benefits. 
Because my health has been declining my work has also been cut short it unliveable amount. I've been looking for work but unfortunately as much as the government like to pretend they don't actually care about getting the disabled into work. I'm trying for reception work. 
 I'm now struggling to pay rent. My boys birthdays are next month and I have to fork out for new school uniform for new school in September. All my benefits have been messing around because of mistakes they made about bedroom tax too. 
I'm really struggling physically and mentally here and I don't know what else to do. 
I'm unable to get any loans now because I have a bad credit score from when I was much younger. 
I don't know where to turn and really hoping someone can help me. 
I understand I might get troll and harassed but I'm really at the end of the road here. I just need to get back on my feet again so it's not so stressful..my head's a mess to be able to handle everything that's going on. 

If anyone can help even if a little bit I'd really appreciate it. I'm not expecting much but anything will help. 
My PayPal is ajudaplease1@gmail.com 
I'm not sure if it works like that ? If someone can correct me please too. 

Kind regards and again thank you for reading this"

,Seeking donations to correct injuries I sustained in a car wreck as a teen.,"When I was 15 I was involved in a car accident that was near fatal. I sustained many injuries including: nerve damage in left foot, broken femur, crushed pelvis, fractured spine, three broken ribs, punctured lung, broken collarbone, three breaks to my jaw, fractured eye socket, two bleeds on my brain, and a crushed nose. 
I spent two months in hospital recovering and 6 months as an outpatient. Eventually my bones and injuries healed but I was left with a face I do not recognize. Which has given me incredibly low self esteem and has had major negative effects on my mental health. I am seeking help for rhinoplasty. My nose was flattened. The doctors had to remove almost all of the bone and cartilage. This has caused me to have difficulties breathing normally as well. I have been battling my insurance company for over 10 years and I keep getting denied because they insist it is cosmetic. Any help even just $1 is immensely appreciated. I will try to add pictures to show how drastically my nose was damaged."

,Please help me with rent,"I posted this on r/donate and am going to copy/paste here. Any helps appreciated.

This is the first post I have ever made on Reddit, So I apologize in advance. There are some things I want to say.   My name is Adrian, And I'm 22 years old. I most likely have some form of EDS and am currently in the process of trying to get a diagnosis from a Geneticist, which will allow me to get on disability easily. My shoulders, fingers, and toes All dislocate very easily. Sometimes when I yawn my jaw almost dislocates.    About 7ish years ago I crippled myself by running about the distance of a city block a bit fast, And I have never walked the same after that, and my knees have never stopped hurting. A hell of a way for a former track runner to go I'd say.   In the last 2 years, I've been dealing with a lot, I don't want to get into all of it, But, In short: For all of 2017 I was very suicidal, and managed to pull myself through it somehow... And I am finally at a point where I am not too depressed to try and do things that I have needed to do for a long time. I recently found out that I've been in a dissociative episode for close to a decade, And that it is the cause of my rather serious memory issues that affect a lot of what I do.   There's a lot more to the story, But this is most of what I'm ok with saying.   I need about 700$ total to be able to stay in my apartment for the next month. I am desperate for money... I've been applying to jobs for the last 2 months. I can't stand up for long periods of time, and need a cane to even stand for more than a few minutes, So retail jobs are a little hard... Any lateral force can dislocate my shoulders, which just enforces that. Physically I can't do a lot of strenuous activities... It's very hard to find a job when your body is pretty much genetically predisposed to not be able to do anything correctly without a lot of extra work.   I don't even expect any help, I have long since forgotten how to accept help, and am only posting this because I am in a serious situation... And any help would be appreciated at this point. Even reading this is more help then I'd honestly expect...   I don't want to move back into my 1992 geo storm, ITs took me over 2 years to recover from living in it for 6 months, And I've finally reached a point in my life where I can actually do these things, And I can't let myself fall back into the old ways that almost ended it all for me.   I need help.

,please help with hospitalisation bills,"i am typing this whilst hospitalised and i don’t know what horrible amount it will be when i leave or when i get to leave. i was warded for clinical depression, which i have written posts if you have followed my username on reddit.
I don’t want to bore everyone with a story of how i got out of an abusive relationship, but all I can say is my mental health has paid the price over those 3 years and 1 year after breaking up, I’m still here.
I didn’t try to take my own life (though i’ve thought about it countless times) because I thought i had to be responsible for everyone else. but everyone cracks. and i guess the surmounting bills that i’ve paid for my medications using my credit card and now this hospitalisation has reached the point where i can no longer cope. I had savings. I was working, I had a healthy amount of savings which over the past year just ran dry. i don’t know what to do once i get unhospitalised. hopefully my landlady will be nice enough to let me go for at least a month.
i’ve been here for 1.5 weeks now, and I have effectively been out of work for more than 1 year. I’ve exhausted more than 90% of my savings just on rent and I don’t know what else I can do. All I’m asking for anyone and everyone is to help me with a dollar. Just $1. I’ll be very grateful for it, and if I can I will thank you personally, and if I can’t I will do so virtually. if you want to help me out more, i don’t even know how to respond at this point.
and if you cannot afford $1 because I really know what that is like, I hope you can share this with someone, and that someone can pass this on. Every dollar will mean so much to me. i didn’t make a go fund me because i know there are people out there who are much worst off. but i didn’t know where else to turn.

,Donation for School Supplies,"Hi guys, 

&#x200B;

I am a 28 year old, (going into my) 4th year of teaching, high school teacher  in south Atlanta. I teach at a Title-1 high school. 100% of the students there are from economically disadvantaged families. Our county is also one of the largest school systems in the state (5th) and one of the top 100 largest school districts in the country.  Our overall rating is a D- which is pretty bad. However, my high school has worked hard to make a name and reach a B rating. We are ranked 21st in Georgia and 552 in the U.S.  I am super proud of our kids and I want them to help them go as far as they can in life.  

&#x200B;

Something that isn't always highlighted is how much teachers spend on their students. Too much for me to want to think about that number. I'm teaching Forensic Science for the first time at my school and we don't have materials for it. If anybody would like to throw a few dollars towards our supplies, both myself and the kids would appreciate it so much. 

&#x200B;

As a side note, if anyone is worried the money might be coming towards me - all materials have to stay with the school, even if I leave. So it will always only go towards the kids, for their benefit.

The best, cheapest (and most appropriate) camera for weddings I've found is a full-frame mirrorless. Of that category, the cheapest that would deliver sellable results is the Sony a7 Mark III.

If someone could help me get money for this camera that would be awesome. It would be awesome if someone could just donate an a7 III that they no longer want to use.

I know this sounds like a handout. It's more like, give someone something, and he will try his best to raise income with said donated item.

Questions and comments are always welcome. Thanks so much"

We have a family friend who’s 6 year old girl passed away today. She had medical complications since she was 2, and wasn’t expected to live a year after that. She made it to six. This weekend she took a turn for the worse and she passed away today.

They’re hard working folks, who’s lives started to turn around last year, with better jobs, and icing situation. Overall slightly happier and more comfortable, and then this. They don’t know I’m posting this, I’m not even sure if they know what reddit is, but I’m going to post their gofundme below.

,Emotional Support in Japan,"Hi guys. I come here out of pure desperation and tears in my eyes. My need might not be as big as others but this is so important to me. I have the absolute honor and privilege of being able to move to Japan in October (hopefully permanently) for a language school then to finish my bachelors degree. I am only really able to do this because of money set aside by my late grand parents for my education and the money they left us when they passed, which I am so grateful for. But I ran into a huge roadblock today.

Backstory:

I grew up in a suburb in California with two therapists as therapists. However I was constantly bullied and left by ""friends"" all throughout elementary and middle school which left me very scarred. I learned in about 6th or 7th grade that this was probably due to the fact that I suffer with severe Attention Deficit Disorder (Not ADHD I'm not hyperactive). Due to the bullying and other things that had happened I was later diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I really struggled with coping almost my whole life. Despite the fact that my parents are therapists, they didn't seem to understand what I was going through.

I have two cats who I rescued as kittens. I have always loved cats but have always been allergic. When I got the opportunity to rescue two Russian Blues, I jumped at the chance and they're everything I could have ever wanted. They got me through the death of my grandmother and a the painful separation of my former best friend and I and I registered them as emotional support animals (which is a title they have greatly earned). No one in my life has been a constant like them.  When I got the opportunity to go to Japan, I was so excited to start this adventure with since I didn't plan on ever leaving Japan (still don't), that I instantly started the process to get them ready to fly. I consulted multiple vets and their foster mom to make sure I had done everything I needed to make sure everything was smooth and stress free. Their foster mom recommended a company to use to transport the cats and they've been great so far.

&#x200B;

Except for the quote.

&#x200B;

$2,985 USD

&#x200B;

This quote doesn't include their second rabies shot and titer test for both cats which is around $600 USD

I also don't know if the quarantine in Japan will cost anything and i have to buy crates and supplies for them.

So now were at $3,500 USD.

I can't afford this.

I'm already working as much as I physically can as an Uber driver (Ill have to give a lot of my money back in taxes). I'm going to be embarrassing myself at a restaurant singing to make some tips. And I have over a $1,000 USD in debt to pay off before I can even THINK about saving.

But I have to take my cats with me. The first time I went to Japan I was there for 6 weeks and I had such bad homesickness that I was sobbing for about an hour in the shower and cried myself to sleep. And I was with a friend and her family, I was never alone.

This time around I will be alone. I don't want to imagine how hard that's going to be.

I don't like asking for help like this. I don't like taking other peoples hard earned money. But I don't know what else to do or who to turn to. My extended family wont help. I don't have many friends. You don't even have to give money. ANYTHING that would help I would take. I genuinely hope I'm overlooking an option and I don't even need anyone's money.

If you want to help but don't want to just give a random person money I TOTALLY understand. I'm an artist and I also do commissions. DM me and we can arrange for that as well. I do mostly character designs. I'll leave some examples of my work below.

&#x200B;

,Me and my girlfriend just lost everything in a house fire.,"Me and my girlfriend have been living on our own for the past 2 years. Tuesday was our one year anniversary so we decided to go to bush gardens. 30 minutes after we enter the park we get a call from our property manger saying there’s flames spitting out of our windows. We drive an hour back home to see fire trucks and cop cars lined up the street. Everything in our house was reduced to ash, even our cat. When redcross finally got on scene they gave us $300 and sent us on our way. We haven’t heard from them since then. That night, at 3 am while my girlfriend was sleeping in our car and I was staying awake to make sure no one tried to break in I decided to make a gofundme. Within the first day we raised over $400. This was fantastic. However the next day abc7 news put out an article saying the house was “vacant at the time.” People are misinterpreting that as no one lived in the house. Now we are getting death threats all over facebook(our main source of sharing the gofundme) we’re being called frauds, vulgar insults and even being blocked from posting in the local groups. We both work, my girlfriend is actually at work right now pulling a double shift. We just don’t know what to do. We’re being oppressed and insulted for asking for help. We’ve already reached out to all of the local organizations and churches but we’re not married and don’t have children so their not to keen on helping us.

I'm asking for help with food, bus fare, cat food and litter. I do not have transportation to get to the food pantry in my city nor am I able to get to the SPCA or local humane society to get free cat food. I've gone through ALL of the available resources and they are not able to help me. I'm hopeful of gettingv approved for STD when l was unable to work, but we still need help until I get a full check from work. No amount is too small and greatly appreciated. Thank you."
,Any Help At All,"First of all it kills me to ask this of anyone, I have always had pride in being able to provide. I recently got laid off after we lost a very large contract.

That's students as young as 11 to teachers well into their elder years. This has been a tradition since the schools foundation in 1893. We do this to help charities and to upgrade our quite frankly out dated school. In the past, the money raised has helped to fix broken appliances, classroom equipment and walls/floors/ceilings. This has made the school feel safer to be in. The walk has also allowed us to make a new sports centre, for our at the time, inadequate facilities. We updated sports equipment, changing rooms and a sports hall. Most recently, we built a parade square for our cadet force. But this was all for us, what about for others? We have donated a huge amount of money to cancer research UK, RNLI, UNICEF, Khalsa aid, Porchlight and many many more. We appreciate any kind of donation. Please help these charities and our school.

,Pre-Fab bomb shelters for South of Israel citizens.,"Not sure if this is the place to ask this, if not, please direct me to the right place, thanks!  


I'm a citizen of Israel, though not under rocket attack (yet).  
I keep hearing of injuries or deaths on the radio/news and thought of all the companies, in the US and around the world, who produce bomb shelters.  


Tried emailing some I found on Google, no reply (for obvious reasons...).  
Any idea how can I locate any such companies and see if there's an interest in donating or selling at cost or below, ship to Israel  for Goof Will, Charity and, for their benefit, free advertisement?"
,I’ve never asked for outside help like this.... but I don’t know where else to turn—,"I’ve never ever asked for donations or anything like this before, but I have gotten myself/my family into a bit of a bind. I currently have health insurance through the marketplace and it’s an absolute necessity as I have 2 children, one of which takes medication for ADHD and I suffer from chronic pain associated with scoliosis (my spine is crooked AND twisted) and I’m diagnosed with Neuropathy, Neuralgia, Restless Leg Syndrome, etc. so my oldest son and I take medication regularly that we simply cannot afford to pay for without insurance. I (thought) I had set up automatic monthly payments through the Cigna website in January, but I just learned that I only setup a 1 time payment, therefore, no premium payments have been paid since February. I currently owe a little over $600 and I have to have it paid in full to reactivate my benefits. I only need about $200 to have enough to pay the past due balance, but I just don’t know where to turn to obtain it. We had a few hundred in our savings that I drew out and paid thinking that it would be enough to resume my benefits, but I just spoke to Cigna Billing and Enrollment, and I have to pay the entire balance at this point. If anyone could possibly help me out in any way, it would be so appreciated and I would even be willing to pay it back within the next few months once I get straightened out again. I’m so incredibly ashamed to have to ask for something like this, but I do not receive any kind of benefits through the govt, no food stamps, no welfare, nothing. My husband and I work every day and pay our taxes and try to be good, decent people, but sometimes things happen and since this affects my family so deeply, I feel like I have to step up and ask for help this time. 
Thank you so much. I’m not sure how this all works, but I guess if you’re able to help in any way, let me know and we can go from there...? Like I said, I’ve never asked for anything like this before so I have no clue how it works.
Edit: I can crochet and craft pretty well, so I would be willing to do projects for anyone who could donate.. I also do some modeling on the side, more of a hobby (NOT nude or risqué, just fashion, I’ve done some horror-type stuff, anything artsy and creative I love.

We just need enough money to get back to the USA so we can stay with family until we regain our footing. We have a one-year-old and another baby on the way due in June. We desperately need help. Any assistance would be the difference between us having a home or being on the street. And being on the street in Mexico is not the same as being homeless in America. I don't really know how this works but I'm going to include my cash app name. Even if some of you don't have cash app just put in my code and it'll give us both a free $5 thank you again I'm trying to stay hopeful.

,Help for my only family left with me.,"I've gone through hell this last month since I have not received my pay fully yet and I've reported it already since I am in dire need of it, but even my government is so corrupt, no one will move to help my case and I know other people are experiencing the same. I can't find another job because I have to come to my [Grandfather](https://gogetfunding.com/aortic-aneurysm-help/) and he's the only one I have left who still thinks highly of me. Who didn't let me give up my dream while everyone else told us that my dream was worthless.

I should have listened. I became a graphic artist and yet jobs I get aren't enough to sustain us. I've lost so much already and I have less than $30 to my name, and my job won't pay me in full of my back pay of $150 and that they still owe me at least $250 and that they'd only release cash-advances worth $10 to $15 a week.

I've asked ""true"" friends that I only have but of course none of them could lend me the money I needed.

I've had at least 5 mental breakdowns already, and counting, and I even had to go to my Alma matter's school to talk with a guidance counsellor for free, but she was new and I couldn't find my old guidance counsellor. I cried so hard when someone took their time to give us at least something for a night's stay.

I'm just so angry with myself I could have just let go of my dream and end up earning more incase this happens. I couldve just let go of what I wanted to do in life than let him suffer our demise. I could have done so much but no. I became selfish and didn't bother thinking that my skillset is not enough. Now I work as a crew in Mcdonalds, a graphic artist for a tarpaulin company that won't pay me properly and a resort janitress."

,"Medical bills piled up faster than I could ever imagine, insurance is horrible.","I'm 20, in college, and honestly very stuck. 

  
Information: Went to the doctor for a simple check up on my leg. It hurt like hell for a while and I would wake up sometimes crying. It was painful, but manageable. I go to my doctor expecting perhaps a muscle relaxer or just a ""Hey, nothing's wrong, good luck out there and get more of this vitamin to help."" She looks at my leg and orders an ultrasound of my vein at a private hospital in my town. Tells me it's a possibility I have a DVT, or deep vein thrombosis. Lucky me, apparently that can be deadly so she wants it checked immediately. I go there, get it checked, and there's nothing. I'm happy for sure, but the only thing running through my head is ""Oh god, this is going to be so much money."" 

And it was. About $270. Nothing close to the deductible I need to reach so insurance helped me not get charged $700 so it's just the $270. Sweet, but... now that doesn't sound like much and I know it isn't compared to other people's bills, but I make about $280 a paycheck (I work part time, $7.25 an hour, and i'm lucky to reach even 20 hours a week and get paid biweekly) and I owe my school a monthly bill of $350. Add that to the bills I already owe that i'm paying off myself, I'm lucky to have $40 at the end of those two weeks. Food is fine situation wise and everything else, my university is helpful in those areas. I just really, really need help with this bill. I'm so scared of going to collections. I cannot let my credit take such a blow. It'd be devastating.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Charity/comments/bd2w86/request_new_computer_for_my_friend_canada/

So one of my friends who's on reddit (trying to keep this on the downlow) has been surviving with a 10 year old laptop that can't even run minecraft.

I live in the states, but he lives in Canada. This is the kind of person that just rolls with everything with a smile. He doesn't even use bad language, he's just happy to exist and be your friend. He's helped me out through some very tough times, dealing with PTSD and suicide attempts and all of that, so I myself am in some debt (partially cuz I keep giving away all my money), otherwise I would buy him one myself and have it mailed to him like I have for others in the past.

He's saved up a few hundred dollars, and he's looking at an $800 budget desktop build, but honestly I think he deserves more, or at least a budget desktop as a gift for being such a damn good person. I have his address, I've sent him pizza before, so instead of taking random people's money I was just hoping to organize and send him all the parts he needs."
,"Columbus to Los Angeles, wife has PTSD and 3 year old toddler","We're  trying to raise money to pay for travel expenses and a deposit for an  apartment.er. We have a three year old boy. My wife  takes care of the  boy and due to an abusive upbringing, can't really work.  
Our  neighborhood is getting gentrified (people are buying all the  surrounding property, hiking the rent) and my wife doesn't want to live  in Ohio because if reminds her of her abusive childhood. She moved out when she her late teens but she lost her job and she had to move back in with her abusers or be homeless, which reversed any healing that she managed.   


She moved in with me while I was attending Art School in Columbus, Ohio. In my senior year she began to manifest signs of PTSD. I love my wife but handling our financial expenses has been difficult, and it got so much more when we had  a child. Post-partum depression in already difficult to manage, but in an abuse victim, it's absolutely terrifying.  


 I had to quickly find a job that paid enough to support a child, so now I work in a call center, have been for 2 and half years. I always pay our rent, all our bills are paid on time. I've had to manage alot.

I have had to go to therapy just to cope with caring for a child and and my wife because I was terrified of my son's last memory of me would be finding me dead in the bathroom, but now I'm in a healthier state of mind to care for them.  


We can't stay here anymore.

I have an art degree. I know Illustration, Graphic Design, Animation and writing. I have contacts in LA- good friends.  
My wife and I come from a long lineage of Mid-Western folks who worked themselves to death in a place they didn't like.  
We're  trying to save up money, but it's difficult. We're moving to Los  Angeles, even if it means we could end up homeless.  Even if it meant  losing everything.

We're getting rid of my wifes cat, whom she's had for 9 years, whom she used as support when she began to live with her abusers again; you can't find affordable housing that allows pets. This will absolutely crush her but she's willing to do that in the name of a better life for our son, Kensington.  


We have a GoFundMe but I don't have alot of friends with money either.

,Dog needs a vet.,"Hey guys. I really really don’t like asking people for this, but my family really needs money right now to take my dog to a vet. We need around 200-300 dollars to get blood tests and all of that, of which we do not have. He was completely fine 2 days ago, but suddenly started vomiting and now has trouble moving. He refuses food altogether, which is abnormal of him, seeing as he was prancing around on Monday and trying to steal our dinner. We think he may have been bitten by a brown recluse or even a black widow, which run rampant here in the Arizonan desert (southern). It’s very possible, and he’s shown the same symptoms as my Aunt’s dog, who was also bitten by a brown recluse (vomiting, fever, trouble moving, refusal to eat). It could be fatal.

The symptoms were sudden, leading us to believe this. We barely have enough to eat daily, so of course we wouldn’t have enough to take him to a vet. So I come here now asking if anybody could please donate. It would help us out so much. Even if you can’t, just spreading the word and even some support would help in this situation. If you can donate anything at all, please do so at my PayPal link. The only method I’ll be able to accept money by is PayPal.

,"My cat has a bladder stone, needs surgery, and is now peeing blood again; I can't pay for it and she is everything to me","I've been quoted $1900-2000 for the stone removal surgery to prevent this from getting even worse. this includes tests to make sure the issue is completely taken care of, such as another set of xrays to make sure they didn't miss any additional stones, the largest of which is over 1cm, testing of the bladder wall to make sure they aren't missing a deeper infection, testing the stone at a lab to see what type it is and thus how to prevent more, etc. Because it isn't ""emergently"" life threatening (yet), I don't qualify for the hope fund, and probably won't qualify until she is much sicker and the cost is much steeper, and the fund still wouldn't even cover all of it, and the remaining payment would still be required up front. nobody in my family is willing to help with the cost. I am disabled, cannot work in any capacity, have been fighting for disability income for six years now, and have no resources whatsoever. I am trying to sell the few things I own that I can spare that are worth anything but if they even sell, they will only total maybe $200, and the family member I live with has already announced that I will be giving them that money. with the situation i'm in, if i refuse this demand, i get kicked out. it goes without saying that i cannot keep or continue to even try and help any of my animals if i have to give them up and go be homeless again.

the why this matters so much: I have been suicidal for twelve to fourteen years-- it's hard to tell exactly when it really started in seriousness, but somewhere thereabouts. All that has ever mattered to me are cats, I grew up with them, I have always related to them and been extremely strongly bonded to them, even ones that ""don't like people,"" and my ex and I got three of our own wonderful, wonderful cats over the years we were together, each one as young kittens. My ex left me with all of our animals this autumn and, despite having known about our oldest cat's condition for years, has always remained unwilling to do anything about it either. the one who is sick was our first. she is my first cat that i ever had that was MINE, and not my family's or just one i temporarily lived with. she has kitty-anxiety, i adopted her as a rescue who was abandoned by someone who had no idea how to handle her and she is extremely bonded to me and seeks me for comfort when things scare her. she is my first baby and she means so, so much to me, and having to clean up her bloody pee off the floor and try and comfort her and flood her with as much love as much as i possibly can when i know she must be in so much pain and I can't do anything about it at all, and having everyone around me tell me over and over to just give up on her and put her down like shes just some dirty, problematic wild animal that nobody cares about, is just too much. im afraid if i just give her up to a shelter she'll either be judged as too much of a cost to help and just be put down, or adopted out to someone who ends up doing the same. i cannot ever choose to abandon her, no matter what happens, but i cannot help her on my own.

i can't expect much of a response to this but please, if someone happens to be on this board with enough money to throw around to help save a wonderful, innocent, beautiful, scared animal in pain who means literally my entire life to me, there would not be words that exist in any language for my gratitude.

,Help pay for my grandmother's cancer operation,"My name is Guillermo Gonzalez, and I am a Venezuelan currently attempting to survive inside my country as it struggles with economic and political turmoil. This post is done to talk about the situation of my grandmother, Olga Martínez (née Valderrama), 67. On December 2018, she was diagnosed with an earlier stage of breast cancer.

Those who have read information about Latin America are most likely aware of the grueling situation which currently enwraps Venezuela. I will not derail the purpose of this post with extensive information about this as anyone reading this can easily google the information by themselves, but I am confirm that it is every bit as bad as most of the mainstream media informs - While some sectors of the country have managed to remain moderately stable, the majority of the country has been plunged into a state of hyperinflation and scarcity which has affected the lives of the average Venezuelan on all levels, myself included. Years ago, paying off an operation of this type in order would've been relatively easy, specially given the social welfare programs put in place - Over the last few years, this is no longer the case, and on the rare ocassions where there's funds, a lack of medicine halts progress. Luckily, for us, we live in an area somewhat close to the border with Colombia where we took my grandmother to schedule an operation which will, hopefully, rid her of the cancer completely as it still in a relatively early stage. However, the biggest issue is the lack of funds - While most of the family has been able to provide a grain of sand, most of us have a monthly wage which translates into little more than $500 combined between my parents, uncles and myself. These measley wages have been enough to survive (though not live), but it won't be enough to cover for all the expenses involved with the operation my grandmother needs - including payment for travel and lodging.

We are just short of a couple hundred dollars in order to be relatively safe in all departments. That is why the funding I ask is relatively small - I ask for only 250 dollars, no more. If you are able to help, please consider donating. If you are incapable of putting in yourself, sharing this around with somebody who might is hugely helpful. Please, help my grandmother have the operation she requires in order to continue living - My grandmother is one of the most important people in my life, and I cannot see myself without her at my side. Pictures of her will be shared if requested, and I can also share pictures of myself, alone and with her, if you need convincing.

I cannot create a gofundme, justgiving etc campaign as all of them require me to a citizen from the US/EU/etc. Therefore, the only way I have in order to receive funds is my paypal account. I know some people are really sketchy with that stuff which leads to people being doubtful about it, but it's really all I got. If you feel like you can trust it, my paypal direction is herestolife821@gmail.com - Thank you so much for reading this."

,Animal Rescue Running Low in Funds!,"Hi Redditors! 

I’m Beckie and I own/run a animal rescue centre in the North East of the UK. 

I house injured wildlife such as Hedgehogs, Owls, Foxes, Badgers and sometimes hawks. 
But an extension of this is a hand rearing service for orphaned kittens and puppies.  Many of these babies have been dumped on the doorstep because there has been something wrong with them. Just like the wildlife we nurse them to health and release or Rehome. 

Last year I was quite poorly so I didn’t have the normal time I would have to fund raise for this year as we are run purely on donations. I’m in the process of gaining charity status. 

I have been fund raising to keep us open until Autumn for all the orphaned Hedgehogs, bats and Squirrels that will inevitably come through our doors. As we use heat pads and incubators the cost of electric is through the roof, supplies are bought at wholesale buy are expensive and everyone that works here, works completely free. 

We have just about gotten enough to keep us open to winter 2019 but we had an emergency last night. Two, 7 day old bulldogs were dumped on our doorstep it 3:30am. The smelt of bleach, screaming in pain, vomiting and foaming from the nose. We rushed them to the vet and the poor buggers had bleach poured down their throats. The suffered burns in their mouths, nasal passages, throat and stomach and are now in intensive care in the vets. 

If there is even 1% chance an animal can live a happy comfortable life, we will do everything in our power to save a baby. 

The bulldogs will be coming back into my care in the next 72 hours and will need round the clock care and tube feeds. They need specialist food that will help heal their stomach while being gentle enough not to upset it. 

So the money we have raised to stay open in the Autumn is being spent on these babies. 

We are currently setting up an official charity page. But until then we have a PayPal for one off donations. Donations can be any size from €\$\£1 to what ever you can afford. We also have Patreon for monthly donations and you get loads of cute extras. Check out the links below.

On Friday March 15th, my great-grandparents home caught fire. They lost everything. 

Friday the 15th was also my great-grandfathers 91st birthday. 

He and his brothers built the house from the ground up. He and my great-grandmother (89 y/o) raised 7 kids in this house. My great-grandparents are stubborn people. They like to do everything on their own. However, they are getting older and need help, especially in this time of need. 

Unfortunately, the house was not insured. We have raised enough through friends and family for the demolition but are continuing to raise money in efforts to get/build them a new home.

Unfortunately, I am a military kid, and have moved away. It's been really tough on the both of us. Natalie has really severe anxiety, and it makes it really hard for her to socialize. Our little group is all we have. A lot of things have been going downhill for her and it's really affected her mental health and overall happiness.

There is one ray of light we've both been clinging to: thanks to my grandma, on June 15th, we get to see the national tour of Wicked together! She's always been the Galinda to my Elphaba, and this show means a lot to us. After that night, I probably won't see her for another few years. I need money for 2 things: to buy her the matching half to our friendship necklaces (someone porch-pirated from my it and its sitting in a pawn shop downtown. never even got to give it to her), and buy her some merch from the show.  She's never seen a Broadway show before, so I want it to be really special, and I want her to have something to remind her she isn't alone, of how much I love her, and to make her smile. I know it isn't as major as some of the other requests on here, but Natalie means the world and more to me and her happiness means everything to me.

And before you ask- yes, I work, but audition season has been really slow for me (the flu has kicked my ass and cost me countless jobs), and expenses and school has been closing in on me. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm begging :(

,I need help to support my life?,"I never thought I'll post here...I actually hated this sub cause of all the self-entitled people who requested to buy this/that, fund for trip etc. Never thought that I'll actually come here for help...

&#x200B;

I reside in Malaysia with a stable job, mid level income I would say (Rm5k before tax)? I have bought a house two years ago and previously saved enough to make full payment on a local car. I have no trouble paying for the house on my own + savings, so while I don't live a lavish lifestyle, I live rather comfortably, having saving more than a quarter of my earning every month.

&#x200B;

Until my mom got breast cancer. She's currently undergoing chemotheraphy, which cost Rm8000 per cycle. We've gotten help from National Cancer Society of Malaysia, so they are helping to cover 50% of the chemo price per cycle. She has gone through 8 rounds of chemo, there are 16 more rounds coming up and then followed up by radiotheraphy (number of rounds to be confirmed after finishing chemo). She has also gone through a surgery to remove lymph nodes from under her arm, and also her left breast.

&#x200B;

I have quite a pitiful amount of savings from before to cover all the first few rounds of chemo, (chemo is once every two to three weeks). But my savings are sufficient for another round next week only. I'm putting up my condo up for sale at a loss price, but with the current market situation, it will be very hard to get a buyer unless I lower the price further. I've considered selling my car to cover the cost too, but my work requires car to travel too, so I'm currently looking for another nearer job before selling off my car to raise more money. I have a brother who is spending a majority of his earning on the condo that he and my parents are staying, and we are looking to sell it off as well, but that'll need time too. To reduce the cost, we've taken leave to help my mom out so that she isn't required to stay in the hospital + travel cost, that saves a lot too.

&#x200B;

We are also looking for more charity within Malaysia that helps to cover for cancer, hoping we will get one within time. Unfortunately she was uneducated and with little earnings when we are small, they didnt buy insurance for themselves.

&#x200B;

I don't need a lot of money, this being Malaysia, even USD1 will help a lot thanks to currency conversion. I can cover the cost of theraphy and some other expenses myself for now, but with less than rm200 to survive on each month, I needed help to cover our food and travel expenses...

Edit: After doing another round of calculation, I can only cover our basic cost of living + other expenses. So I won't be able to save enough to cover the therapy cost. If there's any donation, it will purely for the theraphy and none will be used for any other expenses, not even for hospital stay cost.

,Running the Boston Marathon for Eye Research,"In 2013, I graduated from undergrad with the dream of becoming the worlds next Steven Spielberg. And for a few months, everything was on track, I got into Boston University's Master's of Fine Arts film program (one of the top 25 film schools in the country), and for a brief moment, the possibilities for my future were endless. I'm an avid snowboarder and at the start of the ski season, I started to see a weird oil-like blob in my left eye, along with some floating black shadows. For a while, I thought it was a problem with the ski goggles because I only noticed the problem against the contrast of the bright, white snow. But a hard fall one afternoon proved me wrong. In the blink of an eye, a large snowflake-like shadow was cast across a large section of my left eye and I could barely see out of it.

An emergency appointment with a local ophthalmologist told me I had uveitis, but they didn't explain anything and, honestly, left me more scared than anything else. Uveitis is an autoimmune disease. My body somehow decided that my eye was a foreign object and started to attack it. If I didn't do something quickly, I was going to go blind.

The first time I stepped into Mass Eye and Ear, I didn’t know what to expect, but I soon realized I was the youngest person there. As I reflect back, that moment was the worst part of my journey. Not only was my dream of becoming a filmmaker slowly slipping away, there was no one my age that I could relate to. Everyone in the waiting room was significantly older. I was alone. And on top of that, I was scared to talk to anyone about my condition. I was scared Boston University would kick me out of their MFA program because I couldn't fully see out of my left eye. I thought they would see me as a failure because I saw myself as a failure. Everywhere I looked I was reminded that my dreams where destroyed. Doctors couldn’t figure out where my uveitis had come from and none of the medication was working. I had lost all hope. I wanted nothing more than to give up, stay in bed, and let my disease define me.

But the doctors at Mass Eye and Ear never gave up and eventually I started to believe that there was hope. I spent 5 years fighting this disease, both physically and mentally. It's been a long journey, and I found out last month that I'm nearing the end of this journey. My autoimmune disease is under control and almost cleared up. And I decided that this was the perfect time to give back to my amazing team of doctors at Mass Eye and Ear and help fund more research for uveitis and hopefully find a cure.

,"Looking for Donations to assist Victims of Domestic Violence * Our organization has obtained 501(c)(3) non-profit status, which means that donations are fully tax-deductible","Dear Friend and Supporter, 


As someone who is in a leadership position at Your Company, I know that you’re pressed for time. But please, could you give me your full attention for the next 30 seconds as you read this letter?
You see, Domestic Violence has become a huge concern that many people are aware of but do not understand how extremely dangerous and hard it is for a victim to get out. The chance of a victim successfully leaving his or her abuser is extremely low. The total of domestic Violence homicides, about 75%of the victims were killed as they attempted to leave the relationship or after the relationship had ended. People ask why the victim doesn’t just leave, do they like the abuse and the answer to that is, No one wants to be hurt, beaten or made to feel inferior. People stay in abusive relationships for several reasons. They may have nowhere to go. They may believe that it is better for their children to stay in a stable home. For many women, the reason they stay is because of fear. The fact that people experience domestic violence doesn’t make them inherently “weak.” Through manipulation and coercion abusers often chip away at the victim’s self-esteem. Sometimes this process happens so subtly that the victim is unaware of the psychological, emotional and other types of abuse that often precede a physically violent attack. In addition, it is important to note that many victims grew up in homes where there was excessive violence and turbulence. They may have seen their parents abuse alcohol and drugs, and consequently blamed themselves for the dysfunction and unhappiness

A new study ranked Nevada as the second-worst state for domestic violence. Metro Reported that the murders police investigate in Southern Nevada, one-fourth are related to domestic violence. The concern is that in Southern Nevada there is one organization dedicated to assisting Victims. Many Victims stay home and continue the cycle of abuse or do not report the crime because there is nowhere to go, the chance of leaving home in the middle of the night with your children and calling a shelter or crisis line and getting immediate help is very slim. For these very reasons The Dock Ellis Foundation, Inc launched a 24 hour, 7 days a week 800 crisis line. When the victim calls into the hotline, we provide instant outreach services. The victims are assigned an advocate and provided a safe location to stay immediately. This can be a hotel, motel or shelter. Many time community shelters are not an option due to bed availability or the victim decided to leave their abuser to late at night. Doors open to many shelters between the hours of 3:30 PM and 5:30 PM any time after that the victim is left wondering: What is next”



With the many obstacles combined, lack of immediate safety, financial concerns and lack of immediate resources due to most of these organizations are Monday- Friday 9AM-5PM, makes it impossible for the victim to feel confident in JUST leaving. Unless someone steps in to help them. And that’s where you come in. The focus for The Dock Ellis Foundation, Inc is to fill in the gaps and build community partnerships. Again, we are available to victims 365 days, 24 hours, 7days a week to provide transportation, community outreach, court assistance, safe housing, emergency clothing, food and lifelong Advocacy to the victim. We want the victim to know that no matter the time when THEY are ready, we are here!


By donating and helping The Dock Ellis Foundation, Inc to be able to have the available funds needed to continue providing the assistance to the victims, you are not just helping them, but you’re also investing in the long-term future health of your community. You will be planting seeds of HOPE. Not only that, by contributing you will also be receiving free advertising and positive public relations in the community and other States suffering with the same concerns. That’s because we will post your name in the program for The Dock Ellis Foundation, Inc Major Fundraiser Honoring the Late Legendary Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Dock Ellis, coming up on June 12th, 2019 in Pittsburgh, the weekend anniversary to when Dock Ellis pitched a No Hitter for the Pirates in 1970. This event is being sponsored by the ACE Hotel where many major Sponsors will be in attendance, as well as on any materials produced promoting the event. To top it all off, we will have a “Partner Wall,” bearing the names of all the contributors on display, which will be prominently displayed at the fundraiser. Finally we want to show our support for a lifetime but offering lifetime recognition on our website.

,Help my mother and I buy a trailer and fund my transition,"Hello!
I am Isabella and I'm here to request donations to fund two things.
The first is that I would like to raise even just part of the money to buy a trailer for my mother and I.
The second is to fund the costs of transitioning from male to female that are not covered by insurance (cosmetic surgery, legal fees, unexpected medical costs).

Now for a little about us.
My mother is a hard working and kind hearted woman who's generosity knows no bounds. After working 6 days a week over a hot grill she comes home to our shared appartment with 2 roommates. Her first concern is replacing any house hold necessities without worry of being repaid for it. She then moves on to checking on all the young adults she claimed as her children during my childhood friendships making sure they are happy, fed, and have a place to eat. From their she moves on to her dog whom she will spare no expense to make sure he's happy.
She has been nothing but supportive in my transition giving everything she can.

As I write this I am 24 years old, preparing to speak with my doctor about hormones at my next appointment, and have some interesting plans for my transition goals. I suffered a severe depressive episode earlier this year after the lose of a family member, my job, and mine and my mother's previous appartment. This episode resulted in a week stay in a psychiatric facility to stabilize and medicate me. Although I am doing my best to get back on my feet looking for a job and selling art its a slow and rough journey.
Ideally I would like to be working and attending school while transitioning next year but I do not want to push my self.

If you are interested in donating I have both the cash app and PayPal.

I hope to hear from some generous souls very soon!"

My goal is to get 1 million pencils/extra credit points to see what this does for his grade.

,I am raising money to help a child stay warm and fed this winter,"I am raising funds for Mahjabeen (age 25) and her little girl Farzana (age 7). I met Mahjabeen 15 years ago in Afghanistan when she knocked at our door asking for a job to help around the house. My mother said to her “You are only 10 years” old to which she replied ‘Please ma’am, I don’t want to beg, I can help with any chores around the house, you can pay me whatever you want or just give me food”. That’s how I came to know this strong woman. She helped my mother for 7 years until she was married. 

Mahjabeen married a soldier at the age of 17 and gave birth a beautiful little girl a year later. She told me her husband treated her well and that she was happy. *Sadly, her happiness was short-lived. After four years of marriage, her husband was killed by Taliban attack one dark night when he was standing guard at the military post. She was left alone, with a 3-year-old daughter to care for and no place to live.* She came back to my mother for support and she is currently working for her to support not only her daughter Farzana but her ill mother as well. Her income is not enough to make ends meet. 

Please donate to this family. Farzana is in school this year, let’s lend a hand to buy her clothes, shoes, school supplies and money for transport so she doesn’t have to walk an hour to school every day. I want to enroll her in English classes and invest in her education, so she can grow up to be a bright young lady and possibly a better future. Also, we can help this mother and daughter keep warm and fed this harsh winter.

,"Insurance refuses to cover $35,500 in medically necessary surgical costs for lipedema, and I'm on unpaid medical leave. (Even if you can't donate, please read to learn more about this disorder and what I'm doing to change the medical/insurance industry!)","[https://www.gofundme.com/f/gabis-medical-hiatus](https://www.gofundme.com/f/gabis-medical-hiatus)

# Short version:

All of my weird lifelong symptoms heightened and crashed together over the last three years (following a major death in my life and moving to Atlanta) resulting in medical leave from work starting June 2019 which used to be paid but is now $0 while dealing with appeals (though only 70% if it's approved.)

I don't anticipate being able to return to work until April or May depending on recovery from removing lipedema. Insurance is not covering the very medically necessary surgeries, totaling **$35,500**. I also have recurring fees for supplements recommended by my doctors (and some out of network doc visits) that legitimately make a difference in my health. (I've tried not taking them for a while to see what happens and my body just starts malfunctioning even more.)

My other conditions include lymphedema, dysautonomia, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hypermobile-EDS), Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), sleep apnea, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. While the last three are mental, they exacerbate the physical disorders. I believe these disorders are in my genetics due to ancestral trauma and my own.

&#x200B;

Edit: Proof of charges: [https://imgur.com/a/vsdFpTJ](https://imgur.com/a/vsdFpTJ)

Edit 2: these are credit card charges. I am essentially doing all I can to move these around to low or no interest cards but I couldn't pay them off within 15mo even if I had my full income. Doctors request money up front for these procedures because they are almost never covered by insurance. They do not usually go through hospital systems either.

# Details:

My biggest medical expenses are 3-4\* surgeries for lipedema which are not covered by insurance because the insurance codes for the disorder won't be implemented in the US until at least 2021 but likely 2025.

[About Lipedema - aka Painful Fat Syndrome (Lipedema Project)](https://lipedemaproject.org/about-lipedema/)

**Lipedema is a painful fat disorder that essentially sends lipedema fat (different in cell structure, physical appearance, cause, and behavior than diet/lifestyle or 'normal' fat) through the lymphatic system to the limbs (typically starting with the lower legs going up.) The areas are usually painful to the touch in varying degrees and can become debilitating as it progresses the disease to obesity.**

**Lipedema fat CANNOT be lost through diet or exercise. Lipedema fat strangles the lymphatic, nervous, and circulatory systems. Conservative treatments merely attempt prevent the spread of the disorder and treat symptoms. However, lipedema often spreads regardless of treatment through estrogen-based events such as puberty, pregnancy, and even menopause.**

Waterjet-assisted liposuction is a lymph-sparing procedure specially designed for lipedema. It is NOT a cosmetic procedure. It is done under local anesthesia and is extremely painful.

\* -- I'm delaying the fourth surgery until it becomes painful/necessary, but lipedema can spread in the untreated area\[s\] even faster if other areas have had lipedema removed. The final surgery would be $8,300. I've had doctors in Germany confirm via emailed photos that I definitely have lipedema in this area.)

&#x200B;

# Results of Surgeries (so far):

Since my first surgery alone (lower legs), my physical therapy sessions have improved dramatically. My balance, gait, and overall mobility have become much better than expected. My legs have full feeling now (sometimes more than I'd like -- tables hurt.) **AND my fat no longer hurts to the touch!!!** It used to hurt to be poked or squeezed!! I thought everyone felt this until a rheumatologist explained it was NOT normal. (Guys never understood why my body would hurt so much during.... intimate moments. I just figured they were being too rough.) In contrast, my arms -- which have not been done yet -- internally screamed in pain when I got a tight hug from a friend recently.

I make it very known on private lipedema forums that surgery was one of the best decisions of my life, regardless of the debt.

&#x200B;

# Insurance, wtf?

Most US insurance companies are in class action lawsuits because they keep arguing this is cosmetic, especially due to the lack of insurance codes, yet in spite of pre-cert letters and peer-to-peer discussions with my doctor. (Ironically, Aetna lists the procedure as the main medical way to rid of lipedema on their website... under cosmetic surgery.) I'm doing my best to appeal in the meantime.

However... I can't entirely blame them. Really. The World Health Organization essentially publishes all insurance codes it adds to a system called ICD-##. We are currently on ICD-10 and ICD-11 will come out in 2021. Part of the ICD-11 has been published for preview and includes lipedema (not the surgery though as far as I can find), however until this is fully published, insurance companies cannot use the codes.

Each country has its own department that handles their domestic interpretation of codes. Germany has had lipedema codes available for several years (including lipedema stages, which ICD-11 will lack) as an addition to their own system, but that system cannot be used anywhere but Germany.

The CDC and CMS manage the diagnostic and procedure codes, respectively. The CDC is not expected to fully implement ICD-11 until at least 2025.

&#x200B;

# How am I giving back and how you can help non-monetarily!

* Demographics for lipedema are severely lacking. A small study was run in 2013 in Germany stating the demographics are: 11% of women and two men. Not 2%, two men. No racial breakdowns. No cis/trans breakdowns, which scares me tremendously for MtF transfolx given the disease's reaction to estrogen (and possibly other hormones, we don't know enough yet.)
* I have developed my own survey that will run for the next few months gathering demographics and other medical history to try to establish trends for new researchers to explore without having to deal with university red tape. (I am keeping the data anonymous when publishing results.) I have already gathered 552 responses in one month.
* I plan on using this data to promote not only knowledge of the disorder but knowledge of the medical and research industries' absolute failure to get any reasonable research or promotion of this disease that's been known since Mayo Clinic discovered it 80 years ago. SO many patients (including myself) have come to doctors with nearly anorexic abdomens with disproportionately large and fatty limbs and are told to just lose weight and that it's all our fault. SO many patients are fooled into following diet and exercise trends which can actually harm our lymphatic systems and produce more lipedema. SO many patients on private lipedema forums are suffering from mental abuse from their spouses, friends, family members, coworkers, superiors -- whoever wants to shame them for something that is not their fault. **Ultimately, my goal would be to partner with someone like Jameela Jamil to make sure when someone goes to the doctor with lipedema, it's as easy to spot as someone with psoriasis, and it's treated with actual DIGNITY.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* My lipedema demographics survey is available here: [https://forms.gle/KM3wMJTWLMnoft956](https://forms.gle/KM3wMJTWLMnoft956)
* If you believe you or someone you know has lipedema, please fill this out/share to them. I am particularly interested in the underrepresented groups: WOC (particularly black and hispanic/Latina), men, and transfolx of any gender identity.
* I currently do not need data from people who do not believe they have lipedema.
* There is a privacy statement available on the first page that I take extremely seriously.

&#x200B;

If you can't donate, please share just for the sheer fact that people need to know more about lipedema, EDS, and dysautonomia. These conditions often go together and are often tied to traumatic events in family history or a patient's own life.

,My 15 year old son was in a car wreck 12/4/2019 that left him in a coma for a month. (He was not the driver) Please read our story.,"As the title says, my son was in an awful car wreck.  He was in a coma for a month and he’s now awake at a rehab facility.  We’ve been through so much in the past month.  He had a severe brain bleed, multiple head traumas, nearly severed his tongue in half, tore his tricuspid leaflet in his heart, had a collapsed lung, a fractured leg, and went into cardiac arrest twice his first week there.  

Though he is improving and we’ve been fortunate enough to have friends and family donate, we haven’t quite achieved half of our goal.  He still has several more days at this facility and then will move on to the next facility for the next portion of his recovery.  Leaving him alone is not an option as he cannot yet walk alone, feed himself, or otherwise take care of himself.  He started having seizures in his coma and has to be monitored for such for at least the next 6 months.  

We’ve been fortunate enough to be able to take time off of work to be by his side constantly (fmla) but that time is not paid.  We’ve exhausted our own personal savings and donations.   Any help would be greatly appreciated.  

My son is a kind, caring, genuine person and he was the last person I know that deserved this.  His whole life has been turned upside down and his life will never be quite the same again.  

I’m posting the GoFundMe link.  All proof and updates are contained within the link and I’m happy to provide any further verification someone might need.  We haven’t received any donations in about ten days and time for us is running out.  This is pretty much my last hope and I’m feeling defeated.

,"Looking to Help a Dairy Farmer in Maine Whose Land and Water Are Contaminated, Resulting in the Shutdown of His Farm","This GFM is for a friend of mine in Maine named Fred.  He is a dairy farmer whose farm has been in his family for over 100 years.  His son-in-law started the GFM page.

It was recently discovered that his land and his groundwater are both contaminated with chemicals called PFAS - per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances - nicknamed ""Forever Chemicals"" because they just don't break down.  There is more detail as to how this happened on the GFM page, but long story short, his cows ingested the contamination and became contaminated themselves, leading them to produce contaminated milk.  Fred's farm has since been shut down and while he and his wife have been trying hard to make a new living for themselves, it's been very, very tough.  They also both have health problems that are not helping things, and Fred recently spent nearly a week in the hospital.  I've seen firsthand the struggle that they've been going through.

They tried applying for aid through a federal Dairy Indemnity program but were turned down.  My heart just aches for them because they are such wonderful people and they've just been dealt a very bad hand lately, and it is through no fault of their own.

I know any amount would go a long way toward helping them.

Edit: Her story about him is on the page along with a video but I’ll put it here too: 

“Everyday on my drive to school I pass this elder gentleman selling newspapers on the same corner. One day it was below 30 and raining so I thought he wouldn’t be there. As I approached the corner I saw him wearing a yellow coat in the middle of the street waiting patiently for someone to call him over to buy a newspaper. He is a 67 year old man who has arthritis and he still stands on that same corner, rain or shine, to sell his newspapers. He told me his birthday is this month. Let’s all wish him a happy birthday.”"

,Family of child with Krabbe disease seeks financial help with treatment at Pennsylvania Hospital," “Krabbe disease (KD) (also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy or galactosylceramide lipidosis) is a rare and often fatal lysosomal storage disease that results in progressive damage to the nervous system. KD involves dysfunctional metabolism of sphingolipids and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.” This is what Valentina, a small child in Brazil, was diagnosed with even after the family noticed something was wrong with her and after doctors in Brazil stated there was nothing wrong. However, as the family pressed for answers to an obvious condition, it was discovered that Valentina had this disease.

My wife is from Brazil and as she discovered more about this child and her situation, she simply wanted to help however she could. She’s been in contact with the girl who setup the gofundme page.

Valentina’s family was able to locate doctors in Pennsylvania that could help her. Although her family was able to raise the money for the trip and the money down to begin treatment, she still needs $150,000 for the complete treatment. This is where gofundme comes in.

So I decided to help by getting the word out. The treatment is expensive for anyone, so anything helps.

If you’re interested in helping please feel free to donate or even pass the info along.

Thank you.

(Alfonso Flores) on August 31, 2019.  


Poncho's passion and love for life was contagious. If you were sad, he made you feel better. If you needed help, he was the first one to assist. If you were scared, he built up your confidence. If you were happy, he brightened your day so much more.   


Being of service to others was in his blood. He joined the Mexican Red Cross at an early age and followed it with service in the Army, as a Ranger and in the 82nd Airborne. He then became an LAUSD teacher (where he was awarded 2008 Teacher of the Year)  and later Principal, only to be fueled by the existing educational inequalities to become a force of change. He excelled as an educational and social justice advocate, consistently fighting for more equitable opportunities in schools for families in many cities. His heart was in every job he chose, person he helped, and community he worked for. The following articles written about him give an example of what an inspirational and compassionate man of God he was not only in his personal life but in every single aspect of his career:

As a family we are all helping but there is only so much we can do. Poncho was the sole provider for his wife Lourdes and four beautiful children- Sofia, Pablo, Ricardo, and Miguel. This has become an overwhelming situation with lots of need for help. She and the kids need help until she is able to find a job.  They are at risk of losing their home and struggling to cover everyday necessities. We ask that you please help us in passing along the compassion and generosity Poncho always showed everyone he crossed paths with. We are sincere in saying that any amount goes an extremely long way. We will ensure every donation collected is given to Lourdes to help pay for expenses.  


We thank you in advance from the bottom of our hearts for your help.  


Words and a story told to us by Lourdes that shine light as to who our dear Poncho was and will continue to be:  


“Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness.”

""A friend of Poncho's was struggling and needed money. She asked Poncho if he could help her out by lending her money. My brother as he is opened his wallet and saw he only had a bill of $50 and it was the only money he had for the weekend for food for his family.  He told me to wait right there as he ran to change  the bill. He gave me $25 and said, 'Take this, we will manage.'  He knew he  needed it but still gave it to me. I  will always be grateful to him.""

 Estar al servicio de los demás estaba en su sangre. Se unió a la Cruz Roja Mexicana a una edad temprana y la siguió con el servicio en el Ejército, como Guardabosques y en la 82a División Aerotransportada. Luego se convirtió en maestro de LAUSD (donde fue galardonado como Maestro del Año 2008) y luego Director, solo para ser alimentado por las desigualdades educativas existentes para convertirse en una fuerza de cambio. Se destacó como un defensor de la justicia social y educativa, luchando constantemente por oportunidades más equitativas en las escuelas para familias en muchas ciudades. Su corazón estaba en cada trabajo que elegía, la persona a la que ayudaba y la comunidad para la que trabajaba. Los siguientes artículos escritos sobre él dan un ejemplo de lo inspirador y compasivo que fue el hombre de Dios, no solo en su vida personal sino en todos los aspectos de su carrera:

He is self-employed and does not have medical insurance, so the costs of these surgeries will fall solely on him, and he will be out of work for quite some time. Anything you can give would be much appreciated

,Friend and fellow volunteer's house burned down.,"My buddy's house burned down while he was at the store. 

He is a military vet that now spends his time working/volunteering at a wildlife sanctuary. He gives SO much time to the sanctuary and deserves to get at least something back during this awful time. 

He lost several pets in the fire. I can't imagine that happening to me or how devastated he is.

,Outstanding Balance That's Keeping me from College,"I'm currently attempting to get enough money in to lower my balance $1,500 in order to return to schooo next semester. Normally I'd hate to ask for help, but I don't really have too many options. The next semester starts 10 days from this posting and if I can get my balance down, than I can't return to where it is that I'm meant to be. I could sit here and spin you a sob story about being diagnosed with a horrible disease or life getting in the way in unexpected ways, but the truth is I'm in this bad spot because of my actions and that of my family. I would've went for a loan from a bank, but my credit it none existent and my family's is through the floor. None of us can come up with this kind of money and so I've been left with this option along with scholarships and grants that I'm looking into. II need to go back to college, one way or another I will be going because I refuse to sit down and give up. I love my family, but I can't stay where they are, it's not a place where safety is ever present. I hope that you can spare something, every dollar helps and if you can't I ask that you share this around.

,"Tboned by Cop, had to fix my car on my dime until I’m able to file a lawsuit and win. I need this car to get to doctors appointments.","On Oct. 21 I and one other driver were Tboned by a Denver Police Officer. We had a green light when all of a sudden the officer hit the car next to me, the car next to me was then slammed into me. Our cars were span about 45 degrees  the police car ended up on the opposite side of the intersection. 

  The driver next to me wasn’t injured I however wasn’t so lucky. My medical history is very extensive I have some extremely rare medical conditions one that causes tumors to grow on my nerves and other organs called Neurofibromatosis. Another that is a rare spinal defect called Tethered Cord Syndrome. The tumors have invaded my spinal cord I can prove this to anyone that wants the back up. I can also prove the tethered cord. In 2018 I had to undergo radiation therapy in a last ditch effort to avoid an extensive surgery that would involve removing vertebrae, and the muscle around my spine to get the tumors out because they are growing in the spinal canal. As you can imagine the tumors in them self are very, very painful. The radiation did not stop the growth of the tumors, it in fact made them grow even more now I’m looking at being forced into surgery because the pain from the tumors has changed causing the pain to shoot into my groin and legs. Since the accident my hip and spine have been in a lot more pain we were hit at no less then 30 (or right about) miles an hour. 


Because it was a Police Officer that hit us I am having to go through a lengthy legal battle to even have my medical bills payed by the city of Denver. The car repairs came to 2,738.00.  As you can imagine by the medical issues I face on a daily basis it requires a lot of doctor appointments and I can’t rely on the bus because a lot of times the appointments come up last minute like the one I had with urology last week which I found out about less then a day in advance.  I also need the car to get to my part time job and back living in Denver is very expensive and I don’t have family, or friends that live close that I can rely on for a ride.   If you can find any extra little bit of money to help me fix the car I will find a way to pay it forward in the future.   If  you would like any proof of the things I have said don’t hesitate to ask I’ll happily 
send it. 

Edit I only had liability at the time of the crash before this car I drove junk to make things worse it was the car growing up I always told myself I would get one day.  I got it in mid June.  The insurance is my fault I’ll own up to that but the health issues didn’t help cloud my thinking I was distracted by those and didn’t think about going over my policy. 

After finding out my tumors had not stopped growing and the radiation hadn’t helped having a car to get out and drive somewhere to be alone and think gave me a a way to not let all of the negative energy build inside. Driving somewhere scenic was a move way to just decompress. 
Asking for this help is hard I feel bad having to ask but this coupled with my medical issues is just too much for me.

,Need help to keep home after sexual assualt,"I'm in a really bad situation and need help to keep my home. A few months ago I was sexually assulted which caused me to go into a deep depression I couldn't do anything but cry in bed for over a month. I was scared to go to work, scared to leave home. Now I'm about to lose my home if I don't come up with the money for legal fees & rent. I tried to take care of it myself but it's impossible my landlord will not let the debt roll over into the next month so paying $700 a week payments (to cover the legal, court fees, late fees and missed rent) on top of my rent is close to impossible. I've sold everything I could, my car was taken this is all I have left.

,Please help me stop my cheating ex-wife from ruining my credit and my life.,"Hello everyone.  I hate asking anyone for money, but I am in desperate need of help right now. Here is the full story: 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

After 14 years of marriage my now ex-wife had an affair and left me to be with the other person. I worked 40-60 hours a week for a decade to support her getting her bachelor’s degree and then going to med school. Our deal was always that if I worked to support us while she was in school, after she finished and became a doctor I could quit working full time and go back to school and/or pursue any career path I wanted to. 

After she finished med school, we moved to another city so she could begin her residency. I began grad school studying social work with the goal of becoming a mental health therapist and opening my own practice. 

Three months later she began her affair and within a month said she was leaving and wanted a divorce. 

Fast forward to now. I’m happy without her, and we have little to no contact. However, it turns out she has not been making payments on an $11,000 student loan that I co-signed on several years ago that she had to start paying back last year. She apparently does not care about ruining her own credit, but now she is ruining mine. 

Im 39 and have had credit for 20 years now. In that time there has not been a single late payment on anything. Not one. Credit cards paid in full every month, etc. My credit score was 818 at its highest. 

I recently got hit hit with my first ever negative on my credit report, and my score has already lowered because of this. I’m hoping to open a business in the near future and would also like to buy a home someday down the line. I cannot have my credit ruined. The social work field does not pay all that well unfortunately, and all of my money goes to rent, utilities, food, and paying my own student loans that I had to take out during grad school. 

I cannot afford to make payments on her loan. It’s physically impossible for me to do so. I tried talking to someone at American Education Services (the loan servicer), but they won’t accept a lower payment or work out any sort of plan. I also tried to get my ex to refinance it, but of course she refuses. 

I need to pay off this loan, get it off of my credit, and move on from my cheating ex permanently. I am desperate and am worried I’ll end up being ruined, be unable to pursue my career dreams, and who knows what else. 

I am setting the goal at 11,000, which is the amount of the loan.  If nothing else, I desperately need to at least pay the amount that is past due, because I was harassed by a creditor for the first time today. The past due amount is $357. 

Even a little bit will help, because I can use it to at least make payments on the loan in the short term. 
If the goal is reached, any extra will go toward opening my counseling practice. 

Thank you so much for reading this and for any help you can give.

,A friend of mine lost her job due to injuries and needs some financial assistance.,"https://www.gofundme.com/f/single-mom-whose-life-took-unexpected-turn?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-3

The gofundme link lists everything that had happened to her for the past few months, but to paraphrase what happened, my friend needs financial assistance for this month so she can find a full time job. She used to work as an assistant for a class that had special needs kids, and one of those kids attacked her one day, fracturing her legs.

Since then, she has had other jobs, but due to her legs swelling up, she was let go from her other jobs. Her son has special needs and can not attend classes for more than 3 hours, until his IEP is setup in 4 weeks, meaning that until then she can not work full time as she will be attending to her son after those 3 hours.

She is getting documents setup to work for Lyft and uber, as all the other jobs she applied for have not gotten back to herz nor has her applications for government assistance. So even small donations for gas money will go a long way.

Again, her gofundme is more detailed on what she went through and why she needs the assistance, so if you do have the time please read it! Thank you for taking the time to read my post, and I hope you all have a great day/night!"

,Young lady in need of some serious help,"Hello, I'm glad to get your attention if you have read this far. A family friend of mine is in a bad predicament. She has a rare brain tumour called DIPG which is explained below

Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a rare type of brain tumour that can't be operated on because of it's location within a crucial part of the brain, called the pons.  

This area is responsible for a number of critical bodily functions, such as breathing, sleeping and blood pressure.

The high-grade brain tumour, which mostly affects children, tends to grow quickly and often spreads to other parts of the brain or spinal cord.

Most diagnoses occur in youngsters between the ages of five and 10. The cause of the tumour remains unknown.

More than 90 per cent of its victims will die within 18 months of diagnosis, according to figures.

Each year, there are around 100 to 150 new diagnoses in the US. In the UK, it strikes between 20 and 30 each year. 

Symptoms include lack of facial control, double vision, headaches, vomiting, weakness, seizures and balance problems. 

One of the early indicators of the cancer is a child falling, tripping or losing balance.

,Hidden Disabilities Project - 2021 Animated Seried,"(On mobile, apologies for format). 

Me and other students in my school who have hidden disabilities or are helping the cause, are planning to make an animated feature film that will be available on YouTube by or before April 2021. I and these other students believe that an effective way to allow others to understand what it means to have a hidden disability is for it to be seen from our perspective, in an enjoyable and digestible way - via film. We also believe that hidden disabilities aren't represented in the media very much, and when they are, it's not done in a way that's understandable or personalized. 

We are raising money in order to get adequate equipment, such as microphones, drawing tablets and music keypads. We plan to highlight all those who contribute (if they so wish). Any and all donations are highly appreciated.

,Couple in need of assistance for housing,"Hi, I'm Tiffany and my wife and I moved to South Florida a little over a year ago. We moved because she wanted to be closer to her mother and she's always wanted to live in Florida. We've been staying with her mother since August of 2018. Recently, however, her mother and stepfather have been more than hinting that we need to find a place and leave. I know we have over stayed our welcome and I don't want any bad blood with my in laws. Our problem is this: we have both been steadily working since we have been down here and HAVE been saving to move. But every time we get a little into savings, some life event seems to happen. This past October, my wife's father passed away and we drained our savings account so that she could spend his last days with him. Then it's buying health insurance, doctor bills, etc. You name it. It pops up. It's frustrating because we are both working 6-7 days a week, so it shouldn't be a problem to save. And we are embarrassed to have to ask for help. But we really need it. We can afford rent, just not the deposit and first+last month's that most places are asking for. I apologize if this has gotten rambling. I just honestly don't know how to handle this or how to approach asking for help. Thanks for your time and thanks in advance!

,My best friend needs help legally changing his name,"https://www.gofundme.com/f/name-change-cost

Hey everyone! So my best friend Adam came out as transgender four years ago. In California, it costs roughly $500 to legally change his name, and he can't get a job to save money because of the strong hiring bias against trans people. 

Basically, when Adam submits a job application using their legal (feminine) name, when they show up to the interview looking like a man, there is usually strong sense of confusion and negative feelings from the interviewer, which makes finding a job very difficult. I understand this bias myself as I also faced job difficulty when I identified as trans. 

Getting his name changed would help Adam job search, which would help him afford college and get his life started as a young adult. It's unfortunate that it costs so much money but he needs to reach out for help because not having his name changes is preventing him from making money, and his family is not supportive of his gender transition at all. 

More info on him as a person is on the Gofundme. Thank you for your time!

My Mother (pictured above left), who I choose not to name due to privacy to her, has been fighting Cancer for the better part of 5 years. She has a form of Multiple Myeloma which is a debilitating blood cancer. Its a rare cancer, and we have had many treatments for it.

  
At first it was located in her left thigh, and she had Radiation twice a week. That killed her cancer, but unfortunately, it came back hard and very angry.  About a year and a half into the debacle we had arranged to remove the, now larger, tumor from her leg and on the day of the surgery, she slipped and fell in the shower and shattered her femur.

 
After recovering from that, the cancer again came back in the form of multiple myeloma, all over her body. She underwent chemotherapy, a stem cell transplant, complete hair loss, and finally she was cancer free. She is now on a maintenance chemo plan, and will be for the rest of her life. One round of this chemo will cost upwards of 1300 dollars. 

  
We have and always will continue to fight, and she is the strongest woman I have ever met. So far we have received help from some of the best doctors in the world, as well as aid from the hospital and various other charity funds such as American Leukemia Society, the American Cancer Society, and various others. We’re in the last leg of the recovery, but the bills keep piling up. We’re still over 25,000 in debt. My father works 60 hours a week, my mother is going part time back to her work, I’ve just started college, and my brother is starting his second semester of freshman year of high school. We’ve recently dealt with the passing of my uncle and my grandfather (pictured above left and above center), due to Cardiac Arrest and Lung Cancer respectively, and it has taken a toll on the family as a whole. 

  
My goal is to raise 15,000 to try to help with everything that is going on, including paying off medical bills, funeral loans, and various other expenses. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you in advance if you do try to help. Thank you all, and have a wonderful new year.

Hi, my name is Nicole and I'm 18 years old. 4 months ago i found a painless lump on my right armpit and I also check my boobs to see if i have any lump or any sign of breast cancer because my mom had a breast cancer so i really need to check mine. I don't feel any lump on my boobs so i ignored the lump on my armpit. I go to a surgeon because of my armpit lump. The doctor said i need to get a breast ultrasound to know what kind of lump is on my armpit. I got the result and he said i have a cyst on my right breast but it was too small and my armpit lump was big and he gave me antibotic for the lump. The doctor said i should have a breast ultrasound after 2 months to see if something change but i didn't have a chance to go to the doctor again due to financial problem.

On september, i started to have a breast pain and my left armpit started to have pain too but there is no lump. I also experience nausea, hot feeling on my neck and shoulder area and back and shoulder pain.

On the first week of october, i feel a lump on my neck and it was a pea size and the lump on my armpit got bigger also. I'm so worried of condition because it really got worsed. I called my doctor and he said i really need to take lab/medical tests and we need to prepare ₱140k (philippine money) = $2800 for the tests (ultrasound, pet/ct scan and mammogram) to determine my condition. The doctor said my case was rare and its a immediate medical care. I don't have health insurance and here in the philippines we don't have foundation that will help you with your medical test bill. We also talked to our government to ask for help but they said they can't help me due to the limited funds. I really have no choice but to create this fundraising to have a money for my medical tests.

Its been 4 months but my parents can't send me to the hospital due to the financial problem. Please help me and my family. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for reading this. 💜"
,Hamster found abandoned in the snow with a growth needs a vet,"Hi everyone,

UPDATE: The hamster has seen the vet, had what turned out to be a large abscess drained, and has been prescribed antibiotics and pain meds. They said he should be back to acting like a healthy hamster in 7-10 days!

Someone in my local area found a pet hamster **left outside in the snow**-presumably because of the large tumor/growth on its face (pics attached- its on their left side). The person that found the hamster couldn't care for it, so we took it on as my boyfriend and I have experience owning small pets and quickly made a bin cage for the little guy, until we get to the pet store today and get proper bedding, a wheel, etc. However, we need to get him/her looked at as soon as possible so we can treat the tumor on their face, and it'll be a financial hardship on us as we're both working college students and weren't expecting to pay for vet treatment of an additional animal. The campaign is currently just to cover the initial appointment but we will likely raise the amount/ start a new campaign once we know how much it will be to fix whatever is wrong. To clarify, **no matter what** this hamster is going to receive care on Jan 9th, and we will be paying the veterinarian with CareCredit. However donations will help us out greatly with paying off the CareCredit. Anyone who donates can request more pics of the hammy and even help us name him/her too. Thank you so much!

,Bronze the doberman needs help.,"I rescued this dog from a horrible situation during our recent move. I called animal control numerous times to report this doberman we now call bronze being beaten and left in a crate outside all year round. He constantly escaped and would come over into our yard and would would feed him and do what we could for him. 2 weeks before our move our drunken neighbor was outside kicking the crate and screaming at this dog for no reason before pulling him out and throwing him over the fence into the ditch outside while telling him to ""get"" ""go"". I was outside at the time went into the woods and got him. 2 weeks later we moved and he's now in a better house hold. He weighed 33 pounds when we got him. And he's now at 37. He's been to the vet and has multiple infections and problems that I can't afford to treat all at once such as a tick and fleas-(treated) kidney infection, UTI, Demodicosis-(treated), worms (being treated) hip dysplasia. Our veterinarian is trying to work with me in getting him treated but I can't do it by myself. I get paid every 2 weeks and I am doing what I can to help get this dog get back on track. The vet said he is about 5-6 years of age. He's a fighter but I need help to get him back to weight and treated. If you can help us with anything it would be greatly appreciated.

,"Building a Dream, Supporting a Community","Hello!

I don't know if you are aware, but Black women are 3 times more likely to die in childbirth in the hospital system than any other marginalized group in this country.  It was this small statement that started me on a path that has brought me joy and contentment and given me the ability to make a visible change in the lives of birthing people in my community.

Studies have shown that people feel more confident in their pregnancies when they are offered culturally competent care. Even better outcomes are possible when that culturally competent care is provided by someone who looks like them. So, when I was thinking about going to midwifery school, I took a look around to figure out where I could do the most good.

San Diego county, where I practice, only has one Black-owned birth center. There are also only 4 Black midwives. It was imperative to finish my education and become a midwife. A very dear friend of mine, who was a seasoned midwife, said to me,""Your perspective and your approach are necessary. You NEED to finish and become a midwife."" She believed in me so much that she volunteered herself and her time and expertise to help me with caring for my children, debriefing with me about births I'd been to and holding me while I cried from exhaustion, frustration and fear.

I am a Black woman.  I am a mother of two mixed race girls.  I am a Licensed Midwife in the state of California.  I have created a GoFundMe in order to help me raise capital to open my own freestanding birth center to help not only Black women and marginalized families, but ALL families.

[gf.me/u/xam6nm](https://gf.me/u/xam6nm)

My plan for my birth center is to support families of all stripes:

*Fathers:* support groups and newborn care classes for fathers, whom I feel can get pushed aside or deprioritized during childbirth preparation. So, I'm putting together gatherings in places for fathers where they will feel less emasculated, like barber shops and classes populated only with other first time fathers.

*Young people:* sex positive and realistic instruction on sex, gender and physical relationships. Not just ""Boys to this room and Girls to this room"" and ""Put a condom on a banana""  or ""DON'T GET PREGNANT."" Also, young women need to know that they have options when it comes to their reproductive health care.  They can choose to see a midwife for their STI testing, Pap testing and pregnancy and STI prevention education.

*LGBTQIA2+ folks:* Midwives in California are well positioned to perform IUIs and ICIs at home to support family building by our LGBTQ bretheren and sisteren. If a transgender man decides to become pregnant, a midwife would be uniquely positioned to provide inclusive, sensitive prenatal care and deliver their baby safely at home or at the birth center. Trans Men usually still have their cervix and uterus, those body parts do still need care and a midwife can provide that care, in home, in that person's safe space. I am currently helping to host a panel discussion on Trans Fertility with Trystan Reese, as well as hosting a teaching event about Trans Inclusion and Inclusive Language usage in practice.

*Black women:* Giving care to Black women and women of color is a particular joy for me.  It is important that Black families and families of color have an option to have their reproductive health care concerns and needs addressed by someone that looks like them and is culturally competent, and sensitive in their treatment. I am currently working with a charitable foundation to provide midwifery care to Haitian refugee mothers and Somali immigrant mothers.  Giving them one-on-one information about birth in the United States, how things are handled in hospitals and doing it with translators that *actually speak* Haitian Creole or Somali. (It boggles the mind how hospitals here in San Diego will give these families healthcare information in Spanish instead of Haitian Creole when they are able to communicate that they don't speak Spanish.)

I would appreciate donations to and sharing of my GoFundMe.  I feel like my work is important.  I feel like I make a difference and I am working toward having an even bigger impact, with your help. Thank you in advance for your generosity and sharing a plea for my cause.

My parents have recently fallen on hard times, and despite doing what i can to help them, there's only so much i can do as a 21 year old college student. Most of the family we have left are little help. 

My parents live in a rural area in North Carolina and their car is their lifeline. Civilization is tens of miles away. Without it, there's no money, no food, no way to get their very important prescriptions, nothing. They are disabled and are unable to work. They struggle to pay bills and afford food to begin with but recently their car has been taken from them and we as a family are at a loss.

,"Hi reddit, my family and I desperately need your help","My mother was a victim of dental malpractice when a dentist unnecessarily suggested to remove all her teeth to treat several infections. 

My mother is a Syrian immigrant and doesn't speak much English so she went along with it. 

Now, she's gone almost 4 years without teeth. We have tried going to several dentists to get dentures or implants, but unfortunately we were taken advantage of and given false promises by several different dentists. 

Now, my mother has suffered severe bone loss due to the lack of teeth in her mouth (in her upper and lower arches) to the point where she is in constant pain and severely handicapped. 

She is unable to eat and take in nutrients properly, and her face is beginning to cave in (for lack of a better term) due to the lack of bone. 

We tried seeking treatment at the NYU dental clinic, and after being wait listed for over a year, we were turned away because they said my mothers case is too complicated.

We were finally directed to a clinic named Clearchoice clinic, where they specialize in prosthodontics and more complex cases like my mothers. 

They immediately understood my mother's situation and laid out a plan to fix it. 
They are treating her like a human being with a medical condition, instead of seeing her need for teeth as ""cosmetic"" 

The treatment plan was fully laid out and explained to us in detail, and it's my mother's only hope to have teeth before she loses even more bone and has no option for implants any more. 

The only problem is that the treatment costs $59,000 ( a hybrid double arch replacement) and we are a poor immigrant family just struggling to get by. 
We have the option to finance through loan companies, but even the smallest monthly payments are too much for us to afford on top of all the other bills we already struggle with.

I can't sugar coat it even if I tried, my mother is in a terrible situation and we need serious financial help in order to do this procedure. 

We created a gofundme a little while ago and the link is at the bottom of this post.

My main hard drive is only 74GB and I decided that just getting a new hard drive wouldn't be enough.

,A lot of Bad Luck Medically is Stacking Up..,"Hello, my name is Brittany. I’ve never posted on Reddit for help like this before, but… I’ve been struggling for a while now, and a friend suggested I try here. I’m still a little nervous, but it’s just… not been a good year for me at all and I feel like the harder I try to get myself out of this hole, the deeper it gets.

In June of this year, I received surgery for tumor (about 12 inches in size, big enough that the “lump” was visible on my person) growing on my nerves due to a medical condition I have known as Neurofibromatosis. The job I had before the surgery was unwilling to give me the required time off, which left me stuck with only retroactive insurance as an immediate option (not at all cheap, and the insurance through work already sucked as it was.) I live in an At Will work state, so unfortunately, I didn’t have much wiggle room as far as actually raising a fuss against them for not giving it to me.

Because of the surgery, I was out of work for several months (from June until the end of October.) Which meant no income, and just… well, slow recovery. I tried selling fandom merchandise, crafts, and doing writing and embroidery commissions to supplement a little income to go toward bills, but… it’s been minimal. I was, fortunately, finally able to get a new job, but I have not been able to work during the month of December because I was injured at work. While I did qualify for medical worker’s compensation in relation to the injury, I had not yet worked long enough to qualify for FMLA or disability leave -- thus, that’s another month I’ve been without income. Meaning for the majority of this year, medical debts have been stacking while I’ve been unable to make enough income to meet life bills, student loan payments, and the medical bills. 

Because of all this stacking up one right after another, I've not made a dent in the medical costs I'd been trying to cover for so long. Originally, back when I first got surgery, I pleaded on tumblr for help and linked my GoFundMe (seen below) with all the images of proof I was comfortable posting (with some spots blacked out for my safety and personal information removal such as my location, medical ID numbers, etc.) 

Unfortunately, help was minimal. I was so incredibly grateful for the help I did receive, but between student loans and life expenses (monthly bills, rent, food) most of what I was making is just… swallowed up.

Overall, between the GoFundMe donations as of this post and money made from work, I've managed to pay off about $1,500 total between everything, but it's still a struggle.

GoFundMe recently had an update where, for some reason, one of my images was cut off (hiding the billing information) so I've reposted another one here (linked to my Google Drive.) This bill was moved to my credit card because, at the time, I thought I would better be able to handle all of this and paid off what had been there at the time, but... things didn't go as planned.

As one can see from the statements, more bills have fallen to it due to my cat getting sick (marked as A A Cat Clinic on the billing) to explain part of the change in numbers. I reposted the original charge that was cut off with it as well (seen on the left side of the overall image.)

Images I happened to take while in the hospital for further proof with aligning dates:

https://www.instagram.com/p/BzeMn2-hzkD/

https://www.instagram.com/p/BzjjdCch3ca/

There is even further information on my GoFundMe page (and a few more images) via the updates. I tried to summarize the important parts here. I had originally intended to share an image of the surgical site and scar as proof, but… as it is, quite literally, on my butt, I’m not comfortable posting those pictures. I hope you’ll forgive me for that.

At this rate, I'm just... exhausted. It feels like the harder I try, the deeper the hole gets and it's starting to feel impossible to climb out. So I come here at the encouragement of a friend in hopes that I might find help crawling out of this and getting back on my feet.

As a final note, thank you to anyone who can help me... I don't think I'll ever be able to express my thanks for any and all the help I might receive."

,Help with marketing self published book,"I honestly have no idea how well this will work and I'm abysmal at self promoting. 

I recently returned from Afghanistan after spending two and half years there as a contractor when I got out of the Army. While I was there I finally finished writing my first novel --- a dream I've had since I was a kid --- and in October I self published it through Amazon's Kindle Direct Program. Since then I've been attempting to self market it through the methods available to me, to include sharing the link to my book's page on various subreddits and through my social media accounts. My current favorite way to market it so far has been to mention it to my Uber rides on longer trips around DFW. I've had some luck with this, but that whole being abysmal at self promoting things keeps coming up. 

This brings us to me finally opting towards a new approach. I want to order several author copies of the book and start sharing them free of cost to local smaller bookstores, cafes, the USO, and to the few Uber rides that are genuinely interested in the story. 

I'm not sure how well this will work, but it's worth the shot and I definitely prefer the boots on the ground, grassroots approach and I'm hoping this gofundme campaign will help me get my story to as many reader's as possible.

I’m in the process of getting my condition looked after but the public health system is not a fast process so that will take some time. In the mean time, if you could help me out with just a few dollars that would mean the world to me. I’m just getting desperate at this point. Thank you.

,Glucose monitors for Irish town.,"I understand that there are bigger issues and fundraisers on this page, so I don't expect much or anything. This Go Fund me is for multiple glucose monitors in an Irish town. The monitors themselves cost €550 each and we're looking to amass quite a few. Monitors like this can really change a diabetic persons life and make their day to day almost hassle free. The device works by wearing the device under the skin. The monitor can then detect the glucose in the fluid around the body's cells rather than by taking a blood sugar count.

The reason why it's being funded is because this equipment is not provided by our Irish health service (HSE).

Thank you!

,My best friends fencing team needs help!,"
Hello! We are the Fencing Club at the University of Tennessee. We are a competitive collegiate fencing club based out of  UT, Knoxville. Our club has been active since 1967, making it one of the oldest sports clubs on campus. Over the past year, we have experienced a great deal of growth, and our club membership has nearly doubled, bringing our numbers to over 38 active fencers. Additionally, we recently hosted our annual fall tournament Szathmary Open, which drew fencers from across the Southeast to compete with us.

Each year, one of the most anticipated events for our fencers is the USA Collegiate Fencing Championships, a national collegiate team tournament hosted by schools around the country. Competing in this event allows us to expose our fencers to a level of competition that they do not often get to experience, and helps to reinforce our club's standing on the national stage. This year, Club Championships are being held in eastern Massachusets. 

However, due to the distance of travel and the arrangments for housing needed, we have found ourselves lacking in necessary funding. We have made efforts to procure additional funding from various sources within the university and the surrounding area, but they have proven to be insufficient given the cost associated with this year's Championships. In light of this, we would like to ask for your help.

In order to send the team, we are attempting to raise $5000 to cover the travel and hotel accommodations. Entry fees have already been paid, so all funds contributed to the cause will go directly towards funding travel. Any additional funds exceeding our goal will be used to provide equipment for the team.

We thank you in advance for your support of our club!

,My boyfriends mother has tumors and needs surgery.,"My boyfriend and I live together and have been just barely getting by financially, especially with the holidays recently we aren't in the best spot. We are in the process of obtaining citizenship for his mother because she lives in Brasil still, while he had moved back to the US. It has been a while since he has seen her so this news is discouraging. We had learned within the last week or so that his mom has uterine tumors that are benign, but they are causing internal bleeding and she will need surgery to have them taken out. The health insurance that she has is public which means that everyone has access to it and there is a long wait time. It wont cover the full cost and she doesnt make enough to get better insurance.  The cost for the surgery is 5200 reais or about 1,300 US dollars, and his mother does not have the money for it so we would like to help her out. She will have to go in a few days and anything will be greatly appreciated.

,Hip Surgery for a 60yr Old former bodybuilder,"Hey folks

My dad's name is Vincent Eric Ross. He is 59 years old, and was born in a little town in Florida just outside Daytona Beach to Jack and Ollie Ross. He had several older brothers who served in various branches of the military during the 60's and 70's. While the family tree has always been hard to track down fully, one of his siblings was the famous painter, Bob Ross. We have numerous photos of a younger Bob holding my dad. Of all the family, of my father and the youngest child, Elizabeth, are still with us today.


At 59 years old, his joint health has taken a rapid decline from years of being a carpenter, doing roofing and framing construction. His hip has become loose in the socket and is constantly bouncing around and making contact with his femur. He is in desperate need of surgery to fix the issues with his hip. He has no way to be able to do daily activities for himself without being in severe pain and he's gone from being a very active man to one who struggles to make his own meals without having to spend the rest of the day in pain. Since a very young age, he has always been very dedicated to physical fitness and martial arts. He has been unable to live his normal lifestyle, or even stand even short periods of time, which has thrown him into a deep rut. He struggles to put his socks and shoes on, to get up and down for sitting or laying down, or even showering. As a young teen, he was the victim of a hit-and-run whilst in a parking spot on his motorcycle. He was wheelchair bound for over a year due to severe damage to his hip, knees, and ankles. The accident left his left ankle nearly completely separated. During his 30's, he worked 60hrs a week in construction, building commercial facilities and residential homes in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Consistent years of roofing work was very detrimental to his joint health, which culminated into the lack of any gel to protect the area around the socket and joint. For a time, he was able to get an injection into the hip socket which would fill the void area with a gel substance but this no longer lasts more than a day and his doctor recommends against it. Since his 50's, he has endured many months of constant and severe joint pain in his hip and ankles from his accident and prior work history but nothing as bad as his hip currently is. The hip will sometimes lock up and he will be unable to stand at all, resulting in a excruciatingly painful pop when he moves.

He has always helped take care of other people and now he needs some help so that he can become functional on a daily basis again. He is unable to work, and so has no insurance. We are looking for anyone willing to help him raise the funds to get back to his normal life, and live out the days he deserves.

Thank you all very much for taking the time to read this. All help is greatly appreciated.

,"I had to get an MRI, and they still don't know what's wrong.","Back in October, I had to go to the hospital regarding some startling problems. My left side would go numb, my vision blurred intensely, and I had serious bouts of confusion on a near-daily basis. I was convinced it was a stroke, but that was ruled out. 

The doctor's ordered an MRI, figuring it was a neurological problem. This turned out to be wrong as well, and I've hit a wall at this point. I'm still dealing with the issues. The only thing we've been able to understand is that it's related to stress in some way - it flares up when I'm in extremely stressful situations. I had to put my college education on hold because I couldn't balance a job, schooling, and my health issues. 

I've been making small payments on the bills, but it's not enough. It'll take me years to pay off the hospital expenses as I don't have much left after I pay my monthly bills.

I'd appreciate any sort of help I can get. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

,Help a Young Carer follow his dream education,"Hi Everyone,

My name is Will, but people call me Billy.

As the title suggests I am a young carer for my dad, who has MS, and my sister, who has a partial deletion of chromosome 7 (which leads to a big mix of physical and learning disabilities).

I love my family not only because they have blessed me with many opportunities for personal development as a result of the challenges that have faced us but also because they are giving up a lot of their own dependence on me so that I can pursue a career-enhancing education.

This education is a masters course to become a physicians associate within the NHS- a nearly affordable opportunity for me to help others. Growing up with a family of medical problems I have felt the impact that health professionals provide; educating families on the conditions and communicating treatment plans. these actions have made my family able to focus less on what we cant do and appreciate all we can do, they have helped us all enjoy every moment we can. I want to give that to families, help others focus less on their conditions to enable them to spend more time doing what makes them happy.

However, funding by the government for two-year masters courses is not thought through and devastatingly I won't be able to afford this opportunity to follow my dreams.

I am angry at the system. To think that so many talented individuals may be deterred from a career because they can not meet the financial requirements of the education to get there. It's heartbreaking and is complete wasted talent.

I have been campaigning for better support for students and will continue to until funding reflects the costs of education. However, until then I find myself in the position of many students, asking and hoping that kind and empathetic people will help out and give anything they can to help fund a dream.

From the bottom of my heart I thank you for reading this, and maybe sharing with a friend the injustices of the system.

For any proof of my personal situation and any more information pertaining to this post feel free to inbox me and I will help to clarify things.

**Our Goal**

My name is Amanda, and *I am trying to raise money to help get my girlfriend out of a toxic living environment, as it has been* ***and still is*** *detrimental to both her physical and mental health.* Currently we live on opposite sides of the United States, but my hope is that I will be able to move her in with me to get her out of her poor living situation.

**Our story**

Currently, my girlfriend lives with her grandmother away from her immediate family, as her immediate family is physically abusive and unrecognizing of her identity. This abuse and failure to accept her for who she is has caused severe depression and anxiety to develop, to the point there have been multiple instances requiring professional intervention. Unfortunately, due to the stagnation of her life, her mental health has been deteriorating and her current living situation makes her unable to make effective use of professional help.

**Our costs**

It is our belief that moving her away from the negative environment she was raised in will allow her to seek the help she needs in a more welcoming area; as well as allow her to expand and grow as a person. We would use any funds gained from this towards the costs of moving her across the country, including plane tickets, shipping costs for her belongings, hotel and rental car for me to be able to be present and help her with the moving process, and as a small net to help us settle in to our new life together.

**How you can help**

We would greatly appreciate any help you could give us, even if all that means is you share this on social media. It would mean the world to both of us to finally be able to be together and help each other grow and mature as people.


**Thank you for taking the time to read our story.**"
,Help this little girl get her treatment,"https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-vesper-van-haar-sonde-af

Our Vesper is born with 33 weeks. After a tough start in intensive care, she was finally allowed to go home without a probe. The first problems started at home. Her development did not proceed as normal and after a few months a developmental delay in combination with muscle weakness was found. She also didn't eat anything outside of breastfeeding.

The therapies in the Netherlands can no longer do anything for her, so we now want to try it through NoTube. This will be done through net coaching. With this therapy she can stay at home, in her safe environment where she cannot be triggered by misery. And since the insertion of the probe gives her the most fear, it is important that she gets rid of it as quickly as possible.

With more than 90% chance of success, this is our last hope and we see it very positively. And the therapists at NoTube are also confident that this will be the breakthrough.

Unfortunately we do not have the money for this treatment, so we ask for your help with great objection and restraint!

We will be eternally grateful to those who want to help us, large amounts or small. This will change her life forever."

,I have a question about if it would be right for me to attempt a GoFundMe page for my mental health issues,"I suffer from PTSD, complex depression,  DID (Dissociative identity disorder) and lots of other mental  and physical health problems.  All due to severe abuse during my marriage, years ago and several other traumas endured since. 

I recently decided to end all my suffering but failed. I'm still in the mindset that it's the best course of action to stop the physical (chronic pain from skull fracture, etc...) and mental pain I'm in 24/7.
I had written a letter to whomever would find my body.
 Reading the letter over and over, including to my therapist,  it's made me more depressed then ever but also gave me an idea of at least trying to stabilize,  if possible.
I told my boyfriend of 5 years (who holds 100% financial control,  since I'm unable to work,  and am not allowed to have more the $2 of cash on me at any time, which, I know, is abusive), that I would love to try to take a 3-4 day vacation alone to a warm weather place with a beach in hopes it would relax my brain enough to reconsider taking my own life. He knows I am suicidal. He had no issue with me going anywhere but told me that the cost of the flight ($250-$300) and hotel (which he has Marriott points that could cover some of the hotel cost but would not waste them on me), plus a rental for the 3 -4 days, were not something he wants to spend on my ""fantasies"" right now. I know for a fact we have the money but also he wants to get a new gaming pc, so my trip would cut into that cost. 
Being unable to work at all due to my health, ""NO"" is all I can accept.  I cannot argue for it. He knows I'm suicidal and why I wished to take the trip but also knows he has 100% control over what I can do or where I can go.

I'm not someone that has ever asked for donations.  I have always given my time, expertise, free training for kids who don't get a second chance normally,  helped anyone that needed help and always given all o could (physical) so the thought of setting up a GoFundMe page is just horrible to me. If, however,  I did set one up, what explanation would I give and is this something people may actually give for? 

I'm leaning more in the direction of not being a burden to anyone anymore.  I just thought some time alone, away from his toxic behavior and reviewing my life in a nice and warm place would be worth a shot. 
But if people here believe nobody would even  care to give to a person such as me, I would rather know so I don't embarrass myself if I set up a page. 
Any idea if it's worth it?
(My family disowned me after being diagnosed with DID and I had to give up ALL friendships in order to appease my boyfriend.  I literally have nobody to ask for financial help). I calculated 4 days,the total for flight,  rental and hotel to be around $700-$750 or less (since his Marriott points will not be ""wasted "" on me, I have been told).
Please, any advice would be super helpful. 
But if nothing comes of it, I can always go back to plan A.

Thank you for any insight you may bring me."
,My 15 year old stepson was in a car wreck and has a traumatic brain injury. Please read his story.,"On December 4th, 2019, my 15 year old stepson was involved in a car accident.  On his way to school, he rode with three friends that morning.  The driver of the car suffered a seizure behind the wheel.  Their car crossed the center lane, into a ditch, and ran for over 1000 ft before slamming into a concrete structure.  

He suffered a multitude of injuries.  Traumatic brain injury in two different parts of the brain, whiplash, a torn heart valve, a collapsed lung, a nearly severed tongue and a fractured leg were just the beginning of what the days to come would bring.  Ultimately, he was placed in a medically induced coma with a shunt in both his brain to drain off hemorrhaging as well as a shunt in his lung.  In total, he spent 18 days in a coma, drained 9 liters of blood/cerebral spinal fluid off of his brain, and he coded twice in that time.  His mother was present both times, and these days were the hardest.  

Eventually the decision was made to wake him because he was not improving on the ventilator.  Waking him was difficult and tough.  His tongue had now swollen to fill the whole of his mouth and it was understood that if we took the ventilator out we would not be able to get it back in because of this, and that a tracheotomy would be our sole option.  

After five incredibly scary days off of the ventilator, he gradually began to improve.  His weight loss was significant—-40 pounds total.  He was on a tube feed during his coma but wasn’t fed correctly by staff.   His mom has since had him transferred to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta where he’s spent the past 3 days.  During this time he’s made improvements and started to gain weight back.  It’s still a long road ahead for our family.  He will be at this facility for a minimum of 3 weeks, and then to an outpatient rehab thereafter. 

His mom has been by his side since the accident occurred.  This means a significant loss of income, as well as many new expenses related to hospital care.  We are not a wealthy family by any means.  

His aunt started a GoFundMe approximately one week after his accident.  We’ve been fortunate enough to have many friends and family donate to this cause, but we still have a long way to go.  Some things the fundraiser has paid for so far:  hotels, parking deck fees, gasoline, food, new clothing for him due to weight loss, physical therapy tools, Christmas presents, and bills that were unable to be covered due to mom not being able to work.  The loss is significant.  

Currently, she is down to just $100. :( 

I am providing a link to the GoFundMe which has in it proof of claims, daily updates on my stepson, progresses, and we’d be happy to provide any other information for validation.  Please consider reading, sharing, or donating.  I will be cross-posting this.

I've been inspired to follow my dream of starting my own business. I am a writer, I've always been a writer, in elementary school I was rewarded with dinner with our state's governor due to submitting my work in a state wide contest. I know it seems so original but all I want is to be given a chance to really shine while doing what I love the most. 

 Alot of people say things are going to be different then just forget they have said it. However,  I am not going to be that person and I've taken every possible step towards preventing that. The main one being Accountability for me. So, I've got alot of support as far as mentally and emotionally, alot of that support also coming right here from my new Reddit family! Now, I am here to ask this.

Please keep an open mind when considering my campaign.  I do not just want to ask complete strangers to send me money but I have been advised that this would be my best option. I'm also asking that if you wouldn't feel comfortable donating money but you'd like to help by donating something that I need, please dont hesitate to do so. In the event that an item is donated instead of money, I will revise the amount and update my campaign so that it is known I most longer need that. 

I'm just an honest woman wanting to know what it feels like to succeed in every aspect of the word. Please help me share my story and reach my goal.

,My close friend recently became homeless and I would really like to help get him back on his feet.,"A close friend of mine recently became homeless after being evicted for being unable to upkeep his duties at his home. He is a great friend to me and was always willing to help me and include me in his activities. He got me interested in many games and got me to make many new friends with similar interests as me. Before meeting him I was always an introvert and a loner, but with his kindness, I've been able to change that and make more friends.  The picture on the GoFundMe page shows one of the many things I've been able to do with other people since he invited me to his server and introduced me to new people. With this money, he could rent a small home and be able to find a job that could help him continue on in life. Without him, my life would have been completely different and I wouldn't be as happy as I am nowadays. I don't know exactly how I'm going to get this money to him if it gets anywhere, but I know I will figure it out. As long as I am able to help him get back on his feet and get him out of his struggles like he has done to me, I will be grateful for everything I can do.

,Medical Bills For Breast Cancer Patient and Family,"This link is a repost from a few weeks ago.  My wife was diagnosed with apparently a rare and difficult type of breast cancer while she was pregnant.  Once the baby was born she did multiple rounds of chemo and surgery.  Things were looking good until recently it was found that a swollen area contained a lymph node with cancer cells present.   No other information is known about it at this time pending additional tests and scans.

We have been paying what we can towards the medical bills as they come in, but it hasn't been enough each month and one has gone to collections.  Its embarrassing for me, and i'm too ashamed to go to family for this or to post on facebook, so I guess I look to strangers on a website.

Thank you for your time in reading this.

,My sister recently fell into a coma and me and my family don’t know what to do.,"Sorry for my wall of text. I’m not the best at conveying my feelings and thoughts to text.

We got a call at 4am, December 17th from my sisters dad saying she had a cardiac arrest and fell into a coma. I was already having a depressive episode in my life so it really hit me hard. She just had a kid, 15 months old, who is just the biggest ball of joy anyone has seen before. It pains me to even talk about her condition but medical bills are ridiculously high. Me and my 2 other sisters had to spend all our Christmas money and savings to fly up to New York to visit her. We live in Florida and she lives in Manhattan NY. Plane tickets were kinda expensive because of the holidays and New York in general is much more expensive than Florida.

Anyway, doctors are saying she is improving but after almost 3 weeks, she isn’t conscious. She opens her eyes and licks her lips but doctors said if she does recover, it will take a LOT of therapy. Once she does recover enough for them to move her, she will be coming down to Florida with us because we have a lot of family that can watch over her as she recovers.

Her medical bills are no joke and me and my mother can’t do this all alone. I was actually about to go back to school the following semester as my New Years resolution and don’t think I mentally can.

I don’t know what else to say. I’ve just been drifting along while all this happens, not really helping my family at all. Sharing our gofundme is the least I can do . Please help, or pray for her. She was my role model and I honestly don’t know how I would continue living if she died.

,"Need a hand, and an angel","After some thought and some positive talks with others, I am continuing to post this. And thank you (you know who you are) for the talk and for allowing me to know it is ok to not be ok, that people do just go through hard times and regardless of what others say it is ok to ask for help. So I will be trying very hard to remain positive) try to hold onto hope.  Things have not improved outside of some kind words, and two thoughtful donations. I am pasting what I had wrote before and adding some to a question someone had asked before.

I have tried this GoFundMe thing once before, I didn’t get very far and as I have limited family and no actual friends or social media I have found it very hard to reach out to people and ask for help, more so with this Gofundme and the comments and private messages, it all takes its toll...and maybe that is just how things are meant to be, I was always the one with my hand out to others mainly my family....now I just been stuck on the other end.

Fast version is in 2018 I lost two of my closest family members, my grandmother and uncle both from CHF I did all I could to help in every way, including financially which really put me in a bad spot but I don’t regret that. I had a job so bills were paid, credit was being stretched then I lost my job at the college I attended and my credit carried me some as well as some odds and ends jobs. Sold just about all I could on eBay to just float by hoping to get stable work but that has not been fruitful. 

My original GoFundMe was to help with bills and my debt, that has come and passed now getting lawsuits threats and endless calls. ( from debt collectors) I am still trying to come up with about $400 for more immediate things, but do not feel that will come( I am under a hardship for my power currently, and Internet and cellphone are a must to keep doing what I can to make money and find stable work)., Eh the link to my GoFundMe is here if anyone feels it is worth giving, I am not currently dying (I have food...the $0.20 a pack noodles) and see so many others in need it is just sad. I am so tired and stressed, I have thought of going to the borrow sub here but being honest I highly doubt someone would lend money to someone knowing that I could not pay back anytime soon if at all and I would clearly state that if I posted. I been scammed before ( but I’m getting wiser to them) and it is not a good feeling, more so when in need, so please no DM saying you have an opportunity for me just to try and take or use me, really can’t handle that stuff right now.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, In time I look forward to be the helping not the helped once again

At the moment everything is fixed and I can pay Uni every month, however it doenst make up for the already existing debt.

Here's the gfm link. I will run over it to update details in a bit, however for now I managed to attach all documents I consider important to proof my financial problems, as well as a listing from my uni of what I owe.

I remember people being upset that I picked a private university, so let me explain why: I have many health conditions that prevent me from plenty of jobs, so there wasn't much to chose from. The second Problem was that the one thing I wanted, just wasn't avaiable anywhere else (Communication Design) to a degree that this university offers as well as being approved by the state. Its complicated and I know it is fully my fault, but trust me when I say that I should have been able to pay things normally of everything didn't turn so messy.

I'm a student. I got diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma few years ago, after 2 years of chemotherapy I hope I beat it. I'm starting to feel well and the only thing that kept me up is my love for music. I often played in between my therapies to cheer up and entertain other patients. I also volunteer to associations. I sweared that if I ever survived I would get a degree in music and give back to the community to start free music courses for people with disabilties.

I currently play on a plastic 35 years old clarinet that is falling apart, the technician said it's not worth to repair anymore. For my conservatory studies I would need a wooden professional one or they would never let me get a degree. I don't ask for a new one, the goal I put is the exact amount they asked me for a used one. I come from a not wealthy family and I do little jobs to pay my studies, as my health still doesn't allow me to work fulltime or do hard works. I have already asked but in my country we don't have scholarships here or any financial help to buy instruments.

Hope you can help me, if you can't help I only ask you to please share my campaign to musicians or people that can help :)

She went in for gastric bypass surgery recently and everything seemed to go well, but within a short time, she began 
experiencing issues. The doctors discovered that the surgery had left a small hole in her intestine. The leak into her abominable cavity has wreaked havoc on her: sepsis, E. coli infection and strokes (the effects of which have yet to be determined).

Most recently, it was found that the sutures from the second operation to close that hole had failed, again allowing leaking into the abdominal cavity. A third operation has closed this.

She is in ICU with family keeping a constant vigil. Her husband is, as you can imagine, beside himself trying to care for the household (two teenage children), support his wife and still work to keep money coming in. 

And that is where this GoFundMe campaign comes in. While they have insurance to cover most of the medical bills, the loss of her income, his needing unpaid time off and the multitude of additional expenses not covered by insurance is taking its toll and 
adding to his stress. 

Trisa is a good person, always willing to help others, whether through her work as a veterinary technician or in her personal life. Here are some of the comments from those that have already contributed:

- ""Trisa has been there for my family in one of our most devastating moments......""

- ""She has given so much to so many""

- ""You were there for us in the saddest time of our lives. We are here for you now.""

- ""Trisa is an amazing woman.""

Any contribution you can make will be greatly appreciated by myself and her family.

,Second Chance for Lester,"Hello everyone,

I am reaching out you to get help for my cousin, Lester, who is currently fighting for his life.

A little back story. Lester and I grew up in our humble town of Bolbok, Batangas, Philippines. We are both same age so we grew up very close. We would play games, go to picnic, pretend as a character, and just living the best childhoon. He was my bestfriend growing up. 

But when I was 12, my family and I decided to live our lives in Canada but have kept communication througout the years. As years passed, Lester stayed as that kid who never was in trouble and always focused himself on his education and he was able to get his degree and liscence in Mechanical Engineering. But because of financial instability, he took his chances in Dubai to find a job to be able to help his mom with her dialisys.

In Dubai, he suddenly became ill. His doctor diagnosed him with dry pneumonia that would creep over and over again. As a result, he was in and out of the hospital and found that he was spending more time there rather than looking for wokr. His anxiety got the best of him and his immune system dropped fast.

He flew back to Philippines and was immediately taken to the Intensive Care Unit where they found that he only had 50% oxygen in his body and that the infection has taken over his lungs. Currently, his health is deteriorating but he is still fightting and all of us can see it.

Right now, his bills are piling up, I also have sent money but my funds are also limited. That is why I started a go Fund Me page for my cousin. I am knocking at your kind hearts to provide and form of contribution to help with Lester's treatments.

Adaminaby was pretty much abandoned by National Parks, who’s land was ablaze and fighting the uncontrolled fire was left up to the few RFS members of the small community.

I’m raising funds for them directly, for their personal sacrifice and to help bolster the equipment they need to continue fighting.  The fires are far from over unfortunately.  The town has few resources and many of the trucks and equipment need to be hired from towns hours away, all which cost money.  Every dollar helps

,My husky had to have emergency surgery,"This past Saturday, we took our husky, Hoshi, to the emergency vet around 2am. He had been acting strange all day, and got worse as the day progressed. He had weird episodes where we though maybe he was having mini seizures, as he is epileptic (I took video to show the vet, we later confirmed with the vet that he wasn’t having seizures, just severe pain episodes). 

Later in the day, he threw up, and we thought that maybe he just had a really bad stomach ache. We checked with our normal vet, they said he could probably wait to see them until morning., but told us to go to the E vet if he got worse. Then late that night/early the next morning, he started heaving without producing anything. His stomach was hard, and he was trying to run from me (which he never ever does - he’s currently cuddled next to me). 

We immediately took him to the emergency vet, where they X-rayed him and found that his stomach was filled with fluid. They drained over 700ccs of fluid before they were able to get a decent picture of what was wrong. He had eaten part of a plush toy, and it got stuck in his stomach and intestines. He needed surgery immediately. 

Obviously, we moved forward with it, and he’s now recovering well. He stayed with them around 36 hours total, had a tube in his little nose to drain the fluid from his stomach, got his stomach and intestines cut open, and had to have his entire stomach shaved for the procedure. He hates his cone, and he get quite upset if we leave him alone. I’m trying to work from home to care for him. 

The final bill came out to just under $5200, not including getting his staples out or any follow ups. 

Any help is greatly appreciated, whether it’s donations or sharing my gofundme, or even well wishes. I’m so happy my boy is alive to continue driving me nuts with his sweet crazy antics.

,Working father has work van and equipment stolen,"My father had the terrible experience of having his work van with supplies,wallet and phone stolen from him while doing a job on 1/3/2020. Juan was doing plumbing for a deli and had left his car unattended for short moment so he could bring in plumbing supplies to the deli he was working at. Once he came back out to the car it was gone as well as his phone and wallet . The cameras from the deli were not able to capture much except for an individual coming toward the cars direction and then seeing the car drive off . We tracked the car for a bit since his phone was still in it with find my iphone but it eventually stopped moving somewhere in the bronx. The police investigated but were not able to find or see anything since the individual most-likely just threw the phone out. This gofund me is to help my father buy new tools and equipment, he is a hard working man and the main source of income for the household .

,We have been robbed twice and now we have a funeral to go to,"On Dec 18th and then again on the 24th our home was broken into and robbed. They took everything and we are still waiting on insurance to help cover paying for the damages. I wouldn't be asking, but because it happened at Christmas time, we don't have enough money to cover expenses. 

One of these major expenses is a funeral we need to go to. It is out of the country and tickets range from $700 to $2000. We're trying to book as soon as possible so the prices are lower, but with how many of us are going, we are looking at maxing out on credit cards.

What we are able to raise is just to keep our heads above water financially, nothing more.

,"Father unexpectedly passed away and left behind three children on New Years Day, this will fund his cremation service that my mother can’t afford","Anything helps, even just a simple share. My father left 3 children on New Years Day and we have no way of paying for his cremation, I’m 18, my little brother is 16 and my oldest brother is 20. My mother only makes $300.00 a week baby sitting and this entire situation has been so stressful on us, while we should be mourning the loss we are instead stressed to the max on how we will pay for everything, my PayPal which had $180.00 in it went limited a month ago and I have to wait 6 months before PayPal allows me to move the money, this $750.00 will cover the cremation cost which we could keep at our house while we make enough for the burial stone and funeral costs. We’re behind on the house payment so it just adds SO much more to the situation, this $750.00 will go a long way and my mom has no clue I’m doing this yet, I’m afraid that I’ll get her hopes up because I don’t know how well it will go, I’ve never asked for money or made a GoFundMe before because I don’t like to ask for much, but this is something out of my control and can only be resolved by others, thank you so much, like I said ANYTHING helps.

,Help Needed to Fund a Manual Custom Wheelchair,"I'm having trouble leaving my home due to severe joint pain in my legs and other parts of my body. I've tried to get help from doctors for years, but I can no longer wait for them to help. I've tried using a cane to help me walk but as I tend to trip over my own feet constantly adding a third tinier foot just made things worse.

I have neurological and physical disabilities that stop me from being able to use other modes of transportation. I can't use the bus as it triggers seizures, I can't walk or ride a bike because of balance and joint pain issues, and cab fares are expensive. I believe a manual wheelchair would best suit my needs.

I'm almost completely home-bound unless I have cab fare now. With a wheelchair I will be able to go see a doctor when/if needed throughout the month, drop off and pick up prescriptions as needed, buy groceries, and I could even take my dog to the dog park several blocks away.

The issue is that without a proper doctor it would be close to impossible to get a custom wheelchair covered so I need to raise the money myself. The reason for a custom chair is that I am shorter than average and places where used chairs can be found tend to not suit my needs or fit my short legs.

I've checked local organizations out with no luck, and have asked close friends and relatives for help, I have what money I could raise this way saved in a savings account. I don't need the chair inside my apartment so the assistive devices program is also a no go as you must need it indoors and outdoors. In a bit of desperation I even called my mother who I haven't spoken to in years (bad idea, which I am still dealing with emotionally).

I already know the wheelchair I would like to purchase, the Quickie GPV Sports Everyday use Wheelchair, and have gone over the sizing and options for it. I've even decided on a colour, black cherry! Everything is ready I just need enough money to cover all the expenses. 

I do not need an electric/motorized scooter or chair as I can still use my upper body to push myself.

I've been debating as to whether or not to get some frog leg casters for it as they would help with my joint problems, but that would add to the expense and I don't want to ask for too much.

,GIVE JOY MCCAIN,"[https://www.gofundme.com/f/give-joy-mccain](https://www.gofundme.com/f/give-joy-mccain)

&#x200B;

My friend Joy is having brain surgery.

Joy is a single mom, and she has a barely-operable tumor, requiring a dangerous operation, with an equally dangerous four-to-six month recovery.

Joy is the very model of the can-do mom, the mercurial takes-care-of-everything secretary – and determinedly positive and upbeat.

She is also a cancer-survivor, from when she was young – a very serious cancer that required twenty-four hour a day chemo-therapy.

Her situation now is that she must, first survive the surgery, without going blind or suffering brain damage, but then being laid up for several months – a period during which she cannot get sick, because coughing or sneezing (involuntary actions) can cause brain bleeds – daunting all by itself, as her early bout with cancer has compromised her immune system.

She has also been trying to continue at work longer than she should, because she's concerned about her family.

Last week, her tough facade finally broke down just a little bit, and she started to cry in frustration – 'It's just not fair.'

All I could say was, no – absolutely it's not.

I can't help her through her surgery, or through her recovery, but hopefully I can do something to at least lighten the load.  My goal is to try to cover six-months salary, and at least give her a fighting chance to get back on her feet.

Anyone looking to give this year, here's a good person that needs it.

,I have surgery in 2 weeks and need help to cover some of the bills while I am off work recovering,"I have to go in for FTM top surgery a bit sooner than I was planning, I was hoping to put it off another year due to finances however other health issues have popped up and are directly affected by my chest weight and binding.   
Warped ribs and breathing issues from binding   
As well as worsening arthritis of the spine from the weight over the last 15 years before I even started binding.  
These issues are affecting my employment and my ability to have a pain free day.

Sadly I live in a high cost of living place and pay most of my families bills.   
I also work a very physical job and cannot go back to work early as per the surgeon. 

I have the bulk of the money saved up but I will be short on some of my recurring bills while I recover for the 3 weeks that I'm not allowed to work. 

I am still trying to save, find money savings where I can, I'm finding out if I can delay payments on a few bills and have gotten a few friends to help me out while I recover as I won't even be able to properly dress myself for a few days. 

I've gotten the costs of the surgery and medicines/medical equipment covered as well as most of the transportation as the surgery is only offered 6+ hours drive there and back. So I just need help with my regular recurring bills as well as possibly lodging for the person driving me to and from unless we can find a spare bed or couch somewhere.

Linked is the gofundme I have just set up, on there I have listed the costs I still have outstanding as long as I have no serious complications during surgery.

,Help with Disabled Student's College Costs,"*(I'm horribly nervous posting here, so forgive me for copy-pasting my GoFundMe page details. I think I explained things ok on there and I'm too nervous to come up with a new post explaining things. You can ask me questions though and I'll try to respond in the comments.)*

&#x200B;

**About Me:** My name is Stephen, I'm 32 and working on getting my Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science here in Washington State. I grew up with some mental disabilities that have made work difficult to maintain, and so in 2015 I managed to get together enough money to start going to community college and work towards a Bachelor's degree. I finished my Associate's degree in 2018, transferred my credits, and now I'm a senior at a local 4-year university. Unfortunately, many of the grants and scholarships I've relied on are running out and I'm having to take out hefty student loans in order to finish off the last year of my degree. My disabilities are severe enough that I'm not capable of going to school and working at the same time, and in hopes of keeping my student loan debts down, I've turned to GoFundMe and Reddit.

**Where's the donations going?** The money I receive will go towards paying for tuition, textbooks, transportation, and living expenses while I'm attending college. The cost to finish my degree is expected to be around $20,000. I'm hoping to get enough to make up the difference from my scholarships and grants. Any funds leftover will go towards paying down my student loans.

**How can you help?** The easiest way you can help me is by donating directly to me at my  [**ABLE Savings**](http://www.sumday.com/gift/washington-able/ftoS4zYENki8j3N4f_Wkeg) account. ABLE is a federal and state-run program designed to allow disabled low-income people a chance to save money for needed expenses without losing their welfare benefits such as Social Security or SNAP food stamps. Donating directly to my ABLE account will not be counted against me when it comes to welfare services such as disability, Social Security, or Public Housing Assistance. Donations to GoFundMe also help; I do post updates on there at major points, I just posted about completing this semester *(two A's, an A-, and a B+!).* I just prefer the ABLE account because GoFundMe can be counted as income by the government and my landlady if conditions are just right.

,Asking for €500 to save my life.,"I am Margo. I am 20 years old. I suffer from severe clinical depression and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Because of this I can't go to school nor work right now. I am moving out soon into a system called 'sheltered living' in Belgium. This sytem helps people with mental health problems move out on their own, in either a cohousing system, a studio apartement or a regular apartement. I am doing this because living with my mom will no longer be an option. They offer professional psychological care as well as help you with administrative stuff and so on. I will be living off a living wage. I have little to no savings to get me up and running and could use some help. I will have to pay daily expenses, school expenses as well as medical bills and everything that comes with living alone with the little money I'll be getting monthly. I am still in recovery and right now am not allowed or able to work. Once I am healthy enough to work again I will start a student job. The people of sheltered living will be helping me with finances on the administrative side. I feel very vulnerable and emberassed starting this fundraiser but I feel like right now it's the only option.

,Hidden Disabilities Project - 2021 Animated Series,"(On mobile, apologies for format). 

Me and other students in my school who have hidden disabilities or are helping the cause, are planning to make an animated feature film that will be available on YouTube by or before April 2021. I and these other students believe that an effective way to allow others to understand what it means to have a hidden disability is for it to be seen from our perspective, in an enjoyable and digestible way - via film. We also believe that hidden disabilities aren't represented in the media very much, and when they are, it's not done in a way that's understandable or personalized. 

We are raising money in order to get adequate equipment, such as microphones, drawing tablets and music keypads. We plan to highlight all those who contribute (if they so wish). Any and all donations are highly appreciated.

Happy new year to you all! Hopefully this new decade will be 100x better for everyone! 

I am making this post to support my lovely girlfriend who is a domestic violence survivor from her past relationship. Her past abuser was a monster in every way and luckily she was able to escape and rebuild her life. After leaving him, she tried to get the authorities to bring him to justice since he was also involved in some criminal activity. She worked with a private investigator to get him behind bars where he belongs and she was told that there would be no investigation fee. Unfortunately, he abuser skipped town and the case was dropped. 

Now years later, she is being charged a ridiculous $23,000 from the private investigator... We have tried to get out of it but we are stuck... 

It is very sad that so many women in this country are abused and then left with both emotional wounds and financial burdens... This trend has to stop! Please help her out so she can once and for all cut ties to her past and continue moving forward towards a better life."

I ended up needing surgery, and for my recovery I am unable to lift my twins, as I am not allowed to lift more then 10lbs and they are 24 and 23lbs, so that means my husband has had to be off (and continue to be off) for my recovery. So we have been with out an income since the beginning of December. On December 23 we had to rush my one twin to the Er and she was diagnosed with RSV. On Christmas day we had to call an ambulance for my other twin because her fever spicked to 40.7°C (105°F), she was glazed over and moaning in pain. She was diagnosed with RSV and an ear infection. So we have spent our last available money on meds for our girls. We are now behind on bills and have nothing left for food. We are almost out of diapers, and wipes. We are absolutely desperate. Please help me provide for my family as they help me recover. Thank you and happy new year. I will post some pictures in the comments.

I created this GFM at the end of 2018 to help my best friend who is fighting cancer. There was a bit of success at the beginning but nothing for more than a year. He is truly the most wonderful and generous man, but he has lost his job, his home, and even family members because of his health. My family and I do everything we can to help - my parents bought him groceries last week - but I’m a single mom and can’t support my household as well as cover everything he needs. 
 
Any generous donations received will allow me to help him. Even small amounts can make such a difference; 
$10 can buy healthy food for dinner, 
$20 can provide a day of hospital parking, 
$50 can buy groceries for the week. 

Anything you can share would mean more than you know. Larger amounts would go a long way to paying for medication (he currently needs $300 CAD for prescriptions).

He was always healthy. Always active and had regular check-ups, until one turn of fate stole his strength, his savings, his job, his car, and his house. It stole his entire life. *It could happen to any of us*.

,"Please help me with my electricity bill! (Germany, Urgent)","(This is a repost, according to the rule of this being allowed once per week. If I misunderstood the rule, please delete this.)

Hello to you all,

Life's always ready to kick your teeth in when you least expect it. Today I got my year's end bill for electricity and as you can see in the photo I'll link to below, I owe a large sum of money.  
I'll try my best to explain, but English isn't my first language, so bear with me. Also, what I'm writing here is also all the information given in the actual gofundme link, since that one is written in German.

My home uses an old system of heating that uses electricity, and I pay for both my regular electricity and the ""heating electricity"". I try my best to be frugal with this, but I had no prior experience with the system of heating used and was unaware of the innate higher costs.

I moved into this flat towards the end of last year and because of that, my first yearly bill was actually only for around two months worth of cost. And because of that, my monthly deduction was set very low also.  
I should have questioned that, but I naively assumed that the higher deduction I was originally quoted was based on a two person household.

That was dumb of me, I know that now. I am already looking to switch to a new, cheaper provider, but that's a solution going forward, and doesn't help me right now.

I'm scared and overwhelmed and I beg you for help.

[This is a screenshot of my bill.](https://imgur.com/a/JquI44b) It's in German, the amount I owe is the above one in the red.

[This is a link to my gofundme.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/hohe-stromnachzahlung-hilfe) The bill was due on the 19th of December, so it's still very urgent.  
Please help me.

Thank you for listening."
,Help a young entrepreneur achieve his dream,"Hey Reddit, 
You’ve gotten me through pretty much everything via community support and it’s made a huge impact on who I am and what I’m doing.  It’s allowed me to get out of my shell, work towards a life I am proud of and allowed me to give back to other humans. 
I don’t have much, I’ve like many had my own stories, good and bad that have gotten me to where I am today. 
I’m proud but I need help and I think others out there will appreciate my mission. 
If you’re able to help even better. I hope to one day be on the reading end of this subreddit to be giving back to others like me. 

I’ve created a business that was originally intended to be quite cost effective and self sustaining. As with most of life it isn’t quite as easy as that to do. There’s a lot of govt red tape and legal hoops to jump through in order to have it set up to not just sustainably work but endure and grow. 
Most of my savings and life has gone into this and it’s a real thing, we’re a Canadian federal company, but it’s going to take years at this rate to get it successfully launched across Canada.  
It’s very costly to launch in each city just to provide free tours. 
I’m looking for funding to help me realize my dream of affordable, informative and fun tours of Canadian cities. 

I’ve launched in Victoria BC and am planning the Vancouver launch currently with our Toronto and Ottawa tours ideally being launched for spring. 
We create monthly events to help support our free tours but as we’re just starting, startup/launch costs in each city are more then we’re able to support and provide free tours. 
Once we have more cities launched and operational the operating cost drops and allows us to sustainably provide the free tours as the costs become a product of the city events and other tours offered. 

We provide free walking tours of Canadian cities that showcase the local hot spots, watering holes, cool history and information that backpackers, tourists and locals can all appreciate. 
Our goal is to make meeting people easier as well, we run pub crawls for people wanting to see the city and meet other like minded individuals. Less drink till you drop and more real people, meeting real people!

You can read more and check out the company and what we’re doing via the go fund me link below. 
Thanks for your time and even if you’re not able to support we appreciate any good thoughts and vibes. 
AND if you’re visiting Canada or know someone who is, don’t hesitate to reach out! 
You’ve got friends here! 

Thanks so much from the bottom of my heart!  I’m looking to change the game and help create positive change in the world. Starting one Canadian city at a time!

,In college and I need a little help paying off the rest of my rent.," So I'm currently a Junior studying Computer Science. I have taken out loans that with some scholarships have helped me pay off my tuition. Paying for Housing has had to come out of pocket. My parents were able to help me in my first two years, however due to unforeseen circumstances, they weren't able to help as much as I possibly needed. I had a summer job and also got a job during the semester and it helped pay off most of it, but coming up to the end of the year I'm $250 short. I stay on campus so since I'm late they've put my account on hold and I can't even finish registering for classes. I've contacted all campus resources only to come to no avail since it's holiday season. I maxed out my only credit card partly due to housing and I can't get a loan or another credit card since my credit score isn't the best right now. I really don't have any other family in a position that could help me right now so this is my last resort. If I don't pay soon they'll change my lock until I'm able to pay for it. It'll be a while until I get paid because my on-campus job is closed for the holiday break.

I started a gofundme page with a picture of my most recent schedule so you'll have some type of proof I'm a college student with a quick explanation as well. Here's the link: [gf.me/u/w8xahh](https://gf.me/u/w8xahh)

,Therapy fees for sexual assault,"Hello kind people of reddit. I want to ask for your help in paying my therapy fees. I was sexually assaulted when I was in college and have been struggling with PTSD and trauma ever since. The abuse took place 6 years ago and I just started going to therapy about a year ago. It is really helping, and I've been making a lot of progress, but still there is such, such a long way to go. 

Every day for the past 6 years I have been struggling with trauma, where my mind starts spinning out of control, and I cannot recover it until after its gone through its violent, haphazard turns. It was so bad that after college, when it happened, I stayed at my parents house for two years, not able to get my life together. I never told them or anyone else, except a few friends, about what happened, because it is too embarrassing and shameful. About a year and a half ago I decided to make a change and move out of my parents house and get my life together. I started looking for a job, and did lyft while I was looking. I eventually started going to therapy. The therapy sessions really helped and I formed a close bond of trust and understanding with my therapist. But it was hard to do lyft because the trauma would get really bad while I was driving. After about 6 months from starting therapy, I finally found a job, but since the therapy firm has a sliding scale fee, the fees went up when I found the job.

I am currently getting help from CalVCB, a victims of crime compensation board, but they cannot pay the entire amount, and also after about a year they will be unable to pay for my sessions any longer. My insurance is a high deductable plan, so they won't start paying for the sessions until 6 months into the year, and they can only cover half the cost after. If you could kindly donate or share my link to my gofundme page, I would truly love and appreciate it. This has been something I've been struggling with non-stop on a daily basis. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Any small help would go a long way for me.

,Disabled Airforce Veteran and Disabled (soon to be) wife Need help with Marriage/Moving Costs,"Hello! My name is Lia and my husband, Greg, and I are humbly asking for any assistance possible through a GoFundMe campaign for us to be able to afford moving costs and marriage costs. For a long time, we have both lived in a lower income neighborhood and it has only been getting worse here over time. We had been looking at homes to purchase to get away from here and found a house, in another part of the country, that was affordable in a blue collar neighborhood. My husband wanted to see if we would be eligible to get a home loan pre-approved, and he was! However, for him to afford the loan, we have to get married! (THe VA requires it.) We have been together 15 years and the one thing that has kept us from getting married beforehand was a risk of losing my medical benefits if we did. Some of the laws have changed, (unbeknownst to us,) and we found out that I will in fact not lose any benefits if I marry Greg. We will be doing a Justice of the Peace wedding, because we don't have a lot, and we don't have any family to otherwise celebrate with, just a handful of friends. We have gone ahead and made the decision to purchase the home, because we seriously fear for our lives here and just want to live somewhere safer..... but they require a good faith deposit which is $500 and a appraiser fee which is also $500. Being disabled, that is insanely difficult to put together. We will also have to figure in costs for a trailer hitch and trailer for our car. Thankfully we don't have much, but it looks like U-haul with a trailer hitch will cost about $375-400. So that burdens us even more. Not to mention the cost of gas, food, and basic travel expenses while we travel across the US. We will be moving from Colorado to Maine. I don't want to give out much more info than that due to privacy reasons, but if you need to know more just send us a PM.  According to the realtor and Lending Agent, the move would probably happen around March 1st. Thank you for taking a look and for any assistance should you decide to help! Thank you for your time.

,"Finally able to access dental care after more than a decade, cannot afford","Hello Reddit, and happy new year!  Although I suppose this isn't a very happy post, now, is it...  
I have a rare genetic mutation that causes, alongside other things, weakened teeth; I've also been on antidepressants for over a decade, and those weaken your teeth in and of themselves.

Due to finances, I haven't had access to dental care with any kind of regularity since I was eight or nine; unfortunately, this has compounded my dental issues to a degree where even the most conservative approach still means I need two teeth pulled (not counting the two I had pulled a few years ago) and almost $25,000 of work done in total.
This has been broken down into chunks based on priority by the dentist; the first bit of work totals out to almost $4,900, and the pipe dream hope is to have that money available so the work can be done before August 2020.  
  
The first chunk of money goes towards these corrections:  
Resin-based composite - three surfaces, posterior
Resin-based composite - one surface, anterior
Crown - Porcelain/ceramic substrate
All Cer Crn Seat
Endodontic therapy, bicuspid tooth (excluding final restoration)
Prefabricated post and core in addition to crown
All Cer Crn Seat
Core buildup, including any pins when required  
  
All but around six teeth in my mouth need some degree of work, and the majority of them have severe cavities; the sole financial aid I have access to IRL can cover the last ~$200 of this first chunk of payments, but it needs the other $4,650 to be there before anything can be done.

he has tried going to the public trans hospital of norway and they have ridiculed and neglected him, so he sought treatment at a private hospital. the price listed in the link is an estimate, but a more exact one will be known on january 8. (the estimate being kr41,000, or about $4,700 USD.)

I'm reposting this from r/Charity to hopefully get more eyes.

My name is Joseph Ramirez, and I'm 24 years old living in North Dakota. I recently was hired on to a new job, and made the mistake of leaving my old job too quickly. My previous employment was stressful and unpleasant, and after landing my much better position I was very eager to leave. I had money saved up but I overestimated how much, and now I am in desperate need of help making my rent for the month of January.

I don't start my new job until the 6th of January and I likely won't receive a paycheck until mid-to-late Jan, and by that point I'll be facing eviction. Right now, all I need is $550 to make my rent for the month of January. I can push back most of my other bills to after my first paycheck, but my complex is ruthless about making rent on time. I've tried asking friends (I'm estranged from my family) but everyone I know is broke for one reason or another, and with my credit score is in the toilet (see the estranged from my family line for a hint as to why) I've been rejected for multiple loans. I'm out of options, so Reddit is my hail mary. I've been through numerous evictions growing up, and I'm terrified of being put in that position again.

Anything you can spare to help me would be appreciated. I know I made a mistake, but I don't know what else to do to fix it.

,Help With Business Neighbor's Power Bill,"I run a small business and I share a building with 2 other businesses.  There is only one meter for the power and water bills, and I handle and pay all the bills and we split the costs between the businesses based on usage.  


2 of the businesses (including mine) are pretty unique to our area so I don't want to provide specifics and highlight the third business that I'm trying to help; I don't want to embarrass them.  


The third business is a photography studio. They're relatively successful, but if you're a photographer, you'll understand that photography clients don't always pay punctually.  


Because of that, it's been difficult sometimes for them to keep up with the power bill. I have been able to cover their costs and the photography studio tries to pay off a few months as budget allows it. They don't forget their bills, and they will tell me when a good contract is landed and they pay off a few months of the electric bill.  


I want to try to help them out and with their outstanding electric bills before it becomes too great for them to overcome.  


I don't mean to try to enable them into not paying bills, because they do. They are good neighbors and they work very hard in a competitive business. I just want to give them a helping hand just once before the bills become too much and they can get back to the point of maintaining it.  


Their total outstanding bills is just under $650, so it's not exuberant, but large enough to keep them in a hole.

I know that compared to so many of the posts here my problems aren't nearly as bad, my life isn't being threatened, I just want to be happy, I suppose. Ever since I was still in elementary school, I've been obsessed with language. It's my passion, I just love finding new ways to communicate with people; may that be through verbally speaking with them or even sign language. I've always dreamt of immersing myself in another language and culture, but it always seemed like it could only ever be just that, a dream. Recently I met someone who actually has studied abroad, and it made realize that the only reason my dream is just a dream, is because I'm not doing anything to make it real. So, I started working. I've been earning money for a few months now, but I know I'm still now going to be able to afford it all by the deadline. I'm trying to be totally set to go by August 2020, which means having the money far before that point.

,End stage renal / CIDP patient seeking help.,"Hello, My name is Joey. I'm diagnosed with end stage renal failure, a rare disorder called CIDP neuropathy, diabetes, CKD anemia, sleep apnea, heart disease, peripheral artery disease, and hypertension. In the beginning of 2019 I was diagnosed with a rare infection that’s in the same family of tuberculosis called mycobacterium abscessus. A nasty infection that almost killed me. I had to be on strong daily IV antibiotics for 4 months and I am still on pill antibiotics until the end of January. This infection knocked me inactive on the transplant list. I have to wait at least 4 more months before I am considered again. I've had a heart attack which led to 3 stents in my heart. I've almost died multiple times due to my illnesses. I take a lot of medication and I have dialysis 3 times a week.

My pup recently had surgery and we owe the vet over one thousand dollars. She had her enlarged spleen taken out. Thankfully, it wasn't cancer.  She is doing great now and back to her old self but we need to start paying the bill in a few weeks.

I had to sell a few things of mine just to pay bills and get medicine. I sold my drum kit and a bunch of my old consoles from my collection. Wife and I lost our car and recently lost our house due to piling bills. We found a new place with my parents so we could split all bills down the middle. It will help us out big time but it'll take 3 to 4 months to catch up.

As you might be able to tell this takes a lot out of me and my wife. She is the only one working while I am on disability. We got to the point where we were comfortable with our finances but the infection at the beginning of the year killed us. Donations will go towards medical bills, medicines, vet bill and food.

Hi, my name is Nicole and I'm 18 years old. 4 months ago (August) i found a painless lump on my right armpit and until now its still here. It got bigger and the all symptoms that i feel for the past 4 months got worst. I didn't have a chance to go to the doctor again due to financial problem. 

On the first week of october, i feel a lump on my neck and it was a pea size and the lump on my armpit got bigger also. I called the doctor and he said that i really need to get a lab tests to determine my condition and we need to prepare a large amount of money for all the medical tests and for the possible surgery. The doctor said my case was rare and its a immediate medical care. I don't have health insurance and here in the philippines we don't have foundation that will help you with your medical test bill. We also talked to our government to ask for help but they said they can't help me due to the limited funds. I really got no choice but to create this fundraising to have a money for my medical tests.

Please help me and my family. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

,My boyfriends mother has tumors and needs surgery.,"My boyfriend and I live together and have been just barely getting by financially, especially with the holidays recently we aren't in the best spot. We are in the process of obtaining citizenship for his mother because she lives in Brasil still, while he had moved back to the US. It has been a while since he has seen her so this news is discouraging. We had learned within the last week or so that his mom has uterine tumors that are benign, but they are causing internal bleeding and she will need surgery to have them taken out. The cost for the surgery is 5200 reais or about 1,300 US dollars, and his mother does not have the money for it so we would like to help her out. Anything will be greatly appreciated.

,Help with Immigration Expenses,"My family and I are asking for help with immigration expenses for my brother in law, Hugo. He is a Peruvian who has been married to my sister for over 8 years. They have two beautiful children together and another one on the way. Both my sister’s family and most of Hugo’s family live in the United States. It has been really hard for them to live so far away from family for so long. Hugo has not been able to visit the United States since before they were married, so only friends and family members who have been able to fly to Peru have been able to meet him. 

On the rare occasions when my sister and the kids have been able to come to visit the US, my sister has had to travel over 24 hours alone with the kids, and Hugo has had to be separated from his family for the duration of their stay. This is really hard on my sister, Hugo, and the kids.

This situation has also been really hard on the family in the US who have only been able to have short visits with Hugo, Amy, and the kids. We try to keep in touch as much as possible through FaceTime, but it is just not the same as in person and it is heartbreaking when the kids hug and kiss the iPad because they miss us. 

Hugo is pursuing immigration, but it is a very difficult and expensive process. We are helping as much as we can, but we could use help with paying for the immigration lawyers. If anyone is able to help it would be greatly appreciated. Anything at all helps. 

More importantly, we would ask for your prayers that Hugo would find favor with the government and that they would approve his immigration application.

,Making a difference in Sharon Caron's life,"So I have never done one of these before but my dad and I created a gofundme for one of our neighbors \[ with their permission \] to try and help raise money for medical expenses and such.The full story is on the page but a little overview.  Sharon was like a second mother to me, constantly looking over my sister and I when our parents were out of town or when we were hanging out with their son \[ my friend \] and daughter.  We live in a small town and an even smaller neighborhood and we were all very close growing up.  A couple years ago Sharon started having trouble with walking and it has progressed with increasing speed every month.  Now she has had to retire from work and cant get herself out of bed because she does not have enough strength in order to do so.The purpose of this campaign is to raise money so that Steve and Sharon can keep their heads above water while they fight this cruel fight.  She was diagnosed with Primary Lateral Sclerosis \[ PLS \] which is a rare neuromuscular disease that weakens your muscles.  Steve is trying to go to work and keep his job but is finding it increasingly difficult because of the state that Sharon is in, and now they need in-home care.

All money from the gofundme will go to helping Steve keep up with medical bills and in-home care for Sharon.

Whether it is monetary or just sharing to friends we would all greatly appreciate your help and support with this gofundme.  Thank you all for taking the time to read.

,My mom is about to lose her house to foreclosure! Please help my family! I am desperate!!!,"Like the title says, I am desperate.  I have tried posting to r/Assistance but my post did not get much attention. 

Reddit, My name is Erin, and I don't know what else to do. I'm hoping for a miracle.....can you help me?

My mom is one of the hardest working people I know but most employers aren't looking for 62 year old candidates. She currently works full time at a storage facility but the pay just doesn't cover all the bills.  I've helped her submit countless resumes and applications but she has yet to hear back from anyone. When payday finally arrives she has to play financial triage and unfortunately the mortgage payment took a backseat to gas/electricity and food. Now she's in dire straits and is about to lose the house to foreclosure. 

The house has been in the family since her parents had it built in 1963. This is the house she grew up in. The house I grew up in too (my parents divorced when I was young).  She bought the house from her family estate after her mother passed away in 2014.  When she bought the house she was employed at the local mall as the Assistant Mall manager. She was earning much higher wages and paying the mortgage was no problem. Unfortunately she was laid off in 2016 when her employer eliminated her position.  In order to receive her meager severance package and unemployment benefits she had to sign a disclosure agreement that she waived her rights to sue the company over her termination.  She was unemployed for 5 months and took the first job she was offered at a local storage facility. She works her ass off and is not compensated properly for her hard work, but like I said no one else is hiring her, so she's stuck.

I live with my boyfriend and I'm just getting by myself and am not in a position where I can financially help her yet. I'm a student in community college (always the oldest in the class!) working toward my associates degree with a double major in biology and chemistry.  I work part time in the microbiology lab at my school preparing the supplies for the students to use in the laboratory.

I'm begging, literally, begging, please, Reddit, help my family. I don't know what I can do in return other than offer my thanks and gratitude to anyone who can donate or even just share my moms story and maybe help her find a better job!

I'm almost healed and about ready to get back to work. However, that money won't come soon enough.

I have a $500 deductible and that's all I'm really asking for as I'm sure I can make it by with everything else, but reaching my goal would be fantastic to alleviate things. 



Link to my gofundme for my car- https://www.gofundme.com/f/1uq2macsao



I'm not asking for help with this (below) as my go fund me is for my current immediate needs of paying my deductible and whatever else going to paying my friend for gas for helping me get to work and for bus fare for when I can't get a ride (rather not take a bus as I'd be incredibly limited on hours and it takes twice as long to get to work/home than it does when driving). Then also to paying the gas and electric bill since I will be having my hours reduced for about a month. (Explanation of everything in gofundme). I'm just including these here as I said it's just one thing on top of another and getting help right now with my deductible would be an incredible relief to me and I'd be so grateful for the help.



My cat needs to have a canine pulled because it is chipped and I would rather have it pulled now (well, as soon as possible) than when it actually becomes a problem because that's when it will be more expensive as it will be an urgent matter over a recommended matter. That will be anywhere between $200 and $350, depending on how difficult the extraction is. They believe it will be on the low end though.



I also think I felt a lump on the side of my cat on Christmas Eve and she hasn't been acting herself lately so I'm taking her to the vet to get checked out. I'm really hoping I just felt something that seemed abnormal but is actually normal. Or if not, it's something that is minor as I have my cat as an emotional support animal and I really don't know what I would do if something was wrong with her because I can't afford treatment. But one step at a time for now. Can't get myself worried over the unknown with her.



I'm also trying to go back to school and it's going to cost $1,800 for the semester. I'm taking classes that go along with the nursing degree (ASN) so when I apply for the school, all I will have to take are the nursing courses so I don't have an overloaded schedule."
,Please help a single mother with chronic illness," this GofundMe for my daughter Kristin, she is an incredibly strong single mother who works two jobs and would never ask anyone for help. I’ve unfortunately watched her health declining for some time now; as she puts on her game face everyday and pushes through the chronic pain she lives with.  After many trips to the hospital in the last year with extreme exhaustion and adrenal fatigue, so many tests, they found she has an autoimmune disease and her Doctor is recommending that she take some time to rest and eliminate stress to focus on her health and healing.  

Unfortunately, Kristin is single, self-supporting and cannot afford to take the time off to get well so she is caught in a vicious circle as she must work to pay bills  but the stress of working is taking a toll and adding to her health issues. It’s heartbreaking to see her in survival mode trying to do this alone, and to see her suffer so much in pain.

So I’m asking for any help to pay her bills for two months and help pay for the treatments, medications and supplements prescribed. The supplements alone are around $200 every 2-3 weeks and that’s not including the treatments she needs.

I will help her as much as I can but it’s just not enough. Two months off will allow her to spend some time focusing on her health, she’d be able to receive the treatments she needs and allow her body to rest and heal. This has been difficult as a mother to witness, as I feel very helpless. So I’m hoping this will eliminate some stress and give her a reprieve from the struggles so she can finally get better. She is such a beautiful compassionate gentle soul and deserves to have a healthy happy normal life. 

Thank you in advance for any amount you can donate. If you cannot offer financial help, please share this and prayers are also appreciated. She is number one on my prayer list and prayer changes things. Two months of expenses including treatments has a goal of $5000.

,"My grandparents have lost everything they own to a house fire, for the second time in their lives.","I’m mostly a lurker here on reddit. I don’t really know if this is a relevant subreddit, but I’ll let the mods be the judge of that. Now for some background:

My grandparents on my fathers side are good people really, they have their faults of course, but beyond that, they are only human you know?  They are very southern, somewhat backwoods and have never had much to their names. My grandfather used to build houses for a living, and consequently, bought a plot of land years ago and built his own house. When I was very young, probably 7 or 8, the house he had built with his hard work burned to the ground. No insurance, no anything. The local community banded together and helped them with food, clothing and money. They eventually were able to buy a trailer to put on the same plot of land, and have lived there since then, keeping to themselves in an honestly very impoverished but manageable lifestyle. That all changed this Christmas. 

In the middle of the night on Christmas evening they awoke to flames, likely due to an electrical fire and lost everything, yet again. They are well into their 70s now and just need a place to live out the remainder of their lives. The local community and church is helping yet again, but I thought I would try to contribute through social media and reddit, as they can be powerful tools to help people. They aren’t asking for a lot, and really anything you can spare will help them immensely. 

Here is the go fund me my aunt has set up. Thank you in advance if you contribute, they really don’t have much to their name.

,My best friend's 5 year old son is unexpectedly going blind after realizing his vision issues were misdiagnosed 4 years ago. Please help this family and the unexpected costs that come with this.,"Hello!

My best friend's 5-year old son, David, was misdiagnosed when he was 9 months old with Hyperopia (far-sightedness) and Congenital Nystagmus (Uncontrollable shaking of the eyes)

Earlier this year, they flew David to a specialist in California (we live in Minnesota) to help fix his Nystagmus. They received the news that David does not have Nystagmus and was misdiagnosed when he was an infant. The shaking of his eyes is a side effect of a serious, progressive eye condition called Retinal Dystrophy, which results in blindness.

It took them 5 months of visiting specialists and having tests and procedures performed to receive a proper diagnosis for David. He has Leber Congenital Amaurosis (a form of Retinal Dystrophy) caused by a rare genetic mutation (CRB1 gene). 

There is currently no approved treatment for this diagnosis, and they don't know how quickly he'll lose his vision. His vision loss is already progressing, though.

It starts by taking away his peripheral vision, which he already has lost. Next, he'll lose the ability to see colors. Recently, he stopped being able to see the color blue. Finally, his central vision will be lost.

All in the midst of this, David's mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and is currently undergoing treatment for it.
Her main concern continues to be David and wanting to help him in any way that she can.

They have a large amount of debt due to medical bills, and also have to make their house more accessible for David as he loses his vision.

,I'll be kicked out of school if i don't pay December's bill.,"Right now I'm in a tough financial situation, I didn't expect to come asking for money here, but it turns out,2 months ago I was looking for work to pay for my course, I only got work at the beginning of December, I missed a school fee for the first time (November), the school agreed to postpone to end of December but it would be the last time .

When I got the job in December, they promised 3 € per hour with a workload of 25 hours per week. It was 3 € because the first month was training, since I started day 2, I was supposed to receive 100 € (salary).

But it turns out that this Friday 27th, they called me to say that I was not admitted and that was stipulated in the contract that if not admitted would receive 50% of the value.

So at this moment I am in a precarious situation, I will receive 50 € at the end of the month, which will be to pay the monthly payment of November, and I still have to pay the monthly payment of December (this month).

They gave me until January 6th to pay, otherwise I will be expelled from school and will have to repeat the course (2 years lost).

Please help us attend her funeral, and help his father.","On Christmas Eve (two days away from his birthday on the 26th) my husband received a message informing him that his family home had burned down, and that his mother did not make it out of the fire.

My husband is a Japanese citizen who has made his home in Wichita, Kansas. His family, and the remains of his family's home, is located in Asahikawa, Japan.

This past year has, unfortunately, been one tragedy after another and our bank account can barely cover the inflated costs of air travel at this time of year. Round-trip flights from Wichita to Asahikawa are $2,500-$3,000 a piece. So I've set up this GoFundMe to cover the basic costs of air travel for the two of us, so that we can use all of our own money to help his father.

We would be humbled beyond all words and gestures for any help in this extremely grave and trying time.

Hello there:    


My name is Sydney.  I'm a wife, and a mother, heading up a small family of four that cannot seem to escape the crisis in which we find ourselves.    


I have a treatable, but not curable genetic, auto-inflammatory condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa (Stage 3).  You can research it, but in simple terms, it's a condition that causes large, painful, non-healing abscesses and lesions across all parts of the body that houses apocrine sweat glands (under arms, over thighs, genitals, buttocks, down legs, etc).  At Stage 3, tracts form under the skin, in thick, rope-like formations that travel between the abscesses.    


To say that this condition isn't a pleasure to live with would be the understatement of the century.  Every day is spent in a constant agony that I cannot begin to describe, and because of the extremely painful nature of H.S., I cannot work, or properly care for my young children, (ages 1 and 2).    


I am currently undergoing treatment that should, in time, render me more able to at least make myself useful around the house, and a better part of our children's care, and would also enable us to find adequate work.  That said, recovery and management is an incredibly long road ahead of us (estimated to be about 6-7 months in total for this treatment to be completed), and therefore, we need help to make ends meet with our healthcare and living expenses, which run around $1.500 per month.    


Up until now, we've been relying on my meager earnings as a 3D Animator (the only real work that I'm capable of doing, as it only requires me to use a computer from home), and assistance from family.  This situation is putting an incredible strain on those relationships, and we fear that by the time our situation finally straightens out, we will have damaged all associations we have beyond repair.    


We'd like our children to be able to grow up having those relationships intact, and thus, we are turning to fundraising as a last resort to help keep us afloat until we can find our way back out of the woods.     


We are perfectly happy to provide any and all documentation of our situation, our bills, and my condition should it be required for acquiring any sort of assistance we may receive.    


If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading our story, and thank you in advance for any help you may be able to provide, or even for sharing our story with your friends.    


Much Love,

,The Von Oeson Family Needs A Miracle This New Year,"Jon(pictured bottom, right)is a young man from Brick Township, New Jersey. He works at the Wawa convenience store off of Drum Point Road. Less than a week ago, tragedy struck when an 86 year old man lost control of his pickup, and plowed into the side of Jon's house, and through his side wall, killing his mother, 55, asleep in her bed. This family is currently struggling to relocate and bury their beloved mother.

Attached is an article pertaining to the incident, and a gofundme if anyone would like to aid this brave family in their time of need.

,Alvin’s medical bills,"Alvin is our 11 year old son who has neurofibromatosis Type 1. Over the last year, he has had recurrent headaches, varying in severity. At his yearly checkup with the neurologist on August 8th, we mentioned this to her, and she prescribed him medication for migraines along with scheduling him for MRIs, just to make sure it was migraines and nothing more.

Alvin had his MRI performed on September 3rd. On September 7th, his neurologist called us with the results of the MRIs. While they did see the typical abnormalities one can expect with NF, they also found a 1.2 cm ""lesion"" in his right frontal cortex that had not been seen previously onprevious MRIs. (NF kids tend to get MRIs a lot). They suspected a glioma (tumor) or a focus of cortical dysplasia. (basically, a malformation of the brain responsible for later onset irretractable epilepsy) We were now to meet with the neurosurgeon on Sept 10th to talk about our next steps.

On September 10th, we met with the neurosurgeon. He, along with his colleagues do NOT believe whatever this is is NF related. The neurosurgeon is leaning more towards it being a glioma than dysplasia. Rather than do a biopsy, the team decided to repeat the MRIs in December to look for growth. We had the MRI repeated on December 9th. They didn’t notice any growth, so they decided to check the MRI again in March. Come March, If it has grown, then it will be assumed to be a glioma (tumor) rather than the dysplasia (malformation). If it has not grown, it doesn't rule out a glioma, nor confirm dysplasia.

In the interim, we have to monitor Alvin for changes in personality, behavior, and other changes. We have to monitor his headaches, and keep a log of the intensity, duration, frequency, etc. In the last few months, Alvin has had to come home from school several times due to these headaches.

Unfortunately, this is all costing us a fortune. While we were blessed to have a decent insurance plan, our copays on this are astronomical. We have already wracked up close to $6000 in copays and are looking at $10,000+ medical costs in the next few months between medication, MRIs, and appointment copays, and misc medical costs (anesthesia, etc)

We are asking for help in paying for this. We cannot afford this ourselves. Alternatively, our financial advisor for the hospital is willing to take direct payment, if desired. Information on that can be given, if requested.

,"Assist a flood victim with getting a new home (only need a little help, already have a grant).","I'm going to keep this short but you can PM me or message Shannon directly on Facebook (she doesn't even know about reddit) if you have any more questions.  I know the gofundme page is a wreck but a well meaning person made it but they aren't too computer savvy.  If it's too much there is a TL:DR at the bottom.

Shannon Ritter is in dire straights after the [historic Louisiana floods of 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Louisiana_floods) damaged her home.  Shannon is on disability as she was born with [CMT](https://www.cmtausa.org/understanding-cmt/what-is-cmt/) and it has progressed to the point she can no longer work.  Shannon has always been a fighter so she went through all the programs/assistance steps she can think of and FINALLY got approved for the restore LA grant (great news!).  Someone is actually gifting her a new piece of land to put the new mobile home on that is not in a flood zone (even better news).  Unfortunately the grant program is shutting down in early 2020 and her grant offer expires on the 15th of January (see the letter [here](https://i.imgur.com/foHG2IH.jpg)).  The grant is not enough to cover a new mobile home (much less moving, the setup, etc etc) so she had a friend start a go fund me page.  I know it is a lot to ask but if you guys/gals can help out someone who has fallen between the cracks I would greatly appreciate it.  If you have any ideas of help outside of gofundme me please reply below (or PM if you prefer).  If you want to read about her current living conditions you can check out her [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/shannon.ritter.148).  If somehow the gofundme goes over Shannon is going to use the extra money to replace belongings (she can't bring anything to the new place because of mold spores).  Thanks for reading.

TL:DR:  Friend got flooded, got approved for a grant to get herself a new place but the grant doesn't cover the entire cost and the grant is [use it or lose it by January 15th](https://i.imgur.com/foHG2IH.jpg)  so she needs help with the difference.

,Our dog Barret needed emergency intestine surgery for mesenteric torsion - three weeks after our other dog Penny finished her chemo. It's been a ruff year..,"The past few days have been pretty rough even though it was Christmas - on Monday the 23rd our one year old rescue Barret had mesenteric torsion which is when a dog's intestines twist and die, so that night/early Tuesday he went into emergency surgery. Most dogs do not live when this happens because the surgery must be performed asap, and even then the prognosis is up in the air due to complications, sepsis, etc... Somehow he had trooped through and came home Wednesday and has since been resting all day, eating and drinking and even wagging his tail from time to time. I've slept on the floor the past three nights with him (slept being a poor choice of diction as I more or less dozed for the past three days). Needless to say I'm pretty exhausted myself.

My fiancee and I decided to launch a GoFundMe because of all that has happened this year. On July 1st our 6 year old Penny was diagnosed with lymphoma - she went through four cycles before finally completing on December 9th. She is now back to her old self albeit a little skinnier, barking and playing and just being super loveable. With Penny's chemo, and now including this unexpected surgery, our vet bills for the year easily total over $10,000. Although we make a decent combined income, this has hit us really hard financially as we were practically faced with the ultimatum at the vet of either going for the surgery (with odds against)... or euthanasia. Being that he just turned 1 in November, we took a gamble and elected for the surgery. For dog parent's like us, I would highly recommend pet insurance - it would've saved us thousands. We've since learned our lesson.

Here's a photo of the two (Barret is the black lab/shepherd mix): https://m.imgur.com/a/zes1eiK

If you can help donate or help get this post attention, we would greatly appreciate it. Even words of support would be great. Even an updoot.

,"Traumatic Saw Injury Results in permanent amputation & +$20,000 of Debt: Patient Wishes to Pay Off Debt & ""Pay It Forward"" By Becoming Certified to Teach and Inspire Underprivileged Children Post Accident","[http://gf.me/u/vzdp9n](http://gf.me/u/vzdp9n)

On November 26th 2018, I had suffered a traumatic saw injury resulting in the permanent amputation of my small finger as well as the severing of my ring, middle and pointer fingers: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalGore/comments/egksei/saw\_accident\_results\_in\_amputation\_open\_fracture/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalGore/comments/egksei/saw_accident_results_in_amputation_open_fracture/)

So far, I've had 4 re-constructive surgeries (Nov'18, Feb'19, Apr'19, Dec'19) & have been told that I will need additional surgeries throughout the rest of my life to maintain function (ie: joint replacements/mcp arthroplasty & additional scar tissue removal/tenolysis & capsulotomy). 

In the time since my accident, I have been laid off from work (April 2019) and unable to find a comparable replacement job. I have since started working on an hourly/part-time basis with my occupational therapist, but I am lucky if I see a bi-weekly paycheck over $200. I am hoping to start driving for Uber/Lyft as well to try and be as diligent with paying this debt off as possible. 

To any and all whom choose to help, I can't thank you enough & will make it a point to pay the kindness forward: Once I am able - it is my hope to teach, inspire and empower children that otherwise wouldn't be able to afford or attend school. After spending 6 years in Sales, I have decided it will be best to use my interpersonal skills to motivate, inspire and empower children. Much of the sales skills I have  learned, ie: identifying customer needs, providing solutions to problems - can be applied to teaching. 

After I am able to pay off most of my debt, it is my hope to get certified to teach english and teach abroad through the TEFL or CIEE program, working with impoverished children in South America.

Before my accident, my sister and I had the privilege of traveling through Colombia in Summer of 2017. On our way to hike through the Tayrona National Forest, she and I witnessed an incredible sight: children with nothing but a mud floor, thatch roof and deflated soccer ball... even still they had the widest and purest smiles I had seen in a long time. They had sheer rags for clothing & what most wouldn’t even consider a live-able house but these kids were grateful for life itself.

These are the exact kind of kids I want to work with!

Once I garner experience teaching abroad, it is my hope to return to the US to pursue a masters in Educational Reform while having the potential to work along side the UW-Madison Odyssey Project. ""The Odyssey project takes a whole family approach to breaking the cycle of generational poverty through access to education, giving adult and youth learners a voice, and increasing confidence through reading, writing, and speaking.""

,Best Friend Family Died In Car Crash,"The best friend I have, Athena, she is so kind and sweet, selfless. Her family had just had a car accident with a reckless driver. Her cousins Destiny and Emilio are in the hospital. Emilio could be paralyzed and Destiny is currently in the hospital with broken bones and burns, in a coma. Her mother Amanda, grandma Donna, and another cousin Layla who was four died. Poor Destiny is only 10 and dealing with the losses after she wakes up will be hard for her. Amanda was 29 and Donna was 48. Emilio is 17, just a kid and is losing his ability to walk. He has his whole life ahead of him. My friend Athena and her family is dealing with these losses. The fundraiser is to pay for funeral cost and extra is going to hospital costs for Destiny and Emilio.

Layla didn’t need to die, Donna didn’t need to die, Amanda with her 2 children, didn’t need to die. Destiny and Emilio didn’t need to go through this. Athenas family doesn’t need this. Think before you drive drunk or recklessly. You may cause another situation like this to occur. More Destiny’s, Emilio’s, Athena’s, Layla’s. Do YOU want to cause the death of a little girls family? Destiny is in a COMA, she is on the BRINK of death. I knew this girl. She was sweet and energetic, always bouncing with energy. Her smile was so kind. She was brave too, she will pull through, that brave little girl. I didn’t know Layla, but she was FOUR, she didn’t deserve to die. None of these people deserved to die. This kind and thoughtful family didn’t deserve this. Athena’s dad has gone through 2 accidents already, and now the loss of his sister and her family.

,"We lost our son, my husband was diagnosed with cancer, lost his job and we need your help.","We are Mark and Vicki Witbeck and we have been blessed with 6 children.  From left to right (back row) is Paul (26), Jake (20), Shane (23), Mark (dad) and Mark (19).  My wife, Vicki, is in front with our daughter, Sara Kate (11) and son, Craig (22).  3 of our children (Craig, Jake & Sara Kate) have special needs.  Over the years, Jake's health declined the most. He was diagnosed as an infant with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.  NF1 is a neurological disorder, affecting about one in every 3,000 people. NF1 ranges from mild to severe, and can cause more symptoms in some people than in others. It primarily affects the skin, the nervous system and the eyes.  Jake started experiencing severe symptoms when he was 12 and by age 15 we found out that he had an inoperable brain tumor on his brain stem.  Since 2014, Jake has undergone multiple brain surgeries, suffered immense pain, developed severe scoliosis and had to have a tracheotomy and a feeding tube placed in 2016.  For 2 years, Jake improved enough to have the trache removed, which he was so happy about.  Jake understood the risks, as the trache is what had kept him alive, but he felt secure in his faith in God and that whatever time he had in this life, he would cherish.  As his family we have watched his health slowly decline and in September of 2019, he was diagnosed with pleurisy.  Within weeks he developed pneumonia, his kidneys failed, and he passed away on October 19, 2019. This has devastated our family in ways that words cannot describe.  In 2019, our family has been suffering from every angle possible.  Sara Kate has had several Sickle Cell crisis events as well as an emergency shunt revision surgery. Her pain gets worse with every crisis.  Craig has Cerebral Palsy and is on the severe end of the spectrum.  Craig requires 100% care, cannot talk and suffers from incontinence.  Paul, Shane and Mark have helped their brothers and sister with complete love and acceptance.  They are all suffering greatly from losing Jake.  In February 2019, Vicki was diagnosed with PTSD, which she has suffered with for many years, not knowing what it was.  Another devastating loss we have experienced is when Mark's employment ended (without warning or any severance) in June, 2019.  And most recently, on October 28, just 9 days after Jake's passing, Mark had a Radical Orchiectomy for testicular cancer.  The pathology results confirmed his cancer is malignant.  This has caused Mark's search for employment to be on hold.  Our family is in crisis mode.  Due to so many devastating situations, our family savings is being depleted.  We need funds immediately, if possible.  These funds will be used to help our family get back on our feet.  We have lost so much that money cannot provide relief for, but it will help us recover from this year of personal devastation.   [Witbeck Family Relief Fund](https://www.gofundme.com/f/markwitbeckfamilyrelieffund?sharetype=teams&member=1234852&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&rcid=b41dc16c8d6141b4837bcf7f1b486d4e)"
,A veteran and his family,"My best friend knows my struggles lately and took it upon himself to create a gofundme for my family and our current struggles.

As the title says, I am a veteran, I'm also disabled with my neck, shoulders and upper back suffering from muscle spasms, nerve pain and early onset of degenerative arthritis due to an injury suffered in basic training. I've put it all on the line for this country and in turn, I'm getting shafted by the VA. I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD and extreme depression with suicidal tendencies/thoughts. The VA is naturally taking their time in approving my disability and paying me. In the meantime, bill collectors don't care about your troubles. My wife is currently struggling with back injuries from a past car crash and recurring mental problems from past trauma. 

Due to my injuries, she is the only worker in the household and we barely scrape by. It has gotten to the point of us taking out multiple credit cards just to cover basic needs. If not for my buddy helping us in the past, I'm positive we would be homeless right now.

I know money is tight for everyone, especially this time of year. All I'm asking is to please look and if you can spare a buck or two, every little bit helps us. A share is free and even that small gesture is greatly appreciated.

From my family to all of yours, have a safe and happy new year.

I don’t really know how to start this, but I’m in desperate need of some help. 

This summer, I was kicked out my house by my legal guardians and was left with little money because half of my savings were taken from my account by my parents. I worked the entire summer to save for the Fall semester, however have nothing left. I tried getting a job during the school year, but there wasn’t anything available on campus, and I don’t have a car nor the funds to pay for Ubers back and forth. 

Now I’m on winter break and preparing to return for my Spring semester. I have a phone bill to pay off monthly since I was taken off my parents’ phone bill and also have a hefty textbook price tag coming up. I currently have enough money to pay my phone bill for one more month, but will have no where near enough for school expenses at the start of this semester. If anyone could help me out, I’d really appreciate it. I don’t have family members to ask for help and really don’t have any other options (already taking $10k in loans a year for tuition). 

Anything helps guys, even just a quick share would be super appreciated. Life is tough right now and don’t know if I’ll even be able to continue with school as of right now.

,My girlfriend has struggled all her life because all she does is help other people before she helps herself. Im looking to try and help her go to college.,"My girlfriend is an amazing woman all around. She turns 18 in just a few short months and leaves to college a few months after that. Her family and her have been struggling with money for her entire life and she might not be able to go to college because of it.
     To elaborate, my girlfriend, from a young age, has been taking care of her nieces and nephews because their parents couldn’t. She has had to scavenge for food and has had to sleep on a neighbors trampoline many times because of them. She has always given them first picks when it came to food and just recently has been able to pay for food that they can eat. She gets paid $0.25 more than minimum wage and works as many hours as her manager allows her to. She has been saving up for her college fund since sophomore year, but just recently her mother has started to steal her money. She had a total of $5,000 saved up but now she is down to $2,000. Her college tuition, for two semesters, is around $15,000 and she has gotten only $3,000 each semester in scholarships. She has come to me in tears multiple times because she is afraid she might not be able to go to college and achieve her dream of becoming a music therapist and helping people. She has given everything for herself up to please her family, and now she has nearly nothing. My wish is to be able to help her out and send her to college, even if it means talking my manager into giving me overtime without overtime pay. She deserves everything from me and i have given her everything i can. I just hope to be able to send her to college in the end of it all. Please, anyone out there that can find it in their heart to donate, please help me send this blessing of a woman to college. Thank you for anyone that has read this, and a special thank you for anyone that ends up donating ❤️

,"About to lose electricity, which means losing everything","Hey all,

I just got hit with a serious electricity bill that I have no way to pay. Somehow, it came out to $759. How it did this, I'll never know, but I've tried (and failed) to negotiate with the electric company about it. The point is, I'm stuck with this bill and the worst part is that this bill, left unpaid, will have a serious downward spiral effect on my wife, son, two daughters and I.

If I can't get this paid, my wife and I can't work. Both of us work from home using an internet connection (I do remote troubleshooting and she is a teacher) and if we lose our electricity, we both lose our jobs, which spirals into losing our house and from there, we literally have nowhere else to go, not even with family as none of either of our family members have room for a five person family. I could have paid this electric bill on my own if it were a reasonable price like usual but this? There's no way.

I've posted screenshots of my electricity bill on the GoFundMe page as proof but I will submit any further proof needed if you'd like. Thank you in advance.

,Help me celebrate sobriety through Lucha Libre!,"Hi everyone!

6 years ago, I made a promise to my partner & her kids that I would stop drinking alcohol, as it made me a really crappy person to be around. I drank too much and my health suffered among other things. after about 4 years, I took to a daily yoga routine to lose weight and slowly started adding more conventional exercises in there too. 

Dusring all this hooplah, My wife and I moved from Florida to Atlanta. as a 90s kid, I always assocaited Atlanta with WCW and NWA pro wrestling, so I found some indy wrestling shows in person and online. But once I was able to attend a local Mexican Lucha Libre promotion, I thought I'd give it a try. I'm a comic book fan, and who doesn't want to be a superhero or supervillain?

Luckily, Atlanta has a few wrestling schools in the area, and I've been looking into training in order to learn Lucha Libre. For me, it's a great combination of Superhero stories, physical fitness, and showing people that when you mess up, you get right back up and keep moving forward.

I'd really appreciate any help with this endeavour, as I need some help raising money for tuition for the school, so that I can participate in this very athletic theatre without hurting myself or others (at least not TOO badly anyway) and I'd love to use this as a platform to promote clean and sober living if I can. My gofundme page can be found [here](https://gf.me/u/wumqmd). Any help (financial or otherwise) is greatly appreciated!

,Stage 4 cancer. Please help my brother in law and his family.,"https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-morris-fight-cancer

My brother in law has stage 4 colon cancer. He’s been doing chemo for months. He has four children and he’s a great father. Anything will help thank you!"
,Fund Autistic Starcrossed Lovers' Unlikely Reunion," I am here to seek your aid in my quest to reunite with a hip and lovely ray of sunshine I've long wanted to spend a life with. I call her Kitty - a picture of her is on the [gofundme page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/fund-autistic-starcrossed-lovers039-unlikely-reunion), and I am happy to provide any verification requested. Kind words are also very much accepted in lieu of donations. :)  


Kitty and I were great friends in college almost ten years ago. We had most of our classes together, and always felt at home in each other's company - strikingly so. A powerful but quiet connection formed, and we've stayed in contact in little ways since we parted paths all those years ago.   


It wasn't until only recently that she shared her feelings, and I shared mine. In my mind, much time was wasted. But this is as the Fates would have it. The challenge that besets is geographical; she lives 700 miles away. Money raised by the fundraiser will help pay for my expenses to go start a life with her there.  


What I am asking for is a risk, but to pass it by would leave the taste of regret in my mouth for a lifetime to come.  


Both of us test comfortably on the autism scale, a condition that generally renders grandiose displays of romanticism quite unlikely. They aren't rational, and don't make sense to most wired this way. While I am prone to erratic behavior (I once traveled across the country with a guitar and toothbrush), Kitty is not. As the long-time responsible girl with a hefty dose of ""Catholic guilt"" and a penchant for safe decisions, Kitty is taking a major step for what she calls ""a chance at happiness"" with me. I wish we'd have taken that step ten years ago, but here we are.  


For us to make such a grand decision in just a few weeks is not characteristic for the muted emotions typical of those with our conditions, and health problems and other concerns outside the scope of this writing may limit the time we will be able to spend together on this Earth. Truthfully, the outcome of this campaign will matter little - I will do whatever it takes to be with her, and she with me.  


Any support garnered here will help Kitty and I to displace the burden placed on our families by our decision, and funds raised beyond the threshold will help us to become more independent as I search for a job in her area.  


Money is a struggle, always, and I know that it is likely a struggle for you as well. Anything you can spare for our effort will mean more to us than you likely realize, and will truly be remembered for the rest of our lives - together or apart, whatever fate and our temperaments decide. Your kindness will lend itself to our holiday miracle, and I believe the joy it will bring us will not go unrewarded by the forces that be - Karma, God, the Circle of Life, etc.  


Even should you choose not to donate, it is a great treasure to me that you've taken the time to read. To me, kind thoughts and wishes mean significantly more than money.  


Best wishes, much love, and may blessings be with you always.  


Sincerely,  
jack"
,Honest question: Why does this sub exist?,"If people are allowed to post reasons they need help why are other people that say they are going to help and don't still allowed to be members of this sub?

Awhile back I posted a legitimate reason I needed help and even though nobody actually helped there was one individual that said he would help me. He never did, and I never got any help so shouldn't those users be banned for falsely offering help? It's as bad as those people who legitimately need pain medication but are refused because of assholes who game the system to get medication who aren't deserving. I am going to loose my home that my deceased  dad built for me and my mother and we will both be forced into a nursing home because our combined income cant pay for bills + monthly upkeep and all I needed to do was get a decent enough lawyer that could have helped me fight stupid insurance companies and their extremely outrageous policies."
,My step dad passed away a couple days ago after being involved in a car crash the day before Thanksgiving.,"The day before Thanksgiving, he was driving to the store and lost control of his car, crashing into a street sign, sending him spinning into 2 more trees going 50 mph. Surprisingly he lived and was air lifted to the hospital. He then became paralyzed from the waist down due to a  crushed vertebra. 

He had to then get emergency surgery the next morning to take out shards of bone that were crushing his spinal cord. The doctors were hopeful that by removing the shards, he would get feeling in his legs again. Sadly, he did not regain feeling. 

For about a month up until his death, he fought infection after infection. He had good days and bad days. My mom stayed with him in the hospital almost the whole month as he was transferred from place to place. My mom received a phone call a couple days ago saying my step dad had gone in to respiratory distress. When she arrived, he had gone into cardiac arrest which ultimately was the cod. This was completely from left field as he was making progress and doing good due to the situation. 

My mom is devastated along with everyone else. Shes going to be struggling to pay for all of the medical bills in the coming time. If you've made it this far, thank you for reading. He was only in his 40s and left behind my mom (wife), 2 teenage boys, friends and family.

,"Operation: Save Morty, Save My Life","Hey Everyone. I apologize in advance for the wall of text. A lot is going on right now. I'm writing today because I find myself in an incredibly desperate situation. Typically I try and keep my head down around the holidays and keep to myself because they're a particularly hard time of year for me, but this year circumstances have left me stuck with no foreseeable way out, unless I ask for help. Here are the details:

I work for a non-profit in education and during the winter the organization I run my program out of has asked that I work their charity over the winter for their summer camp. They would pay me 250 a week before taxes and allow me to live on property until my season started up again in the spring. I said yes because its a good cause and, lets be honest, for a seasonal worker a place to live during the winter is huge. 

I did it last year and it was fine. Rough, but fine. I'm not used to making a lot of money anyways. If you work in outdoor education, even if you run your own facility, like I do, you're really not ever going to accumulate wealth of any kind. That's not why you choose that kind of work. 

This year has been different. This year I had some unexpected expenses right before winter started, which depleted me cushion that I had in preparation for what my friend calls ""The Salad Days"". Basically the winter months where we're going to be completely strapped. I went into this knowing I'd be struggling, but hoping nothing else would come up. Ha. 

Why I need help:

A week into winter and the pipe coming off of my catalytic converter starts shaking itself apart. It gets exponentially louder in the matter of hours so I rush it to a mechanic (without my car being operational, I can't make it to work. No work = No house. Essentially, if my car goes down, I'm homeless) The mechanic fixes it up and its quiet for about a day, then it gets loud again. This time its my CV joint. I talk to the mechanic and it he said its looking like 500-600 dollars for the part and the labor. I've got 46.74 in my bank account so I tell him thanks and that I'll schedule an appointment when I can. 

The next morning the fire alarm goes off and the fire brigade shows up. (I live in a campus setting so if an alarm goes off for any reason they send the troops, even if its a false alarm) When they're up there, an undercover police officer goes with them and runs everyone on properties plats and discovers that the registration on my car went out. 

Stupid mistake, I missed it by like 2 days. Luckily the next day is payday so I call up the RMV to fix my error and they tell me that there is a Non-Renewal on my car. Okay.... so I call the town commonwealth and for 3 days play phone tag, only to then have them close for the holidays. Luckily I got a hold of them today to figure out what's going on. 

Turns out, I had an excise tax that never made it to my mailbox (or at least no into my hands after it got to the mail room). This tax has since been sent to collection and has grown quite a bit. I also never received any letters from the collection agency. I asked the person on the phone to verify my address, and it was correct. I talked to the mail room and they didn't know what to say, I have been getting all of my mail, just not any collection letters or even the initial bill? 

At this point, my monthly bills (Phone, Insurance, Student Loans, ect) leave me with just enough money for food and gas. Sometimes not enough for the former, but I'm resourceful and can make food go a long way. There is no possible way for me to save up to pay this tax, which is now at around 260, which means I'll be unable to register my car, at about 80, which means its only a matter of time until a police officer scans my plate and I either get my car taken away or get more fines piled on top. Thats if the poor guy even makes it long enough without that CV replacement to get pulled over. 

I'm looking at:

600-700 for repairs260 for the collections80 for my car registration. 

I really am bad at asking for help. The 1000 seems like an impossible amount of money, and I'm really sorry. I just... at this point I just don't know what to do. 

Thanks for all of you that read my giant post. I understand that its after the holidays so everyone is probably broke, I'm just hoping beyond hope that there's a light at the end of all this.

Recently we have both lost our jobs for various reasons. Hers was caused by work related stress, mine due to temp agency issues, (company likes to drop people without reason, found out after). Usually not a fan of asking for hand outs but its better than becoming homeless due to no rent. Due to the holidays it is hard to find work, especially now that its the time of year places are closed. Currently receiving unemployment but that doesn't give enough to cover the rent. Had multiple interviews last week but due to the holidays it seems I wont have any answers to that till rent is due.

Any and all help is appreciated.

Thank you, Happy Holidays

,My friend is in dire need of help.,"My friend is a 55 year old woman who needs help. She is an amazing person, and is now homeless. Anything you can give is wonderful.

I will let her tell you the story. 



Please help us stay together


By us, I mean my dog Amber and myself. My name is Angie and at the age of 55 I have become homeless, along with my best and only friend Amber, my chocolate Dachshund.

We have been living in my car for the last 2 months and we went from being very miserable in the heat to extremely miserable in the cold. I had the money saved to build a tiny house but was waiting to heal from one surgery on my right foot, to now needing surgery on my left foot.

Some very unfortunate things happened to us at the hands of selfish greedy people (EVILDOERS) lol and I am now waiting for reimbursement from both my bank and my insurance company.

I'm not as resilient as I used to be and I've never been homeless. My dog is just as miserable as I am. I know her personality is changing and I recently started thinking about giving her away. I know she would be miserable if I did and I don't think that I would be able to continue fighting without her. She has known a much better life for the past 5 years and so have I.

Please help us get into some type of home. I do need surgery on my foot as soon as possible. Just being able to eat and keep warm have been next to impossible. Lately I've been eating every other day. I do have health insurance (my late husband was in the Navy), so as soon as I know that I have a stable roof over our heads, I will have the surgery. I don't want to lose my foot or my dog (I guess I'm kind of selfish that way LOL). I have tried every resource available in my area and unfortunately there are none if I want to keep my friend.


Please forgive any typos and formatting, this was written from my phone in my car. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Every little bit helps. We really don't want to be separated. She has horrible separation anxiety after I went to the hospital in an ambulance recently. Every prayer and kind word are appreciated. Thank you again!


I have an Amazon wish list, would definitely love some fresh fruit and cheese from Walmart. When you're trying to get things from Amazon and you're homeless, it doesn't work very well. There is a Locker near me.

,Treatment for Tommy,"Background

Tommy was rescued from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. My family and I adopted him early this year as a kitten from a local rescue. This is our first Christmas with him. He is the sweetest, cuddliest cat ever because he was bottle fed from a few days old. He loves to play and cuddle with our other kitten Chester. Chester will be devastated if he loses his brother. 

Diagnosis

Tommy was just diagnosed with ocular dry FIP, (feline infectious peritonitis) and it is always fatal without treatment. He is still eating and walking, and hasn’t lost weight yet. He can’t see out of his right eye because it is so inflamed.

Treatment Cost

There is only one possible treatment. He will need to be on it for a minimum of 84 days. The starting dose is 8mg and it may need to be increased to 10mg depending on how he does.If we treat him with 8mg the whole time and use the cheapest version ($80 a bottle) it will be at least $2,756. The more expensive version which is more reliable and causes less pain is $356 a bottle and it would cost $11,081 in total.  Any extra money would be refunded.

,Help me go to university.," Hello, I'm from El Salvador. I'm type 1 diabetic since I was 15 years old and I'm the oldest son of four. My mom doesn't have a job and we are basically maintained by our father, who is deeply sunk in debt. We all live in a two-bedroom house. My parents also suffer from some chronic medical conditions which the government has no assistance for, which causes that all of our family income has to be  completely directed towards medicines and my siblings' education.  

 This year, I graduated from High School. As a proof of my endless effort and will to overcome my family's situation and to be a better version of myself everyday, and also as a way to thank the effort my parents have made throghout these years so that I could graduate, I did my absolute best to excell in every possible way and got to be the Valedictorian in my class. I also got the best PAES (a nation-wide standarized test) score in the history of my school.   My dream is to become a computer science engineer and I got accepted in the best university for that career here. We also got the lowest monthly payment possible due to our socioeconomical status ($137) which is an incredible price for my family to pay. (School was more than half of that price).  

 For obvious reasons, I'm not able to get a job at this very moment, which makes me feel like a burden to my family. $1.5k dollars would be almost enough for me to study the first year, while I look for a job so that I can pay for myself the rest of my career. I just need a little push, and I'd be endlessly grateful if you can help me.

,A really good friend needs help,"I’ve known this streamer for a bit of time, and he needs help, I am not one for words, although I wish I was in this situation, so I’ll let you read it.

“I am a 26 year old male born in Pennsylvania and now currently staying in Miami.

In May of 2015, my life went downhill the day my Mother suffered an abrupt and violent stroke in front of me, which led to her being ran to the hospital, went into a coma, suffered multiple organ failures and passed away soon after we requested and signed a “Do not Resuscitate” (It was her wish, and she reminded me constantly through my adolescence as she hated staying at the hospital all the time and being pricked with needles)

At the time I was 21, a dropout of FIU, working a minimum wage at McDonald’s and had some decent amount of money being put away in my bank account, and several Credit Cards that have never been used as an emergency net. Apparently my Dad told me Social Security sent a letter and was demanding money back from my deceased mother because apparently there was something about “overpayment and the bill was carried over to him, the spouse”, I don’t remember seeing what was on the Pink letter.

My Dad pleaded for me to help, promising to pay me back. Considering my parents were both disabled receiving benefits, this impacted our quality of life since we, as a family, lost a chunk of income. And I was still living with my parents trying to pay off my school loans in exchange for getting groceries for my parents and taking care of the occasional bill.

I gave him whatever he needed, I even ruined my credit maxing out 2 of my credit cards on a Down Payment for a TempurPedic Bed, so he can sleep better because of multiple back surgeries. ($6800 Retail, with adjustable height. $1800 Down Payment, and 2 extra credit lines taken out, one for $4000 and one for $1000.) This was all under my name, since my Dad’s Credit was dogsh*t and couldn’t get approved for anything. He paid off the large credit line, and conveniently forgot about the other one. Anytime it was brought up he would constantly remind me by saying: “I pay the bills, no one is helping me here, and you all should be kissing the ground I walk on, I’m not giving you anything”

Fast forward another 4 years of attempting to pay off Credit Cards and draining them again, and then fueling my Dad’s pack-a-day smoke habit,(or be threatened to get kicked out) I get a Security License, and got a better job as a Security Officer in late 2018. Things were starting to look better despite what has happened.

On July 12, 2019 I was on my to Security HQ for more training when a Black BMW T-boned me while I was riding in an Uber. The Uber driver was literally about to park outside the destination when we got nailed, he didn’t stop when he hit us, and pushed us off the road into the grass past the sidewalk and the tires of the Uber driver’s Car were taken off of the rim. I was in the front seat with my seatbelt on looking down at my phone when the impact happened, I was not able to brace for it, and got whiplashed into the passenger door. We had another passenger in the backseat of the Uber, she didn’t have a seatbelt on and was launched from the driver side to my side,(we were hit from the backseat driver-side door) I want you to use that as a reference as how hard the impact was.

Upon being checked out by paramedics I called 411 and received information on an accident Lawyer. I hired the lawyer and over 3 months I received Spinal and Joint care therapy appointed by said lawyer, and any bills that would incur that the Black BMW Driver’s Insurance would pay it since he was at fault.

Today I was informed, despite never being insured myself, that the lawyer had negotiated PIP injury coverage for $10,000, and that all the medical bills I accrued was over $10,000. On top of that the negotiation of lost wages,(5 months worth since today) and for my pain and suffering, only got me $10,000. That’s $10,000 BEFORE 33% Lawyer cut, other small fees and a very good chance that any money left over would likely go towards taking care of the medical expenses that went over the $10,000 limit.

But here’s the thing, I’m not getting any better, I can’t go back to work, I’m in constant pain and I have difficulty sleeping, I have 2 herniated discs in my Cervical Spine(C6,C7) and more problems in my lower back.

So here I am currently, with one Credit Card company suing me in January for $2,300 plus fees, with the other companies following suit inevitably soon, trapped home with a controlling and manipulating Father with nowhere to go, with no friends, no other relatives, spiraling down into suicidal depression. I see no way out, other than the sweet embrace of death. I helped someone I should’ve never helped, I was conditioned at a young age being beaten by my older brother and my father for ever speaking how I felt, whenever I angered them with what I say, to essentially be a coward who was afraid of to say anything for fear of being ridiculed or tortured by my older brother, and to always say yes to whatever my father demands from me, be it money or anything, or else I would be homeless.

This amount I am asking for would clear me of all debts ($25,000-30,000) as well as something for myself to escape my current situation until my Social Security Disability gets approved.

Why donate to me? Well you’d be able to essentially save my life from an otherwise inescapable situation. Because at this rate, my life is not worth living.”

,REPOST - Colombian International Student In Canada About To Lose Student Visa Mere Months Before Graduation: Please Help!,"Hi there everyone. I am back trying to help a friend of mine who is facing down some really big problems right now. Neither of us are the best when it comes to social media so please bear with me.

Paula and I both work in the film industry in Vancouver BC and she is something else. She came from Colombia to Canada to study and join our film industry. She has somehow managed to work up to 3+ jobs at once AND go to Capilano University where she is absolutely kicking ass in one of the top film programs in the country. I have not met many people who can hope to match how determined she is and has proven herself to be.

That all being said, Paula needs our help.

\*\* You can follow her story on the GoFundMe link below, if you would prefer a primary description of events. \*\*

Paula is staring down having to leave Canada (and her education) soon despite being very close to graduating (April). Due to political unrest and financial issues related to the economy at home in Colombia, and despite doing everything a person in her position could do to pay her own way, she needs to raise A LOT of tuition money very quickly (by the end of December) if she wants to continue with her career and life here - which I assure you is in the best interests of everybody fortunate enough to have the opportunity to get to know her (much less work with her, holy cow). She also has already had someone hack her facebook earlier in our campaign to try and steal what we have already raised, so she could use a break :/

I think Paula’s situation is incredibly unfortunate, and the scale of her conviction to overcome it is something unique.

I’d be hard-pressed to name another cause that deserves your support more than this one right now, because honestly Paula embodies a certain type of spirit and determination that doesn’t come around every day.

Whether you can donate or you know another way to help, this is one of those rare occasions where you can truly feel certain that you are doing something positive - not just for Paula, but for my country of Canada honestly. She deserves to be here, and trust me when I say that we as Canadians want what she brings to the table when it comes to work ethic and creativity. She isn’t even asking for the full amount, cause she’s freaking crazy determined to do it with or without us.

I’d like it to be with us. She’s the definition of a hard-working Canadian. So help me help her, let’s show her how Canada gets down when someone fights this hard and needs our help.

If you are Canadian, or you understand what I mean, then this one is for you.

,My best friend needs help escaping her abusive home,"My best friend has been abused by her stepdad for many many years, but the abuse came to a head late last year and me and Violet’s other close friends have been working really hard to support her and help her escape. Her stepdad verbally assaults her, steals her entire income, and threatens her regularly. We’ve arranged for her to make her escape late January 2020, and she will have a safe place to live. However, she needs some help covering some expenses to help her get back on her feet. We purposely made the gofundme goal relatively small so we could have realistic expectations while still being able to support her as she transitions into a safe household. Violet describes her experience more in her gofundme description if you’d like more details of the abuse. I can provide screenshots of us discussing her escaping the household if needed as verification. 


If you can send me verification that you have donated, I will hand stitch you a custom cross stitch (within reason) of your choice and mail it to you.

-----------Here is a small glimpse of what it's been like ------

Now that you all have a small clue of what I'm dealing with let me take you back a year, Summer 2018, I was fairly in normal shape, was losing weight and trying to keep up with my then one year old. I started having pain around my rib/left breast, then my left arm started to swell and hurt. I went to the hospital as my right arm started to do the same, while in the waiting room both of my legs and feet started swelling and i started getting pain. They sent me home thinking it was just my Iron Allergy (Oh I forgot to mention this earlier, I am allergic to iron, in all ways) so they gave me allergy medication and sent me home. Less than a week later I went back to the hospital, my pain was worse than before and the swelling did not go down. Feeling pins and needles in my extremities and now my face I got sent home once more. The next day I didn't even want to move, my mom asked me to go to another ER where they did a cat scan (which came back clear) and set an appointment for me for a neurologist in their clinic. I went to said appointment and had an MRI done a couple of months later (10 small unspecified white matter lesions) and was asked to see my PCP. Getting a PCP with time in their schedule is difficult, i settled down at last at NYU Astoria, as my symptoms were only getting worse, i started getting back pains that came and went away on their own. I wound up in the hospital once more, this time because i couldn't walk from pain, apart from my other symptoms in the 5 months between hospital visits i developed blurrier vision as normal, memory problems which seemed minor, extreme sleepiness, concentration issues and after more testing done and more dead ends the doctors started believing it could be MS. This hospital visit was 4 days around Halloween. Being in the hospital once more for 3 days in December for loss of ability to walk and getting my first appointment with my PCP that month was a breath of fresh air. Now onto the present, I have now lost the ability of going out alone, I use diapers now, being in my home alone, my memory keeps getting worse as I have lost most of my young years and teenage years. I cannot concentrate, at times my voice disappears for a couple of hours, my pain is so intense that I wake up screaming at night sometimes, getting hugged and touched leaves me crying even when I am taking all my medicine strictly. At times I cannot even walk to the bathroom, or sit up in bed. I still have tingling, numbness at times, extreme sleepiness, and hopefully haven't forgotten anything here. Please if anyone can point me in any direction I will happily do any test, I have been in the hospital for days on end and just want to know what i have."
,Hoping for an angel,"

I have tried this GoFundMe thing once before, I didn’t get very far and as I have limited family and no actual friends or social media I have found it very hard to reach out to people and ask for help even as I hate doing so, I was always the one with my hand out to others mainly my family....now I just been stuck on the other end.

Fast version is in 2018 I lost two of my closest family members, my grandmother and uncle both from CHF I did all I could to help in every way, including financially which really put me in a bad spot but I don’t regret that. I had a job so bills were paid, credit was being stretched then I lost my job at the college I attended and my credit carried me some as well as some odds and ends jobs. Sold just about all I could on eBay to just float by hoping to get stable work but that has not been fruitful. 

My original GoFundMe was to help with bills and my debt, that has come and passed now getting lawsuits threats and endless calls. Winter is here really and the cold is setting in, I need to get  $500  fast which I’m hopeless to think I can get that in such a short time, trying not to lose heat and have my pipes freeze. Eh the link to my GoFundMe is here if anyone feels it is worth giving, I am not currently dying and see so many others in need it is just sad. I am so tired and stressed, I have thought of going to the borrow sub here but being honest I highly doubt someone would lend money to someone knowing that I could not pay back anytime soon if at all and I would clearly state that if I posted. I been scammed before and it is not a good feeling, more so when in need, so please no DM saying you have an opportunity for me just to try and take or use me, really can’t handle that stuff right now.

,Greta ain't the only game in town (aka Piper Saves The Planet!),"NOTE: this post was originally made by u/Iwannakissolisykes, but it was removed as they did not have enough comment karma. I wanted to help them & Piper out on their quest, so I'm reposting (as i cannot donate). Here is the post in its entirety:


Hello everyone!

My eight year old daughter Piper has recently taken an INCREDIBLE interest in the environment and the world around her.

She recently watched a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvuN_WvF1to) on YouTube which led her inquisitive mind to grill her daddy (he's actually her stepdad, but those are fighting words to Piper lol but he's a science junkie) on the contents of the video.

After several conversations with her daddy, where he explained global eco systems, greenhouse gases, environmental impacts, and sustainability over several days, Piper decided she wanted to be a person of action, rather than a person of complacency.

So she came up with a plan on her own, asked for our help and support, and is asking for yours.

Piper needs help to purchase several things in her quest for Eco Justice. Here's a list:

-A couple of highly visible safety vests so she can walk with us as a family and pick up trash in our area and eventually spread to our town and hopefully our county.

-Work gloves so she doesn't have to handle trash (she's eight and while she's excited about helping the environment, she's a little grossed out by the thought of picking up something slimy lol).

-Industrial size and strength trash bags.

-A trash grabber

So this is ""Phase One"" of Piper's plan. From there, it only gets more ambitious lol.

She wants to plant 3,650 trees before Christmas of 2020. We live in a rural area which is heavily forested, but you can never have too many trees, they're a renewable resource, and they create jobs.

Our area is economically depressed and for generations families have scratched a living out of the landscape with timber and coal. Coal's time has passed, and our forefathers didn't think to plant as many trees back as they cut. Piper plans to remedy that to the best of her abilities.

So ""Phase Two"" needs are a little broader in scope:

-To plant regional and indigenous trees (maple, oak, birch, pines) the average cost is around 75 cents per tree, unless bulk orders are placed.

-Some digging and planting implements.

-Some local and regional topography maps.

-A tree ""wellness kit"" to get it started off right in the world. Such as pruning shears, mulch, stakes, ribbon, and bailing wire.

Hiking boots, a GPS capable cellphone, fuel, backpacks and necessary items for transport of the tools, trees, and snacks lol
-To have this plan grow to include organized hikes which focus on planting trees, removal of trash, and spreading awareness. 

So Piper, as well as we, are asking for your help and support. Piper is a very intelligent child who has more empathy for the planet and fellow humans than most adults I know. She's experienced some trauma and challenging times in her life and we feel that Piper's ""cause"" will not only help the environment but Piper as well.

Both myself and Piper's daddy have ample time to dedicate to ""Piper Saves the Planet"", but one area we are significantly lacking in is our own personal funds to make her dreams come true. We are a family of four living off of one poverty level income, I receive no financial assistance from my daughter's biological father, and we simply don't have any income to spare. But if anyone is willing to make Piper's plan a reality with a donation, my husband and I will ensure we all dedicate the necessary time and energy to make Piper Saves the Planet really happen!

Any individual that supports Piper in this cause will be heavily invested as well. Details will be shared of where funds are allocated, feedback and ideas will be encouraged through the entire process, every tree planted will be Geo tagged for location, and every individual that donates will receive updates on progress and pictures of Piper's efforts, all updated regularly through social media platforms.

Piper still believes in the good in the world. And has the determination to see that the world is a better place. We can't personally give our children much for Christmas, but as parents, we both feel hope for the future is better than any possession.

""We did not inherit the land from our ancestors. We borrow it from our children"".

""Only after the last tree has been cut down. Only after the last river has been poisoned. Only after the last fish has been caught. Only then will you realize money cannot be eaten"".

Thank you all!

,Helping Tina and her family,"Posting for a good friend that does not have a reddit account.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/helping-tina-and-her-family

Tina is currently jobless and about to lose the apartment she lives in with her three children. If she loses it, she will be back in the homelessness that took her two years to get out of. She needs $400 by January 1 in order to keep her apartment for another month, and she needs money for groceries, utilities, and other necessities. Plus, it may take her another month or so to find work that she can do, and so she may need some more beyond that - thus, this campaign is asking for $1,000 for her. The $1,000 will help keep her and her family housed while Tina tries to find work in order to become self-sufficient.

I met Tina on December 14, 2019, when she asked me in the parking lot of my local supermarket if I wanted to buy one of the candy canes she was selling in order to feed her children. I didn't buy the candy cane, but I started feeling bad, and when I exited the store a few minutes later after buying my groceries, I saw that she was still in the parking lot, and so I offered to buy Tina some food. As I was buying her some food, we talked, and she told me she wasn't homeless but that she had lost her job cleaning houses and was in danger of losing her apartment because she doesn't have enough money yet to pay the January rent of $1,600 (for a one-bedroom apartment she shares with her three children in a somewhat sketchy part of Long Beach).

There was something about Tina that seemed different from all the people hanging out in the parking lot trying to get a spare dollar from people entering and exiting the store: Despite her dire situation, she seemed to retain her dignity, and she wasn't begging - she was trying to sell candy canes that she had bought. Also, she asked me one or two questions about me, which struck me as very nice, especially for a person who is in survival mode and couldn't be blamed for thinking only about herself and her family at all times.

I felt bad that the money I spent on the food didn't really buy very much food for her, and  I decided later to see if she would be there another day and to help her again with groceries. I found her there a couple days later and got her cellphone number so that I could find her again and help her more. I bought her some more food and some other necessities.

As I took Tina shopping a few more times, I learned more about her story. Originally from the Boston area, she moved to Las Vegas as a young adult and was a casino janitorial worker there. She lived there for about 20 years before coming to California. She was married to an abusive man, whom she finally divorced, but he didn't (and still doesn't) pay any alimony. She has three children: an 18-year-old son, a 14-year-old daughter, and a 12-year-old son. In California, Tina and the children ended up homeless and living in her car for a couple of years on the streets of Hollywood, which is a glamorous place for tourists and entertainment stars and wealthy people living in the residential parts but a nightmare of a place for the homeless living in the hustle-bustle part.

In that period of homelessness, Tina saved up money from cleaning houses and got an apartment a couple of months ago, but she lost her job, earlier this month, cleaning houses because she started having trouble getting to work (she shares the car with her son, who uses the car to go to various places to work odd jobs to help pay for their apartment).

Tina grew up poor and married a man who was abusive toward her. Her whole life has been chaotic. But she doesn't drink or take drugs. (She does smoke cigarettes, and I'm trying to get her to quit. She says she doesn't smoke that much, and it's the only thing she does to try to ward off the stress of her life - she also says that she's quit before and plans to quit smoking again when she isn't as stressed.) 

Tina wants to earn an honest living. She doesn't panhandle. She has been buying candy canes at the local Dollar Tree store and selling them for a higher price in supermarket parking lots, trying to earn money, but it barely pays for groceries for her and her children some days, and some days, she doesn't sell enough when supermarket managers tell her to leave, and then she has to waste time trying to find another place to sell the candy canes.

I'm trying to help her find cleaning work that is nearby (or for which employers can give her a ride, which happens sometimes) in order to not return to the situation of not having reliable transportation because her son is using the car to also try to earn money for them. The best job for Tina to reach self-sufficiency, as weird as it sounds, is clean houses or businesses. She's good at it, and if she has consistent work, it can pay for her and her family's needs. I thought about trying to take her to interviews at fast-food places and stores that are hiring, but as she's trying to take care of her kids and sell the candy canes, it's hard to take her to interviews where she may or may not get the job. Also, she doesn't have a lot of clothes, and what she has isn't really nice enough to make a good impression at a job interview.

Tina's situation of poverty is difficult, but I'm trying to help her get to a point of self-sufficiency. I work for myself, and my business has been slower than the usual (due to the holiday season) in the week-and-a-half I've known Tina, but eventually I will not be able to help Tina as much as I have been, in terms of time and money.

That's why I set up this page for Tina. The immediate need is for $400 to pay her rent for January. Her 12-year-old son has psychological problems and gets Social Security payments, which pay for only part of the rent. Tina also needs money for things like groceries and utilities. If she had that, she could spend her time looking for cleaning work instead of trying to sell candy canes. I'm asking for $1,000 for Tina for the $400 she needs for the remainder of the rent plus groceries and utilities but also in case she's in this situation next month, as it might take a couple months to find her a sustainable cleaning job. I will disburse the money to Tina as she needs it, and I will try to guide her out of this chaos.

If anybody in Long Beach wants to meet Tina and help her with things like trying to find work or giving her rides (once you've met and gotten to know each other enough to feel comfortable enough for that), I would love that, because I can't help Tina by myself for too much longer. Tina's parents are deceased. She does have two sisters, but they are poor also and can't really help her."
,Brother in laws brother was in a serious car accident,"Adrian is in critical condition and needs your help.

A terrific friend, husband, and dog-dad to his and his wife Stephanie's pup Leia, Adrian is a hardworking, gentle-hearted, good natured and all around wonderful guy. Due to unknown reasons-- there were no skid marks-- Adrian was in a catastrophic accident while driving on a work errand Tuesday, July 17 and was found unconscious.  His new car was totalled, and paramedics had to use the jaws of life to extract him. He was taken to a nearby hospital in West L.A., where he has remained in a coma ever since. His injuries are numerous and severe: he almost lost an eye, has received countless stitches and needed blood drained from his skull due to swelling. Thankfully he does not appear to have brain damage and his eye seems to be healing.

Stephanie, Adrian's wife, along with his roommate Johnny and family are staying by his side as long as it takes him to recover. Unfortunately doctors are unable to give an idea of how long it could take for him to wake up-- it could be a matter of days, weeks, or more. As you can imagine, this is an unimaginable amount of stress: due to mounting bills and the regular strain of daily budgeting, Stephanie has to balance her full time job with visits to the hospital. 

How can you help?

While only time will help Adrian heal, we can come together to alleviate some of the financial stress this puts on Stephanie so she can spend more time with him and can take care of herself-- and Leia! We're asking for donations to cover the immediate out-of-pocket expense that are cropping up to give his family one less thing to worry about. It's important that Adrian be surrounded by the ones he loves so he can find the strength to heal and recover. He and Stephanie are two of the most generous and loving people in L.A.: let's help them through this.

He was flown to denver where he underwent 8 hours of surgery to fuse his spine from the T2 to T10 vertebra. We are currently praying he regains feeling in his legs but won't know for 72 hours, he is currently in a forced coma to keep him from moving and allow his spine to heal. His family has set up a GoFundMe to help pay his medical bills, a flight for life alone can cost $12,000 to $20,000 so any and all donations are appreciated. They are also asking that everyone keep Todd in their thoughts and prayers, they have asked that anyone and everyone say a prayer for Todd. I'm hoping reddit can come together to help the nicest man I know that has always put others before himself. He has a long and expensive road to recovery ahead and any and all help is greatly appreciated.

I'm 36, disabled, and trying to get a wheelchair so I can get around my home and do my own shopping again without having to rely on electric carts that may or may not work at the store.

I had a prescription in for a wheelchair and after months of waiting, my doctor CANCELED the prescription saying ""Patient is getting a chair from a friend"".

No, I'm not, I never told her that or even said anything remotely like that. Now I can't get her to return my calls or messages about this.

I don't have my own income right now, I'm fighting for disability and I really need this chair. 

Any help is appreciated.

EDIT: My medical records proving the cerebral palsy were destroyed by the hospital I was born at after ten years, and the hard copies my parents kept were ruined in a flood. Still looking for a doctor to rediagnose me. Also I am getting (hopefully) a new doctor late next month, if things don't work out with her I'll keep trying.

My parents are stalking all of my social media, so I was very hesitant at making a fundraiser and posting this online, but the situation is getting worse and I’m getting desperate and need as much help as I can get; I also can’t use my actual birth name since I’m paranoid of them finding out about this.

The only thing that is stopping me from moving out and cutting connection with my family is that I am financially dependent on them, and I have nowhere and no one to go; due to them abusing me mentally, emotionally, and physically, I was never able to get a job, as I also wasn’t allowed to have a bank account on my own.

My story as short as possible: I currently am an international student in Canada, and I am studying a one-year program, after what my parents expect me to immediately get a job and live on my own here.

The reason why I’m here is that they want me to get a Canadian citizenship by studying so they’d be able to immigrate through me as well, which have put a lot of pressure onto me, and being afraid of failing their expectations of me resulted in me developing severe depression.

I don’t have any friends or relatives here, as integrating into a whole new different society without anyone I know by my side, all alone ever since I’ve arrived here, with no support system at all, resulted in me developing a severe anxiety and social phobia.

They also didn't want to pay for the college dorms, so I had to stay at a forest family here, - yesterday I was verbally sexually harassed by one of the family members, asking me invasive and inappropriate questions about my personal life, and in the end I was being told to “show my body more, since I’m so pretty”. When I told about this to the homeowner, I was told that I am lying, that it was a misunderstanding because I have a broken English (the man who harassed me told me that I have a very good English himself), and I need to pack my bags and get out of the house. As very stressed and frustrated, I had to apologize for “creating the misunderstanding”, so I would be left alone, but this man is still in this house with me. I feel very scared for my life as I am all alone here, there’s no one to stand up for me, and since I live in their house as an international student, they're free to do anything they want with me, it’s their word against mine.

I cant ask my family to move me to a different household since they would just get mad at me for wasting their money, I’ll have to go through their verbal harassment, and they would just tell me to suck it up because they don’t care about anything but me staying as long as I can to get them goddamn citizenship no matter what. So I’m stuck at a place I feel myself unsafe, surrounded by hostile people, and have no one around.

I am not being allowed to apply to any other school or university in a different place, to a program I like, - creative writing; I am an aspired writer and author who’d like to get more knowledge and experience, I am eager to learn, I want to make a difference in the world with my work.

I know that staying in Canada far away from my family is my best shot at breaking free, but I am not able to get any mental health help here as my parents send me very limited amount of money to live on every month that can only cover the cost of groceries, and I hate feeling helpless that I have no other options other than staying here, with no one I know around and with my mental condition getting worse every day, or going back home, where I know for sure I’d be done for good.

What I need is to get enough money on getting a European visa to get to my relative living in Netherlands, for a flight ticket, and money to cover for my expenses, health issues, and to save sum up for my future education.

Any donations will greatly help me to break free from my abusive family’s control and influence, and everything counts and means the world to me."

I’ve provided the GoFundMe blurb below.

—————————-


GoFundMe:

Many people who know my Mother (Mary “Missy” Burton)  know that the last three years of her life has been very hard on her. She had lost her mother, great-grandmother, had back surgery, companion animal and had two mini-strokes, all of this while she battled other ailments that have rendered her disable, such as: SLE Lupus - autoimmune disease, ITP - clotting disorder, Type 2 Diabetes, Rheumatoid Arthritis and Raynaud's Syndrome. She lives her life daily in excruciating pain. 

She had been fighting against the odds since the day she was born, a child of a single parent whom then became a single parent of two children. Through all of the fighting, pain and heartache she always kept a smile on her face and kept pushing through life trying to provide the best life for everyone around her.

I recently overheard a conversation between my mother and her best friend Ana. They were talking about lost family members and how they were aging and they felt as if they were trying to run out of time. Mom had shared she would love to go on a cruise and leave the country before she passed, Ana agreed and mom laughed. “It’s on the bucket list now, so we have to do it.” she said.

And thus, dear reader--Missy’s Travel Wish was born. My mother’s birth date is January 27th which I will share the progress of this page with her and let her share it to her own page then too. I ask anyone that knows her, please do not mention this page to her until then.

Funds will go to cover cruise costs for three, hotel, flights, and on board needs. I will post updates as time passes, but for now…

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Forever grateful,
Devyn

,Father in need of help getting out of debt,"My father has worked hard throughout his entire life to support our family, pay the bills, and make sure we're all happy.   


As of last year, he developed a brain tumor, and has been fighting hard ever since. After his first surgery he lost the use of the right side of his body, and hasn't been able to work since. Because of this our family business has slowly lost more and more clients and money, to the point where it needs to be sold for pennies.   


We have no source of income now, and no way to sustain ourselves through these hard times, out side of the odd jobs I take to help during school and the support of our family. Unfortunately, my dad's father just passed away last week, so with funeral costs we're in a tight spot and my family including I are still shook up. We could really use some help before the holidays to put us back on our feet, and to help us survive long term.  


Anything is appreciated. Happy Holidays to you all, and bless your families with good health.

Please however do not feel any obbligation to support me since everyone needs their money in my experience and I wouldn't ever want to take away from another person.

,Family needs support while mom (me) is recovering from surgery,"Hi! 
At the end of November I was rushed to hospital because I was jaundiced (yellow skin, liver not working properly) and low energy. 
I was admitted that night after an ultrasound that showed it was caused by a gallstone because of a gallbladder attack I had the week prior. I had a stone blocking a duct and all the nasty was backing into my body. After multiple types of blood work done it showed that not only was my gallbladder, and liver really upset with me, but my pancreas was suffering and I also had a blood infection. I was told I was lucky I came in when I did or I possibly would have lost my life. 
I was scheduled for 2 surgeries, one to remove the stone and one to remove my gallbladder, I was on almost round the clock antibiotics. They did blood work every morning, and it started to show improvements, so I got sent for an MRI that showed everything in my body was MAD but I had passed the stone, so I only needed 1 surgery now to remove the pesky trouble making gallbladder. 
I was in the hospital for 6 days, in which time they got the blood infection under control as well as removed my gallbladder. 
While all of this was happening to me, my family was left with out a mom/wife. I have 3 children an 8 year old son whom is autistic and 9 month old twin daughters. My husband has had to take leave from work while I was in hospital and for my recovery, and being as we are in Canada has applied for Paternity Leave. 
Our finances we extremely tight before this and paternity leave only gives him 55% of his income (I am a stay at home mom). As of me posting this his paternity leave benefits have not been approved, so we have been with out an income since the end of November. 
This situation is very hard on me, I'm not allowed to lift anything heavier then 10 lbs, my girls are 21lbs and 22lbs. I am dealing with alot of soreness where my incisions are as well as nausea, headaches and dizziness. I'm worried about how we are going to pay for rent and food. Let alone utilities or any emergencies that come up (like all three children currently are sick, high fevers sniffles, coughing and we are running out of meds for them)
I am greatful to be home, and to still be here for my family. 
We don't have the greatest support system in the world but they are trying that's why I'm turning to you reddit.

On the first week of october, i feel a lump on my neck and it was a pea size and the lump on my armpit got bigger also. I called the doctor and he said that i really need to get a lab tests to determine my condition and we need to prepare a large amount of money for all the medical tests and for the possible surgery. The doctor said my case was rare and its a immediate medical care. I don't have health insurance and here in the philippines we don't have foundation that will help you with your medical test bill. We also talked to our government to ask for help but they said they can't help me due to the limited funds. I really got no choice but to create this fundraising to have a money for my medical tests.

Please help me and my family. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The locals, myself and other interns will be working to decrease Maternal/Fetal/Neonatal mortality rates.

Since this is so sudden I don’t have much time to save for these supplies to pay out of pocket like I have in the past, so I’ve turned to fundraising. 100% raised goes to equipment, medications, etc for the units I am on, and will be bought once I’m there to help support the economy.  If you are able to donate that would be incredibly helpful. If you have questions about anything please let me know :)

,Help With Stem Cell Transplant For Twins,"Hello everyone. I never thought in my life that I’d be making a post like this, but here I am. I am a 25 year old male from Brooklyn, NY. I was born with Sickle Cell Anemia. It’s a genetic condition that causes red blood cells to become sickle shaped and sticky instead of the normal smooth, disk shape. The changed causes the red blood cells to have shorter lifespans causing anemia and occlusions in the blood vessels which often leads to pain and/or organ damage.

When I was 16 in 2010 I had a Kidney Biopsy done and it come back that I had FSGS. Throughout this stretch of time in high school I was seemingly in pain all the time. Then suddenly all that calmed down. However, my kidneys were slowly being affected by the  Sickle Cell the whole entire time. So much so that this past year I was told I was at stage 5 CKD. 

Even though I don’t have many pain crises with Sickle Cell, that combined with worsening CKD my hemoglobin regularly drops to below 4. The Lowest being 2.7 last week. Even though my body has gotten used to such low numbers it still felt as close to death as possible without actually being dead. It felt as though if I didn’t use all my will power to move a limb it would stay paralyzed forever. Very scary.

I have recently gone through the six hour transplant evaluation appointment to get on the list for kidney transplant at Weill Cornell here in NYC. 

Despite my fighting, I’m now on dialysis with a perm-cath in my chest. I did not want this. With a transplant I won’t have to deal with this for very long but without a living donor, it’s 10 years wait time in NYC for a B+ kidney. 

I’m also going through the evaluation process for a stem cell transplant to correct my Sickle Cell in which they will do a half match from my mom and umbilical cord blood. That way the new kidney won’t be affected in the same way. 

Now multiply all that by two. That is what my twin brother and I are going through. We are going to receive the stem cell transplant soon and will need to stay in the hospital for 4 weeks. Afterwards we would need to stay in a hotel and provide our own food. Furthermore, because of the chemo and the immunosuppressants we cannot take public transport and would need a car to get to the many appointments in the road ahead. 

You can read more of the story on the GoFundMe site but please share if you cannot donate.

Thank You. Happy Holidays!

Hey, I had posted my campaign some time ago, so I'm using the reposts allowed rule two weeks later. Simply put: I'm disabled, a college dropout, and my only skills are in costumer service in call centers. Obviously a great combination for a hard working employee that you'd want to hire, right? 

Yes that was sarcasm. I just got declined from a position as a sales clerk at a sex shop. And that was the furthest I've gotten in an interview for the past half year. The Campaign explains all the details of the situation further and much better. Simply put: When I had a job, I got into debt over dumb survival choices, about 4k Euro when converted from CZK. I lost said job in July due to messed up paperwork related to sick leave. I didn't want to pass out in the tram on the way there, and they didn't have work from home options. I haven't been able to get employed since, and my unemployed support stopped covering me a week ago. So, I'm trying to collect funds to pay off my debts in one fell swoop, and to then use the remaining money from the goal to move in with my partners, so that rent isn't an issue and I can live off of my writing. Which earns me about 120 USD a month right now, but I need 400 to cover everything currently. Could be down to 20 if you helped this campaign. 

I appreciate everything, from sharing this around to donations. Thank you."

,Help elementary students learn about Native American culture,"My wife is a teacher at Kapowsin Elementary School, where they are raising money to help students go on a field trip to Tillicum Village. This is an amazing opportunity for those students to be immersed in the Native American Culture of the Pacific Northwest!

With the help of a grant, they've gotten the cost of the field trip down significantly. There's more costs to cover, however. Their current goal is $850, which would lower the cost of the field trip down to just $10 per student. If they were to achieve double their goal, the trip would be **completely free** to all students!

If you're passionate about education or Native American history, this is a fantastic way for you to help out few hundred students.

I finished my Associate's degree last year, transferred my credits, and now I'm a Junior at a local 4-year university. Unfortunately, many of the grants and scholarships I've relied on are running out and I'm having to take out hefty student loans in order to finish off the last \~1.5 years of my degree. My disabilities are severe enough that I'm not capable of going to school and working at the same time, and in hopes of keeping my student loan debts down, I've turned to GoFundMe and Reddit.  


**Where's the donations going?**  
The money I receive will go towards paying for tuition, textbooks, transportation, and living expenses while I'm attending college. The cost to finish my degree is expected to be around $20,000. I'm hoping to get enough to make up the difference from my scholarships and grants. Any funds leftover will go towards paying down my student loans.  


**How can you help?**  
The easiest way you can help me is by donating directly to me at my  [**ABLE Savings**](http://www.sumday.com/gift/washington-able/ftoS4zYENki8j3N4f_Wkeg) account. ABLE is a federal and state-run program designed to allow disabled low-income people a chance to save money for needed expenses without losing their welfare benefits such as Social Security or SNAP food stamps. Donating directly to my ABLE account will not be counted against me when it comes to welfare services such as disability, Social Security, or Public Housing Assistance. Donations to GoFundMe also help; I do post updates on there at major points, I just posted about completing this semester *(two A's, an A-, and a B+!).* I just prefer the ABLE account because GoFundMe can be counted as income by the government and my landlady if conditions are just right.

,Help a family in need,"2019 has been quite the rollercoaster. I learned so much about who I am and how to be a better person in my own family. I have learned how to be a better partner to my wife, how to be a better person to my friends , and how to be a better father to my three wonderful children.

I quit my job back in September. I realized that I had some severe PTSD from my work environment. I worked as a rigger for a decade. I loved being a rigger. Being able to move large items from point a to point b in the environment that I worked in was often a challenge I was more than willing to put a forward thinking attitude towards. It was amazing some of the things that I’ve done. With that being said, the people were more often than not horrible human beings. I had a second level supervisor one time tell me that I was making his cancer worse because of the stress I had caused him. I had been working 12hr night shifts for a month and filling in as a first level supervisor. At the beginning of the shift, at a supervisor meeting, I was given an at-a-boy for all the work my crew and myself was getting done. This kind of crap was often my experience. 

I took out my retirement. My wife quit her job a month later from the same place. She filled a bunch of harassment charges and because all of them were legit, there has been a lot of witnesses coming forward and corrective actions still happening in December as a result.

So here is the deal and the reason for the post, I’m out of retirement money, I have little money for rent. I’ve been applying for jobs left and right. I’ve been looking for other means of financial assistance. I keep re-writing me resume to refine it and make it more worthwhile to any employers I’m actively seeking work with but to no end. Basically, I’m looking for help in my time of need. If you can help, that would be wonderful. If you have any ideas of other resources that would help, I would love to hear about that too. 

Tl;dr - I need help with rent. Any other help with resources would be great too. My family thanks you for any help.

,"UPDATE: I had my first surgery, and the bills are piling up. Please Help Our Family!"," [https://www.gofundme.com/f/helpthehoucks](https://www.gofundme.com/f/helpthehoucks) 

&#x200B;

My name is Sydney.  I'm a wife, and a mother, heading up a small family of four that cannot seem to escape the crisis in which we find ourselves.    


I have a treatable, but not curable genetic, auto-inflammatory condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa (Stage 3).  You can research it, but in simple terms, it's a condition that causes large, painful, non-healing abscesses and lesions across all parts of the body that houses apocrine sweat glands (under arms, over thighs, genitals, buttocks, down legs, etc).  At Stage 3, tracts form under the skin, in thick, rope-like formations that travel between the abscesses.    


To say that this condition isn't a pleasure to live with would be the understatement of the century.  Every day is spent in a constant agony that I cannot begin to describe, and because of the extremely painful nature of H.S., I cannot work, or properly care for my young children, (ages 1 and 2).    


I am currently undergoing treatment that should, in time, render me more able to at least make myself useful around the house, and a better part of our children's care, and would also enable us to find adequate work.  That said, recovery and management is an incredibly long road ahead of us (estimated to be about 6-7 months in total for this treatment to be completed), and therefore, we need help to make ends meet with our healthcare and living expenses, which run around $1.500 per month.    


Up until now, we've been relying on my meager earnings as a 3D Animator (the only real work that I'm capable of doing, as it only requires me to use a computer from home), and assistance from family.  This situation is putting an incredible strain on those relationships, and we fear that by the time our situation finally straightens out, we will have damaged all associations we have beyond repair.    


We'd like our children to be able to grow up having those relationships intact, and thus, we are turning to fundraising as a last resort to help keep us afloat until we can find our way back out of the woods.     


We are perfectly happy to provide any and all documentation of our situation, our bills, and my condition should it be required for acquiring any sort of assistance we may receive.    


If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading our story, and thank you in advance for any help you may be able to provide, or even for sharing our story with your friends.    


Much Love,  


The Houck Family"

,Veteran Mother stranded in Holland.,"Two years ago my mom moved back to Holland. She immigrated to the states when she was 11 and moved back there for work with her significant other In 2015. Shortly after moving there my mom was laid off and 9 months ago she decided her and her SO were going to move back here to Oregon. I sponsored her and her I-130 paperwork is currently in processing and is expected to be completed in the summer. 

Over the last 9 months my mom and her SO started liquidating all of their assets to raise funds for them to move back here. They raised quite a bit of money, about 3k.

Here is where things get shitty. Her and her SO split up and he decided to leave her in the states (hes a US citizen and she is not) when he moved back here at the beginning of Dec he stole all of the money they raised with him. Now she is left with all of the bills. I am in the process of trying to expedite her immigration process so that she can come live with me but it's getting no where. 

All I ask is for a small donation. $1 will make a difference for her. She is not only struggling financially but I know she is also dealing with depression and seeing anything donated will boost her morale. 

I will answer any questions you guys have so feel free to PM me or comment below.

,Flynn needs help fighting FIP (Feline Infection Peritonitis),"Meet [Flynn](https://imgur.com/a/MYbt4Zw)  


Our little 5 months old Flynn was diagnosed with Feline Infectious Peritonitis on December 18th, 2019. The disease is usually fatal and, in Flynn's cases, causes fever, lack of appetite, lethargy and a build-up of fluids in the abdomen. If not treated, he could developpe more symptoms such as neurological and eye issues, and ultimately death. We had exams done in addition to a complete bloodwork panel and radios taken, along with a consult from another veterinarian to confirm his diagnosis.

While there is officially no cure, there has been some very new and promising clinical trials done this year (so most vet, unfortunately, do not know about it yet because it is so new) with GS441, with a survival rate above 80% (on a nearly fatal disease), so there is hope for our little guy! We got in touch with a group of veterinarians that are giving access to a couple of new drugs such as Mutian, Blossom, Shire, Miner, and Ajax, which are made to treat FIP and have an incredible success rate. However, it is not yet FDA approved (the company shows no interest in doing so because there aren't enough profits in felines) so it is fairly hard and expensive to get your hands on. Our personal vet was however very interested in the studies and asked me to email her all of my finds.

We decided to give it a try anyway after joining a wonderful support group all fighting against FIP and most have amazing recoveries. Everything is overlooked by volunteer vets, and they are more than helpful and supportive.

We decided to go for Mutian, since it is more accessible in Canada (only one in stock currently too) and has an incredible 95% survival rate. However, the treatment is incredibly expensive and will cost well over $4000 CAD, in addition to our current vet bill for the diagnosis and additional blood tests that will have to be done during the treatment. We are struggling to gather all of that money so we are now turning to you, incredible people of Reddit, to help us save our little rescue angel.

,This wounded lion can't find his pride.,"(link at bottom of post)

Regarding the headline, my name translates to ""a lion with heart"" from Persian.

So basically, I'm a man with what is termed high functioning autism who is too young to be going through all this. This is just the latest thing to happen in what's been a string of catastrophe upon catastrophe, and I'm not being hyperbolic. Previous events mostly being irrelevant however, let's just stay with the issue at hand. Walking upstairs on October 24th, I suddenly ceased walking and was treated to a very fast and somewhat uncomfortable trip back downstairs. Later I learned that what caused my legs to lose feeling and function had been a benign tumor on my spine, which moved some things around and caused severe nerve damage. At first I had no feeling or motion at all from my nipples to my toe tipples. (I couldn't help it, sorry.) I've regained a lot of the sensation and I'm able to move my legs somewhat again but it's not known if they will ever bear weight reliably again, and even if they do that doesn't change the fact that I'm left without support or income, and I've been responsible not only for myself but also, unwisely, for my partner (more about that later) who is also on the autism spectrum. And as if to add insult to injury, the day i was released from the hospital (despite serious concerns on my part) I was also struck with Bell's Palsy which has made it such that I can't speak clearly or move the entire right side of my face and it's looking like one of the 30 percent of cases that don't go away. . 

I've had to leave where I was living in Portland and move in with someone I barely know except from political groups on Facebook and it's been difficult, especially because the nearby city I live in now is horrible as far as accessibility. The person my partner and I live with has made it clear to me that she will throw me out on a whim. And I can't even make it to the bus stop alone due to sidewalks frequently existing only in the barest sense of the name. And alone is how I need to be able to do things, because my partner who was meant to be my caretaker as he agreed, does not take care of anything. He hasnt tried to look for a job, and has helped himself to a large part of what friends and family donated and please don't tell me how dumb I've been because I know. He doesn't help with housework and neither does the leaseholder and unless I want to live in filth I have to clean everything alone. I thought I knew him and I've never minded helping him but i can't carry the weight anymore and today he left me in the cold rain in my wheelchair half a mile from home after screaming at me because I asked him if it would be alright if we didn't after all spend my last 16 dollars on a pair of headphones because he can't wait four days for the ones he ordered to arrive in the mail. And this is just the same pattern it's always been but I can no longer absorb it because my body is a traitor. 

Anyway, I have no family. My father passed away last August and he was the only one. I had moved to Oregon as a life change and for better opportunity with the sort of thing I studied in school, and what with taking care of my partner financially and emotionally I've had no time. I've shared on Facebook a lot and people have been great but I'm not a cute kid or a veteran or a puppy; just a grumpy academic and classical musician with a love for foul language and obscure records, and some serious issues that need immediate addressing. 

The funds left.to raise will be going to me, and me only, and will be used to rent somewhere for a bit while working on my disability case, and trying to learn how to take care of myself again, and for food, and potential purchase of transportation able to accommodate a chair. I own literally nothing anymore except the guitar my dad gave me last holiday, and it's all I have that I can remember him with. Im no softie. I've had a rough life. But this is too much for anyone and I am utterly, completely without any help or support. Please share this or donate if you're able. Any questions are welcome if clarification or evidence is necessary. I just want to feel like I have some agency again, and I'm worried that falsehoods and vindictive behavior might end up with me in a wet cold winter and a chair out in the street.

Basically the reason is that they are living with someone who is  a real asshole to his daughter. They stood up for her, it came to  a huge fight, and they got an eviction notice hours later and now have one month to find something.   They have applied for housing, but that was before this happened. They are trying to speed up the process, but either way they will need funds to help with the move. They thought they have enough time to be prepared,  but this eviction came out of the blue, and now they need help fast. I really hope reddit can help them out of this predicament, they really deserve some help. They are very good people, who are in a bad situation.

I have never felt more helpless in my entire life.

This same time last year, I was living in a hostel with 11 other roommates because it was the cheapest option available considering I was living off of what little savings I'd had after being homeless for three months. I was only 18, and it was honestly the hardest thing I'd ever had to manage, which is saying a lot considering I've been financially and legally independent since I was 16. I managed to land a pretty great job that paid well enough and I even saved up enough to get out of the hostel by this past May. The problem is, this summer, my hours for that job have slowly become less and less. It's now at the point where I worked one day in two weeks. I don't think they're intending to let me go, I'm just needed less. Obviously before it got so bad, I'd started the job search and recently managed to land a second job. But, financially, the damage was done, and I was unable to pay rent for November.

My roommates have been understanding so far, and they've given me a tentative date of January 3rd to pay both November and December, but since I started this job that pays bi-weekly on an ""off week"" and the holidays are coming up where I won't be paid at all, I'm kind of fucked. I have half of the money I need for rent, but I won't have all of it.

If I don't pay by January 3rd, I will be homeless. I just don't want to be homeless during the coldest and harshest conditions of the year where I live. I'm only asking for a little help to get me back on my feet during these hard times. I just need some support. I'm also going to include a link to my deviantart where I'm willing to do commissions in exchange for donations. Thank you in advance.

,My friend is in need of an electric wheelchair,"Hello Redditors of this subreddit. While this campaign does not directly affect my own life, this affects one of my close friends. 

Suffering from multiple progressive diseases since a young age, like Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, my friend had been relying on their service dog Atlas prior to attending university. However, as they have grown older, these disabilities have caused their joints to become loose and arthritic, which hinders their movement and safety further, and Atlas cannot provide enough support any longer. 

This hindrance not only affects their ability to attend their biology and chemistry courses, but it genuinely affects their freedom in general movement tremendously. After intensive research and suggestions from medical personnel, they have made a decision to utilize an electric wheelchair, specifically the Permobil M3 Corpus, as it possesses elevation features and technology that alleviates the hindrance to properly attend courses and fulfill even the most basic tasks around campus and in their community. 

If you could, please donate to their cause and aid them in having that freedom again. However, if you are unable to do so, sharing the campaign around would be greatly appreciated. Not only will this improve their life, but it will make me very joyful to see them succeed as a student and future veterinary nutritionist, even with the limitations.

,My father broke his leg. He has been off work for weeks and has run out of PTO. He does not have short-term disability.," I have also posted this on r/charity. Please let me know if that is not allowed.

Asking for help is never easy, but sometimes it’s gotta be done. My family and I are asking for donations for my parents for medical costs and cost of living

A few months ago, my dad was at a friend’s house, walking outside. He slipped and fell, and his leg bent the wrong way and broke. He broke both his fibula and tibia. Since about mid-October, he has been totally home-bound. He can’t leave the house for work, as my parents live in a split level house. For the first two months, he was not allowed to put an ounce of weight on his foot. He's now able to put some weight on it, but he is still in a boot and only able to move around with the help of a walker.

My mother had to stay home with him for about two months. She only had two weeks worth of PTO to get them by, with the help of my dad's PTO. She is now back at work while she maintains the household and cares for my dad.

There have already been numerous costs associated with the adjustment. Thankfully, my hardworking father had over 200 hours of PTO saved up, which is just shy of 5 weeks’ worth. However, we’re short of what we need. He’s potentially home bound until January 15th (for 12 weeks total), assuming all goes well. He may not be walking normally again until well into the new year. He does not qualify for social security disability, and he has neither short-term disability insurance nor accident insurance.

The hospital bills have yet to roll in. My dad’s recovery has included multiple visits to the doctor, one cast, one boot, and one surgery to put a bar and 5 screws into his leg. We’re really just waiting now for the official total (so the total goal may raise), and we know we’re going to need your help.

Growing up, my parents were essentially everyone's parents. Each and every friend my brother and I brought through the door were immediately adopted under their wings and given a chair around our dinner table. We ate dinner together as a family every single night, and our friends were no exception to that rule. Each and every friend was probably given a lecture or two about something or the other, but they were also met with great big bear hugs and lots of love, no matter their choices and opinions.

My parents have given so much love over the years. They continue to do so every day. They have done everything they can to give my brother and I every opportunity to succeed, explore, and learn. They have been an ear I've talked off about high school, college, and now adult woes. They have been my stability and my strength when I have struggled or floundered. They have always been our #1 cheerleaders, reminding us every day that we can do anything if we put in the work, that we are capable of greatness and of kindness, and that we are the most stellar children we can be to them.

They have reminded me time and time again about just how much I have to give to the world and how much strength I have inside of me as I charge (or sometimes crawl) through every obstacle life has thrown my way. They have been my strength and my reason for carrying on when I have felt like I no longer could.

I want so desperately to give every ounce of that love back to them and tell them thank you. I wish I could scoop them up into my arms and tell them each and every bill has been paid by the magic of the internet. Please help me make that possible for them.

We have raised a total of $870 with the addition of checks that have come in. If you have not received a handwritten thank you note from me, please send me a message, because I truly want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping my family.

,Me and My girlfriend got disowned and need help,"Hey everyone! 


My girlfriend and I have been disowned by her parents this week and are reaching out desperately for financial support. This is her goFundme message:

My name is Rachel and I am currently a junior at Colorado State University and I'm studying accounting and history. I'm hoping to be able to finish my undergraduate degree in accounting to help me go into law school to pursue corporate or tax law. Unfortunately though, I recently had a falling out with my parents who used to help me pay the up-front tuition bills since it is hard for me to take thousands out of my savings at one time. They no longer associate with me because I am moving in with my boyfriend of two years and they believe it is immoral and a bad path. I have also been struggling with a lot of health issues with my heart this semester, which have made it harder for me to work consistent hours being in and out of the hospital. Now that I don't have a support system, I can't afford my medical bills and my tuition in January. If I could receive even a little bit of support I would really appreciate it, I don't necessarily need the whole sum! It's always been my dream to go to law school, as you can see that is me in high school lettering in speech and debate! :) I'm really hoping to receive help to stay in school and also get my health back on track, I would appreciate anything that I could get! Thank you so much even for just reading this, any support means the world to me. I am a very dedicated student and have had five internships already. I currently have two jobs and would not take any help that I receive for granted. Thank you!!!

,Raising money for a headstone/grave marker for my son,"My son will be 3 years old in February. He passed away 8 minutes after being born due to a shoulder dystocia and oxygen deprivation. We were very lucky to have the burial plot donated to us by the cemetery. However, the cemetery requires bronze on granite stones for their baby garden and the cost is phenomenal to us. 

Here's the text copied from the GFM my wife set up:

>Enzo was born on February 21st 2017. He weighed 10lbs,  was 22 inches long and had a head full of beautiful hair.  
>  
>Enzo  has a shoulder dystocia and became stuck during delivery. From the time  he became stuck to the time her was born was only 8 minutes and during  that time the cord collapsed and my uterus ruptured. The combination  caused oxygen deprivation to set in rapidly and he asphyxiated as a  result.  
>  
>We still haven’t been able to get the money together for a  headstone for him and it doesn’t seem like we’d be able to any time  soon.   
>  
>He currently has a little garden stone as a marker but  it’s wearing down rapidly and I would to be able to order a headstone  by his 3rd birthday.   
>  
>The cemetery has requirements for  headstones and as a result, an inexpensive granite stone is not an  option (that’s what we were initially going to purchase but then they  told us we couldn’t have that there.).  
>  
>I’m setting our goal at  $4000 to account for the cost of the headstone, the installation, and  the fees on here. Any money raised that is left over would be used to  make Bereavement Boxes to gift to local, newly bereaved loss families.

,"Mother takes in two kittens found in dumpster, major vascular tumor forms on leg, mother pays for the procedure on credit card and sets retirement back."," 

[https://www.gofundme.com/f/skye039s-surgery-and-hospital-stay?utm\_source=customer&utm\_medium=copy\_link&utm\_campaign=p\_cp+share-sheet](https://www.gofundme.com/f/skye039s-surgery-and-hospital-stay?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet)

All   of the story is in there. He has healed up great and he's back to    being  a cat with the biggest personality ever.  I tried being thorough    as  possible in the story. If anyone wants to see statements from the   vet or discover or whatever, it can be provided. You can talk to my    mother or I on the phone if you would like to. There are pictures in the  gofundme of the veterinary clinic bill, and would gladly give credit  card statements to anyone who is inquiring.

It's   not an emergency necessarily. It's on a credit card and my mom has a  lot of credit, but she's already far behind where she should be    retirement  wise. She is 63, and is going to have to work for something  like 4-5  more years before she has a livable wage. There was a   divorce,  I went through some mental health/addiction things and she   helped me with rehab  a few times, which, has finally paid off as I have   over 1 year clean from substances...heroin, methamphetamine,  benzos,  alcohol, etc. I use CBD/THC tincture for sleep and that's it.  She has  always had my back through everything in life that I struggled  with. If  this  bill could just go away, that would be great. I've  started   dumping as much as I can into the house payments with her to  hope she  can retire earlier, but we'll have to see.

My   mother works 40+ hours a week at a ""Christian Company"" that works them  pretty hard on very hard floors. She used to be able to wear crocs,   which helped, but they banned them and according to her she's been   unable to find shoes that can help. She comes home with swollen ankles   and limps up the stairs, one stair at a time, in order to get upstairs   and crawl into bed to do it again the next day.

It   absolutely breaks my heart when I get home from working at a moving  company and think, ""damn I'm sore"" and then she gets home from the same   length shift at hobby lobby and it takes 3 minutes to get up the  stairs.  It's destroying her body. If I had only been able to clean up  my life a  few years earlier, she might be in a better position for  retirement.  I'm doing amazing now, but I never made success and my  wages only help  so much. I figure I owe her at least 15k before I am  remotely squared up  with her, and I will be paying that and supporting  her for the rest of  her life, as she has done for me. I believe with my  constant dumping as  much money as possible onto her house mortgage,  and being able to pay  down her credit card so she can work on the house  as well, it might be  possible to shave a couple years off of working  so she is able to  retire.

Also, I  know that there  are many people dealing with death, loss, terminal  illnesses, etc. I  know my life isn't bad. I love my life. I  would just  love to not see my  mom suffer for the next 5 years and be in  tears  when she walks. And  good ol' Wisconsin can't pass medicinal the most  helpful thing for her  pain.

Any other questions, comments, or ideas of ways I can get help for her/myself, please let me know.

Skye is healthy and active as ever, running around in the house with   the other cats and having the time of his life. I'll upload a couple videos of him playing at some point. He's been a happy boy since recovery.

,Please consider helping Virginie and her family with her medical expenses,"One of my friend's has the most wonderful sister and family, and they are struggling to keep up with medical expenses. Here's an excerpt from the GoFundMe page: 

>Virginie has been poked and prodded more times than I can count and has suffered from crippling pain for much too long. All I wish for my sister is to be able to have the remaining surgeries she needs in order to function more or less like a “normal” human being.  
  
>  
>Truthfully, she’s missed enough of her teenage years and nearly all of her 20’s. She has so much to offer this world and I know she wants to dedicate her journey to helping others also suffering through chronic disease. 

V needs multiple surgeries for her medical conditions. Her intestines are malformed to the point the surgeon wouldn’t feel it safe to perform all he needs to do in just one surgery because it would put too much physical stress on her body... Especially because Lyme disease already weakens her body’s ability to recover normally.

To add more insult to injury, Virginie will also need a separate surgery to perform a Fundoplication which is a surgical method for treating gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Not only does GERD cause her to vomit foods/drinks she just consumed back into her mouth… it also causes inflammation, pain, and can lead to serious complications (such as scarring and stricture) of the esophagus. Her constant state of inflammation also elevates her LDL cholesterol which poses other problems. 

Any help you can give by donating or sharing V's story would be a huge help. Thank you so much for reading.

,My mom has stage 4 cancer,"Happy holidays everyone

My only wish this year is to get help for my mom and I. 

As a lot of you know, Lenis went for an exploratory surgery back in April this year, due to cysts around her ovaries. However, the final diagnosis was a rare cancer of the appendix with a complication of pseudomyxoma, and it is at stage 4. 

After going to several consultations, she got a referral for Dr. Armando Sardi, who is considered to be one of the best doctors to use Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) to treat late-stage abdominal cancer. 

In November, Lenis traveled to Baltimore, where she underwent the 11-12 hour procedure on Thursday, Nov. 21. After over three weeks of being in the hospital, she is now back home in Orlando to continue her journey to recovery. 

Because of her diagnosis, Lenis has been unable to work since April, which has caused significant financial strain on her family. On top of basic expenses including rent, bills, and food, her family had to pay out of pocket to stay in a hotel nearby the hospital in Baltimore while she recovered, which was over $3,000. Additionally, they are still unsure what they will have to pay out of pocket for her recent procedure. 

Any contribution, no matter how small, would mean so much to Lenis and her family as she focuses on healing. As mentioned, this money will support their basic living expenses and costs from her surgery.

Thank you so much for your prayers, love, and support.

I was diagnosed with shingles, but with a whole slew of complications. I was basically paralyzed on the left side of my body for almost a week, the day after I got out, I was sent back. I have h.pylori and some other real fun stomach stuff.

This set me back. Bad.

I was able to borrow a small amount of money from my parents to cover my rent for this month, but now, I owe close to 3,000$ in medical bills. 

I made a gofundme hoping to get close to half, or honestly anything to help me get these paid. I don't know what else to do, or where else to go. I'm drowning in bills and I don't have a way out.

,Please help Veteran having 4th surgery and really needing help.,"[Go Fund Me](https://gf.me/u/wnndcp)

Hi everyone,

It's Christmas time and I know for most people this is the time of the year that people enjoy but for some reason Christmas has never been too kind to me. I am 33 years old and have been having problems with hernia mesh since I got out of the military when I was 22. I had a basic hernia surgery and the doctors put this mesh inside of me that has now been recalled by the federal government. Just this past week I found out that I have a nerve tumor in the site of my previous 3 surgeries which will require surgery to be removed and they tell me possibly fixed. I have zero faith in this procedure because I have 3 failures to make me have this reservation. I am absolutely broke. I haven't been able to work at all this year because of constant medical treatment and the bills have reached such a height that it's not even worth knowing the debt. Right now I'm more concerned about daily life like eating, bills, ect. I wanted to start a new life and that was my original Go Fund Me but right now I'm so screwed because I am practically homeless and have no car and just feel like I have nothing. My family is pretty much non existent and I just really beg and plead for a miracle. ANYTHING would help me through this situation right now. I really need help from somewhere and it just seems like religion forgot about me. I have had nothing constant pain and medical failures in my adult life. It's robbed me of happiness, my youth, and just anything resembling a quality of life. I joined the Air Force right out of high school and graduating early. I immediately ran into this health problem after I got out and do not have any veteran benefits despite having a honorable discharge. 

I know it's a difficult time of the year to be asking for charity but I really am someone that needs it right now. I am so close to giving up and someone helping me out could make a huge difference and give me some kind of belief that I can make it through. Please donate or share this. I am not special and not more deserving than some of the stories I've read on here but I am desperate and really in need of some kind of hope in life. My life has felt like a constant forest fire just trying to put out a tree at a time but not getting ahead. I really hope that maybe a miracle happens and I can get through this and have some kind of a family and career after this. PLEASE HELP ME and I will forever be grateful to you. 

Thank you and enjoy this holiday season."

,Please help my friend while he's fighting for Disability.,"Hi guys,

  
Turning to you in hopes for any help at all. My  very dear friend Bastion is battling for Disability in Florida. He's diabetic, mostly blind in one eye, and struggling with a slew of mental health and physical complications that have made holding a job long term very difficult (hence seeking Disablity). However, Florida is hell. He doesn't qualify for medicaid there, even though he has zero income. His life partner is struggling with a different set of concerns. They have three years of back taxes on their home owed, though they've been trying their hardest to make ends meet with savings and investments, those have about reached their end.   


I have the [tax bill](https://i.imgur.com/ad5AlA6.png), the [car assessment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ENhjmfNxZpySqfV821xhyk0R8SMtkual/view?usp=sharing), and I've got a potato-quality picture of one of the places the [ceiling and roof need repaired](https://i.imgur.com/AFrNj7H.jpg), if anyone wants evidence (the plastic in that pic covers a giant hole that leaks moldy water every time it rains. The dark splotches on the wall above it are where the mold colony is spreading). They also have two cats who need some care, those details are in the GFM, along with pictures of all four of their beautiful furballs.  


Anway.... any help at all would be an incredible boon. I know the goal seems lofty but about 3/4 of that will go to outstanding bills, taxes, etc, and the rest to things like buying groceies, pet food, and dr's appointments because lack of health insurance means lack of doctors, even for really important problems.  


Thank you so much for even reading this far, if you have,

,Colombian International Student in Canada about to be deported mere months before finishing university,"Hi there everyone. I am trying to help a friend of mine who is facing down some really big problems right now. Neither of us are the best when it comes to social media so please bear with me.

Paula and I both work in the film industry in Vancouver BC, and she is something else. She came from Colombia to Canada to study and join our film industry. She has somehow managed to work up to 3+ jobs at once AND go to Capilano University where she is absolutely kicking ass in one of the top film programs in the country. I have not met many people who can hope to match how determined she is and has proven herself to be.

That all being said, Paula needs our help.

\*\*You can follow her story on the GoFundMe link below, if you would prefer a primary description of events.\*\*

Paula is staring down having to leave Canada (and her education) soon despite being very close to graduating (April). Due to political unrest and financial issues related to the economy at home in Colombia, and despite doing everything a person in her position could do to pay her own way, she needs to raise A LOT of tuition money very quickly (by the end of December) if she wants to continue with her career and life here - which I assure you is in the best interests of everybody fortunate enough to have the opportunity to get to know her (much less work with her, holy cow). She also had someone hack her facebook earlier this week to try and steal what she has already raised, so she could use a break :/

I think Paula’s situation is incredibly unfortunate, and the scale of her conviction to overcome it is something unique.

I’d be hard-pressed to name another cause that deserves your support more than this one right now, because honestly Paula embodies a certain type of spirit and determination that doesn’t come around every day.

Whether you can donate or you know another way to help, this is one of those rare occasions where you can truly feel certain that you are doing something positive - not just for Paula, but for Canada honestly. She deserves to be here, and trust me when I say that we as Canadians want what she brings to the table when it comes to work ethic and creativity. She isn’t even asking for the full amount, cause she’s freaking crazy determined to do it with or without us.

I’d like it to be with us. She’s the definition of a hard-working Canadian. So help me help her, let’s show her how Canada gets down when someone fights this hard and needs our help.

If you are Canadian, or you understand what I mean, then this one is for you.

,Trying to stay positive and hopeful,"

I have tried this GoFundMe thing once before, I didn’t get very far and as I have limited family and no actual friends or social media I have found it very hard to reach out to people and ask for help even as I hate doing so, I was always the one with my hand out to others mainly my family....now I just been stuck on the other end.

Fast version is in 2018 I lost two of my closest family members, my grandmother and uncle both from CHF I did all I could to help in every way, including financially which really put me in a bad spot but I don’t regret that. I had a job so bills were paid, credit was being stretched then I lost my job at the college I attended and my credit carried me some as well as some odds and ends jobs. Sold just about all I could on eBay to just float by hoping to get stable work but that has not been fruitful. 

My original GoFundMe was to help with bills and my debt, that has come and passed now getting lawsuits threats and endless calls. Winter is here really and the cold is setting in, I need to get  $500  fast which I’m hopeless to think I can get that in such a short time, trying not to lose heat and have my pipes freeze. Eh the link to my GoFundMe is here if anyone feels it is worth giving, I am not currently dying and see so many others in need it is just sad. I am so tired and stressed, I have thought of going to the borrow sub here but being honest I highly doubt someone would lend money to someone knowing that I could not pay back anytime soon if at all and I would clearly state that if I posted. I been scammed before and it is not a good feeling, more so when in need, so please no DM saying you have an opportunity for me just to try and take or use me, really can’t handle that stuff right now.

I have some savings, but it isn’t enough for the continued care of my grandpa, the funeral and keeping the bills paid. Any kind of help is greatly appropriated. My mom and I really need it.

,I am stranded and need some help.,"My name is Brion. My life has been something of a mess. I currently live in hawaii and I have been trying to go home back to Texas with my favorite person Zella for over 6 months. I have been going through a very nasty divorce. I haven't been able to find a job in over a year, I've applied to every place that I'm even remotely qualified to work. I've gotten a few interviews but never a call back. Due to this divorce I've spent almost every penny I have, I've sustained myself on doing handy man work which isnt enough to pay for food and rent. I've burned through my entire savings account. The divorce has been finalized and I can go home now, but I can't afford a ticket to go home.  Any help getting home would mean a lot to me, when I do get home I'm going to be in a difficult situation also. I have several employers lined up but it will still take time to get my first paycheck. I know that it's Christmas and everyone is broke but anything helps.  Thank you for your compassion

My nephew needs all the help he can get. For over 10 years he has been having stomach trouble. Various doctors have all missed that underlying this has been cancer all along. It recently went from stage 3 to stage 4.

He has just started a new life, with a beautiful fiancée and has always been there for our family and his friends. His treatment is going to commence soon however the funds for this are not yet adequate. Any help GOES A LONG LONG WAY. We need your help and he needs your help.

,Emergency Vet Visit Fees for Special Needs Cat,"[here's a photo of my boy, smushy, after coming home today](https://imgur.com/a/5IN9dkz) he's still in some pain and we've been giving him painkillers prescribed by the emergency vet

my mom and I have fostered cats since 2012 and often end up keeping the special needs ones because they aren't considered very adoptable by potential pet owners. smoosh/smushy (my mom and I don't agree on how to spell his name) suffered a severe fever as a kitten that has affected his ability to walk and causes him to get frequent urinary blockages even while on a special diet to prevent it. it tends to be a yearly occurance but he's usually gets them on weekdays so he can see his normal vet.

this weekend we caught him in the throes of another urinary infection and took him to the emergency vet to be treated since his normal vet was closed. the bill ended up being quite costly (a little over $1100). he had a second visit to his normal vet but we have not included that cost in the fundraiser bc we haven't been billed yet. while we had a carecredit to cover it, the money was planned to treat my mother's teeth, since she needs several pulled. it would really help both smoosh's health and my mom's health for any little bit.

[here is a link to the fundraiser, albeit it's on facebook and not gofundme, I didn't get a say hah](https://www.facebook.com/donate/461684404532331/2539124009696190/)

I can send a picture of the emergency vet bill to a mod if needed

EDIT 12/19/2019-- unfortunately, smushy relapsed and went into full kidney failure. as he was suffering quite a bit and there was no guarantee the treatment to jumpstart his kidney function would work, we opted to let him go before he got any worse. i'll be leaving the post up just in case anyone comes along and wants to donate, as we now have extra fees for that vet visit as well as his cremation. anything will be appreciated."

,A dear friend committed suicide. He was the primary provider for his wife and toddler.,"Recently a friend chose to take his own life. It surprised everyone close to him. 
I was very close to both Dekota and Tashi. I watched them fall in love and get married. Then they started a family. Once they had Daeliana, Tashi decided to primarily be the care taker. She’s mostly a stay at home mom. Some evening she’ll work part time at a restaurant near their home. To say she’s not financially prepared at this moment would be a understatement. She has applied for all the government programs that they qualify for. But of course that leaves many things without right now. 

Tashi is such a strong lady. She’s resilient and adaptable. She’d never ask for help herself. But she just needs a little extra love through this holiday season. 

Anything helps. Even if it’s just a share of their GoFundMe link. 

Much love

,"Desperate and scared.. Financially ruined from a undiagnosed developmental disorder, and the resulting exponentially mounting setbacks and struggles as a result.","Since I was a young child, I've had Asperger's or some other form of autism. I was never diagnosed as such, and, as a result, I was never treated as such. I was just diagnosed with ADHD (which I do and did have, though it was much more than that), and, therefore, I was treated with every medication in the book for ADHD, but nothing seemed to work. I never got any real help - just sent to boarding school, on my own dime.  


Having finally come to know who I am, I can now move forward. I know that there are countless options and opportunities for me, I just need to choose the right path, specific to me. I want to get my PMP (Project Management Professional) certification, so I can finally contribute to a company in the way I know I can.  


The problem is, I still have all the financial damage caused by all of these problems that my disorders have caused me. I've had so many jobs, because I don't have the certifications or degrees to qualify for the job I'd like (though I do have all the training), because I was never able to focus in school or university. I do have severe ADHD, and cannot learn in a normal classroom setting (fidget cubes are a wonder).  


A symptom of my situation is a bad case of procrastination. By not having addressed my issues, and ways to get help, I have accumulated considerable debt, and a freelance job I was expecting payment from has closed and filed for bankruptcy, so I am not getting paid, and now, by the beginning of the year, I will be homeless.  


I have begun seeking and accepting help in my condition, but I just can't get out of this financial hole I'm stuck in. My leaves me with a degree of apathy, and I am just not fazed by my predicaments, until the last moment. If I can get out of this hole, I can see what it's like to be a person (for the first time)..

,My best friend's dad has developed cancer again.,"Dear Reddit,

My best friend since middle school's father has developed prostate cancer. My friend has given so selflessly for so long to his family from his own income, as his family was dependent on his dad's income growing up. His father already had to overcome sarcoma a few years ago and it destroyed their savings to do it.

My friend is not the type to ever post anything asking for help unless they desperately needed it, as they are not the type of people who want to make their problems known.

,Problem with dog leads to broken hand,"We had a boxer mix rescue dog named Buddy. He started out great, but we quickly found he had issues with our kids. He’d snap at them without warning, or without cause. One day, he launched himself across our patio at my daughter without warning, knocked her down, and split her lip. We were told time and time again, this behavior could be fixed. This all lead up to him snapping at my daughter for what felt like the hundredth time. The trick we using at the time to try to break it was crating him, and we had already decided we were giving him up but we’re just waiting for the right family to show. Well, I grabbed him by his collar to lead him inside and put him in his crate. He turned on me and attacked me. During the struggle to safely get him in the crate without hurting anyone, I broke my hand (I suppose I should count myself lucky that was the worst of it). Where we live, we can’t get health insurance. We have applied and applied and applied, but everyone keeps telling us no. The first surgery I had wiped us out of everything we had saved up and the surgeons office told us it “covered everything”. One week later, I get an $870 bill from the anesthesiologist. And then I’m told I need to lay another $10k to get the pins removed from my hand. I don’t have this money. With these pins in, I can’t let anything touch my hand. It HURTS! Not to mention it causes the pin to tear through my skin (putting me at risk for infection). I have minimal movement of my hand due to the placement of the pins (I can’t bend the bottom knuckle of my pinky finger, and have little range of motion in my wrist). The inability to use my hand has made it difficult for me to interact with my kids the same way I did before, and it makes simply daily tasks a chore. Just the slightest bump of my hand can cause extreme pain and the pin to rip through my skin again. I would be extremely grateful if anyone can help me in any way they can, be it sharing my link or even donating a dollar! please and thank you!

,Help my mom get a wedding dress,"Here’s the story: About a month ago, my mom expressed to me she went over to my grandparent’s house to let them know she’s engaged (she is 51 and this is her first wedding btw) and was telling them details about her plans for the wedding. Her parents scoffed and asked her why she even “needs to have a wedding at all” because “she’s too old”. It made her feel horrible to the point she was crying to me as she told me. It broke my heart because my mom doesn’t deserve to be shamed for wanting to celebrate her special day, regardless of however old she is. She doesn’t deserve to feel embarrassed and shamed that she found someone later in life either. Who cares if she’s 51, she deserves to be a bride. I’ve seen my mom date so many horrible, abusive men in the past and now I can confidently say she’s found her true love and Prince Charming. My mom is the most selfless, kind, generous woman I know. She’s always taking care of everybody else but doesn’t receive that energy back from her loved ones. They’re getting married in August. So to show her she deserves to feel special, I’m surprising my mom with some money to get her a wedding dress. I’m a 22 year old broke college student but I’ve pitched in as well. I’ve put up fliers around campus for it, shared on social media, and I’m even collaborating with two friends to help me raise money as well.

Hello everyone! This gofundme is to take my high school theatre troupe to state competitions. Our school hasn’t had a theatre program in like 20 years. The only reason we have one now is because my theatre teacher has worked so hard to build the program from the ground up over the course of about 5 years now. We are still very underfunded because we’re from a country bumpkin Florida town that only cares about football. This year, we took our show to competitions and have been given the opportunity to go to states! the only issue is that it is $140 per person. We are a title one school and like I said, very underfunded. There are so many talented and amazing people in my troupe and I just want everyone to have everything they deserve. If you can, please donate to our troupe so we can get there. Thank you so much!!!!

Meet my friend Babs. This woman, while only in my life for a short time, has already made it obvious is one of the most selfless and loving people I've ever known. Her mother has recently passed after a long battle with diabetes, alzheimers, and a double leg amputation. She was forced to quit her job to care for her mum's very extensive medical needs, with neither of her sisters willing to pitch in and help. She took care of her mum's every need for three years, picking up odd jobs here and there for a bit of income, and then, without warning, her mum passed the second week of October. She risks losing her home, her mother's dream home, due to being so far behind on payments.

,Startup Math and Physics channel,"Hi my name is Connor and I am a struggling student and worker with a long story so bare with it. I want to make a career in teaching Mathematics and Physics to everyone here on youtube or wherever I can.  My goal was to be an electrician but due to my low rank interview score due to my nervousness, I am stuck without a career while at the same time really struggling financially to make my apartment, car, insurance, and internet payments every month. I am extremely hard worker and for a career, I used to clean rental cars, did Lyft every night, now do Grubhub and still do, along with College tutor at community college but thats only per semester.  Now since this semester is over, I am forced to do grubhub again, normally which I wouldnt mind since I love working, the issue is I hate driving because I have to deal with every day reckless drivers, being tailgated, nearly got hit by intersection, people who blatantly disregard for road safety which makes it very stressful of my life to the point where I used to work 5 days 7 hours a week to now just one day or two. I live in a city where we have the worst drivers so I end getting a dashcam for my protection so all this stuff I have video footages on. The whole point of all this is that I am hustling it and really dont want to have to drive anymore. On top of financial issues I have to deal with personal backstabbing friends and family issues. Long story short is I grew up orphaned without a proper family been isolated and hurt which left me to the point of not want to be int he city anymore.

The whole point here is that I am struggling financial and emotional at the same time to the point where I am not sure if I even want to continue school at this point, or at least not at this college. I have been hustling of trying to build my life and did had this channel up for a while but could not have time to work on it till now. This is why I started the gofundme, so I can have the opportunity to reach out to people across the world and teach them so they wouldn't struggle with math anymore. I have just finished taking E&M class which ive learned all the Math and Physics tools there is. I plan to do lots of things with this channel, I plan to organizes a google classroom that covers Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus, and Linear, For physics I plan to cover Mechanics, different types of waves, thermal, optics, relativity, and big time E&M.  

If donated, it would extremely help not just me but the struggling students as well. I have done and will do again a live tutor session here on you tube where students can pop in online, ask questions. It would make my charity that much more enjoyable. If you guys have any questions, feel free to send me a text, I can back up everything I say and my life is an open book if your curious. Help this small channel grow.

,"[REQUEST] Semester just started, laptop charger broke","[US]

Kind of a long shot; I'm usually the one lurks behind the scenes and upvotes posts. Took me a lot of courage to post this here. I'm hopelessly on the edge with funds (college senior) and the new semester brought along with itself a new set of tough classes, opportunities to learn but also a nasty surprise. My computer's charger cable (which was 4+ years old) gave up on me last night. I'm posting this from the library computer because my laptop's battery is down and the only way I can get it to work is borrow a charger cable from the library  - which I can get for 3 hours max/day.


I know it seems like too much but I have a Dell Laptop and a new one on Amazon goes upto 25 bucks. Dunno if anyone will read this but it your help would be immensely appreciated and would really help me out because with off-campus rent, food and books - every single penny counts. Have a nice sunday yall!

,[request] I need help finding a used iPad for art purposes.,"I just need some help finding lower priced iPads that are Apple Pencil compatible and can use procreate.

I’m really just hoping for site recommendations. I don’t have many art connections in my real life, and I figured it’s always better to ask the internet!"
,[Request] I really need a new art tablet,Im in need of a new art tablet. My first ever tablet was a small wacom and it lasted for almost 3 years but on Wednesday it finally gave out. I used my art tablet for a lot of school work and at home jobs but I no longer have one and am too broke to get a new one. Any help is welcomed.
,[Request] A life essential and/or a sleep aid (UK),"Hey there kind people. This is my second attempt at this post. It was auto-removed yesterday because I said the P-word\* which you'll see in the first paragraph. Dang it bot, I wasn't asking for the stuff! I was mentioning it!

Anyway. Long time lurker (4+ years, longer than had this account) and first time poster. (Context: I was starving, foodless and broke one day, found random acts of peetza\*, found this place, lurked to admire ever since.)

I've been trying to find something to offer for years but every time I find it, life gets in the way. I wanted to have a few things offered up in case one day I had something I needed and had to ask for. But I swear, one day when my dang website is up and running, I'll post here offering services from it. (Creative services - just saying ""services"" sounds questionable.)

Sadly the time has come that there are two items I desperately need, I have very little money and the stars have aligned for me to gain a ton of comment karma today which pushed me the next 100 over the edge into eligible. (Well, over 2k over the edge actually ... people really like this one comment about Richard Noggin.) Anyway.

I'm currently in a transitional period between giving up freelance video editing in favour of a reliable freelance writing client. The pay is almost the same (tragically, but that's a whole other post in a whole other subreddit) but it pays monthly. The video editing paid weekly.

I don't get paid until February 15th and currently all the money I have is accounted for. There's food money, WiFi money and the money I have to use to replace money from my medical fund for procedures I can't get on the NHS. I had to spend all of the money I had saved on my dog. He was hit by a car a month ago, but he's fine now. No internal injuries but a lot of stitches, antibiotics and a whole thing where the first vet was SO BAD I had to take him to another one to fix the damage done by the first. (The first vet was so useless he could've lost his leg because they didn't clean it or bandage it AND they gave him drains he didn't need. I knew it as soon as I got him home and took him to a different vet the next day, who confirmed my suspicions.)

~~But anyway - I have a hospital appointment (and even more after it) this month. And I'm out of one of my essentials. And I can't afford to buy more. I need to use~~ [~~this~~](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07G4LP2SB/?coliid=I1AXKS77THPMF1&colid=29JHQJA8RTN8U&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) ~~tape for a specific, private purpose and can't go outside comfortably without it. Lacking the tape I have to endure severe pain for hours which often results in injury. (Upside of injury, scabs! Downside, pain, limited movement, ongoing skin damage.)~~\*

\*The above has been sent by the incredible u/ichliebespink \- thank you post incoming as soon as the tape does. It'll be my best friend and a huge relief for so many days.

I did say and/or, but you can't delete posts so I'll leave the second item in just in case there are other kind strangers out there who see the title, wonder what the sleep aid is and wonder why it's not in the post.

The other thing I need is [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07G5MRSC3/?coliid=I2XQGDLONTE8GH&colid=29JHQJA8RTN8U&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it). It used to just be a want for when the one we have broke. Well, it broke. The guy who came to fix the shower yesterday accidentally whacked it with his toolbox and SMASH. But today it was added to the [emergency list](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2N9LWEZQ895XH?ref_=wl_share) because sleep is not properly attainable without it. There are nightmares, there's restlessness, but the calming nature of one of these splattered across the ceiling and walls gets rid of all that. I'm not fully sure why it works, but it does.

I'm not asking for both. Both would be excellent, but just one is great. They're of equal importance.

Here's the emergency list link again: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2N9LWEZQ895XH?ref\_=wl\_share](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2N9LWEZQ895XH?ref_=wl_share)

I really admire what you all do here. I look forward to attempting to contribute in a few months\* when my site is ready and my services (which I'll be offering free) are browse-able.

\*Months may turn to weeks instead. I have a few things I could showcase and offer a freebie of in the coming weeks as soon as I get the ones for myself done."
,[Request] I need a new battery for my cellphone to help me find a job.,"Ok, here is my situation.  In early December I was released from a job.

Thank you so much.

It is a follow-up from [this earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/e8c0gi/request_i_could_really_use_period_panties_but_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)"
,[REQUEST] An SSD for my dying laptop!,"Hello everyone at r/RandomKindness!

I am doing my bachelor's in Computer Science and have been absolutely loving the subject for about 2 years now. I especially love participating in security events like CTFs, which are events where you try and hack your way through the given challenges. It makes me feel cool too as an added bonus.

I also love programming and working in visual effects software like After Effects and Photoshop. 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY I NEED THIS: 

My laptop of 4 years has been able to keep up quite well with my workflow so far. 

However, recently,  it has started to become unbearably slow and would cause a lot of programs, which previously worked perfectly, to crash for no good reason. 

Upon diagnosis, it was obvious that my hard drive was the one struggling.

I run both Linux and Windows since I need to use a Linux environment for participating in hacking events like CTFs and whatnot. So, I was able to alleviate the problem a little bit by using a lightweight Linux distro that the good friends over at r/FindMeADistro helped me pick. 

&#x200B;

This helped me alleviate the issues. But it is clear that I can't rely on Linux since I do a lot of graphic design and editing work on Windows.   


So, I still need to meander through the crashes and freezes if I am to get any work done. Upon looking into upgrading options, it seems like upgrading to an SSD seems to be the way to go.

&#x200B;

An SSD would allow me to be able to boot into any OS I want very fast, while also improving the responsiveness of my system by a significant margin. Also, I would also be able to use my hard drive as a secondary drive for applications that don't require top speed.

&#x200B;

As an added bonus, no more unsaved projects freezing on me at 2 am that I can only do nothing about. That's a huge relief for me.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY I CAN'T AFFORD THIS

Something like this is not an easy expense for my family, since we are going through a financial struggle right now and this isn't something I want to stress my parents out with.

&#x200B;

SSDs used to be insanely expensive, but they have come down in price by a lot recently, and are worth the expense now, as is the case with many technologies. 

&#x200B;

I have talked to them about it and they do understand that I need it, but at the same time, they talked me through their financial situation and showed me why they can't afford this right now. 

&#x200B;

So, that's the reason why I don't want to talk about this with them further. Since this is one of those purchases that aren't essential to everyone's life in the family.

That being said, it would make my life a LOT easier, since I don't have to keep pulling up task manager every 15 minutes to end the application that decided it's had enough.  


\---------------------------------------------

It would be AMAZING if someone would purchase this for me. 

It would allow me to focus on learning rather than hoping my applications work properly and don't crash. There's also the added bonus of improving the speed of my laptop. 

I found one on amazon that costs 50 bucks on amazon and I think it's a good balance between price and speed for an SSD. 

[Here's the SSD I think would be a good fit.](https://www.amazon.in/hz/wishlist/ls/2SOK0Z2GTQ48S?ref_=wl_share)

I appreciate you guys reading through this post, I really do.

,[Offer] Need a Keto Buddy or help getting started?,"I’ve been on keto for 3 years. The first 9 months I lost 85 lbs. After that I continued due to maintenance, health benefits, and just loving the way I feel. Also, hating the way I feel when I eat off plan.

I know it’s hard getting started. There’s always questions of what to eat, when to eat, what to do when the scale stops moving. Plus, sometimes we all need a cheerleader in our corner. 

So, I’m offering to share what I know with someone getting started, or just talk you out of binge eating carbs, when you’ve had one of those days. I can share my weekly menus and recipes, if wanted / needed. 

I’m only picking two people because I already have a few other people I’m helping. 

My stipulation is this: Be serious. Don’t ask me for help if you don’t really want to go all in. It actually takes 3 - 7 days to achieve ketosis, eating right, and only takes one bowl of oatmeal to have to start over. Keto is all in or all out. You can’t carb binge on the weekends and expect to lose weight.

You should also know that I’m very straightforward. I tell it like it is and not necessarily what you want to hear. I’m also very happily married and will not put up with unsolicited photos or crude comments. I also work full time and while I can usually answer you pretty quickly, I can’t promise it will always be immediately.

Good with all that? Tell me why you want to be my buddy. 

Just to make this very clear though: **I am NOT a nutritionist, dietician, doctor, or health professional of any kind. I cannot and will not advise on health issues.


EDIT: I don’t know how to mark this fulfilled. I’m taking on more than 2 or 3, but that’s okay as long as everyone has a little patience with me!"

,[REQUEST] Some smart-ish shoes I can wear for work.," 

Hello, new here feel a bit cheeky requesting something here but you know, desperate times and all that... Story is basically I work in an office and my only smart boots I wear for work have been completely destroyed by overwearing, the sole has really bad holes in and they don't look even remotely acceptable now. So came in today in my plain black trainers hoping nobody would notice. Immediately got taken to the side and informed I wasn't wearing appropriate footwear. I said I understand and will sort it. But Christmas has really screwed me over money wise, between all the usual festive stuff moving flat and changing jobs all around a similar time has left me struggling more than ever this January so here I am.  
Thanks for reading, happy new year!

,[Offer] I’d like to offer a free Audible audiobook [WWW],"I fell back in love with reading last year and want to encourage others where I can with it, especially if you have a resolution for reading! I learned today about Audibles “send a book” feature where people can open one audio book for free, whether a member or not.

So you can pick anything out of my library, and I should be able to message you the link to claim it. My current library is a mix of fiction, self help, science, and memoirs. 

Salt, fat, acid, heat - Samin Nosrat

Present over perfect - shauna Niquist 

Fail until you don’t - Bobby bones

City of girls - Elizabeth Gilbert 
 
Where the crawdads sing - Delia Owens 

Girl, wash your face - Rachel Hollis 

Educated- Tara westover

Blue mind - Wallace j. Nichols 

Hillbilly elegy - JD Vance 

Before we were yours - Lisa wingate

Eleanor Oliphant is completely fine - Gail honey man

Free Cyntoia  - Cyntoia Brown-Long

**The sun does shine - Anthony Ray Hinton

So should work as long as you haven’t received one before. :) 

Also, if you’ve already claimed one, I use the Libby app to borrow library audiobooks and there are some classic novels as well on Spotify. Happy reading!

EDIT: I looked it up and I can send each individual book up to ten times, so even if you’ve seen a book taken, it can be sent again (and again and again.)

**EDIT EDIT: I am adding “the sun does shine” by Anthony Ray Hinton because it was my top favorite book I’ve read in the past 5 years or so. It’s the true story of a man wrongfully convicted and put on death row for 30 years. Highly, highly recommend. It has themes of race, education, and forgiveness. So, so good. Would love to share."

,[Request] Any used telescope eyepieces [Australia],"Hi Reddit,

I really wanted to start a new hobby and from a long time was thinking to get a telescope. As in 2019, I worked hard on my health to recover from stress fracture injury that was tough because I have osteopenia. I wanted to reward myself. This new year I got myself a used telescope in $100. It came with 4mm eyepiece only. I checked all eyepieces and kits are really expensive and at the moment I can't spend anymore on this. It will be a great help if anyone can help me out with their used eyepieces. I can't start anything without a 20mm(dia 1.25"") or more.

The holidays were good to my furbabies. Too good. We have received more treats and chews then we can comfortably store in our tiny kitchen and are looking to share the love. I can do one box, or maybe 2 small, to include random dog consumables, such as Smartbones, rawhide, some wet food cans and random dry treats/jerky. Most treats are for larger/ medium dogs; mine are a Husky and a Shepard so may not be appropriate for smaller or toy breeds. Do you know a deserving canine? Was your dogs stoocking light this year? Let me know, so we can fix that!

Edit: Wow, thanks for all the great responses! I'm leaving this up until tomorrow when several random winners will be chosen. 

Edit 2: We are enjoying this so much we are going out and making up a few more holiday dog boxes. Never fear if you are not chosen this time...look for more RandomActsOfDog from us in the near future. Happy holidays woofs of reddit, from Arkansas and Freyja ❤"

,[Offer] USA Hand Knit Hat to a Random Winner (US Only),"During the 2018 Olympics I knitted a bunch of these hats similar to the USA Olympic athletes hats.  It was a super fun knit and I got a little carried away making quite a few.  Well, two years later, one of the USA hats sat unfinished because I ran out of navy blue yarn.  Of course after I finished it, there was enough for another hat.  So, what's another hat?  Well, this last one has no home.  Any of my friends who would love one has one.  I am picky about who gets knitted items from me so I am thinking a kind person here will appreciate it.   I will leave this offer up for a day and will choose a winner tomorrow evening (approx 9pm CST) using a random number generator.   Comment with your interest to be included in the drawing.

,"[REQUEST] Requesting short, quick, audio recordings in any and all foreign languages as a gift for my ""linguaphile"" and culture-loving mother!","Hi all,

My mother is a massive lover of languages and of different cultures. She speaks 3 languages fluently and dabbles in many, many others. She has worked as an interpreter and translator for over 10 years now. Also, we are Latin American, and as such we have the tradition of giving gifts on January 6th (we're not really religious, but that's the day that the three wise men supposedly gave Jesus Christ gifts).

This year, I'd like to gift my mother as many recordings possible in all manner of foreign languages, dialects, and accents. Please help me out with this endeavor! I am asking for a quick audio recording of a spoken message in a language that isn't English (it can be done most easily on [Vocaroo](https://vocaroo.com/)), and the written translation into English of what it is you said. Please also include in English writing the name of the language and/or dialect you are speaking, and if you're comfortable, identify the regional accent you speak in. I'll probably turn it into a video, with the recordings as the audio and the text as the visuals.

Here is what I am asking for in the audio message:

* Please greet my mother by name (Her name is Cristina)
* Please introduce yourself (all I'm asking for is a first name, and it doesn't have to be your real name, just something that we can identify you by and refer to you as), and *if you want*, say something about yourself (what you do for work, or what your interests are, or anything you want)
* Please share at least one interesting or cool cultural or linguistic fact, or read a passage from a book or poem in your chosen language, or sing her something in your chosen language even! Anything like that.
* Anything else you would like to say to her!

Please feel free to keep your audio message as short or as long as you like, as long as it fulfills the above requests (10 or 20 seconds is just as fine as a minute or more!). Of course, just keep in mind that whatever you say, I also need the English translation please. Also, my Mom speaks Spanish and Italian fluently (as well as English), but recordings in these languages are welcome as well! Please, the more the merrier.

Here are a few things about her that may help you craft your message:

* My Mom also is fascinated by architecture
* She also loves psychology and has a Master's degree in it
* She is a lover of all kinds of music
* My mother loves to travel (although she's had very few opportunities to in the last 20 years) and learn about different places around the world
* Mom has a great sense of humor and loves all kinds of jokes
* She loves all kinds of cuisines from all around the world
* She loves literature from all around the world

If possible, please private message me your Vocaroo links and English translations and such. Repeat languages/dialects from different people are welcome, as are repeat contributions in different languages from the same contributor, as long as each contribution shares a new interesting fact or reads a different passage or poem, or whatever it may be. Please introduce yourself and greet my mother in each one as well. Thank you to all!

Thank you very, very much! Also, if anyone has any suggestions as to what other subreddits I could post this to, please tell me, I'd appreciate it. Thank you!

,"[REQUEST] 48"" x 24"" wood tabletop","My current situation requires me to move into an 8'x8' room. After placing a bed, dresser, and side table I don't have room for a desk. I've been allowed to put braces into the walls of my closet that could support a board for a makeshift desk.

The actual dimensions of the closet walls are 47.5"" wide and 23.25"" deep (on one side, so I only need to cut out a small notch to fix the depth), but I have access to a hand saw so a 48"" x 24"" wood top could be made to fit. I know that cutting it would ruin the cut edges, but they'll be up against a wall anyways. 

I was considering particle board since that's the cheapest option, but it would be nice to have finished wood so it's easier to write and use a mouse on. 

I am in Seattle. I understand that wood is pretty heavy and expensive to ship, so I should be able to borrow a car and come pick up a board if anyone has one available in this area. I will be out of town until Jan 3, so hopefully we can get the timing to match up if anyone has something available.

,[Request] Help my father find the soldiers he fought with...,"Hello Reddit,

My father is a United States Marine Vietnam War Vet. For several years he's spent a lot of his time trying to find the men he served with. He's been to countless reunions and had no luck finding anyone. I'm hoping someone if anyone out their can help me try and figure this stuff out for him.

My father was apart of the Marine Bravo Company 1st Battalion 1st Division (Not sure if that's 100% accurate, but that's what he says when I ask.) My father doesn't talk about the war much and when I ask him if he's had any luck finding his friends he tells me no and lately he's been just saying he's going to give up.

I don't know how all this works, but even my father being able to visit the graves of these men would do so much for him. We managed to locate one man of his group when we took a vacation and made a stop in Mississippi; this is the one and only time I've ever seen my father shed a tear when we stood at the grave of a man he said saved his life in the war.

I'll gladly provide more details in private for anyone who might know how to help.

Thanks for your time!  


Edit: Hey everyone! I've got to say I didn't expect this to be so heavily up-voted and responded to. I'm doing a lot of the stuff recommended and just waiting on responses back. I've also managed to get with my father and get a little more info. I'm keeping most of it private from this and comments for obvious reasons lol. I have responded to most who have PM'd me with details to see where it can get us on this.

I'm so glad so many people are trying to help; my father is also equally excited and I will do my best to post updates to this post -- but I don't imagine they'll come overnight."

,[OFFER] I will help you learn/teach you some basic Excel,"So inspired by the current post on LPT:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ed86bq/lpt\_learn\_excel\_its\_one\_of\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ed86bq/lpt_learn_excel_its_one_of_the_most/)

&#x200B;

I use Excel on a daily basis, and while I'm by no means a master I can teach you some basic formula, what a VLOOKUP is, what the hell a pivot table is, and the basic idea behind recording a macro. If you work in any sort of office environment some basic excel knowledge can be useful to impress your peers.

&#x200B;

Little unsure about exactly HOW I am going to do this, but if anyone is interested we'll try and work something out :) If the post does get any sort of traction (because I honestly have no idea if anyone cares) then I might have to limit it to a few people at a time.

&#x200B;

Quick Edit: You do not need to own excel for this as I will probably use google sheets."
,[Request] Voice recording of a short phrase,"So my therapist once made a joke about how I need a button, like a Staples ""Easy"" button, that says ""Can we reframe that?"" to remind me to reframe my cognitive distortions. I thought the concept was amusing enough to actually make a reality, so I got one of those little buttons that you can record phrases in, but I underestimated how much I would dislike hearing myself in a recording. Would anybody be willing to record themselves saying ""Can we reframe that?"" for my little cognitive distortion button?

Thank you in advance!"
,[REQUEST] Amazon Pantry or a supermarket online shop [UK],"EDIT: I did have mods add a flair but I’ve had a couple of very kind messages still so just to let everyone know I have managed to get some food for now, so no thanks thread but thank you to everyone who has offered help!!

Hello kind redditors!

This is my first time posting on this sub or asking for help at all on the internet, but I’m in a bit of a pickle.

My partner left his job a couple months ago for a new job, but the new employer screwed him over, leaving him jobless. He has now got a new job but he won’t get his first pay until mid way through January.

As a result I’ve had to use the entirety of my pay this month, plus the whole of what little we had saved for our wedding, just to pay the bills. I can’t afford to do that and pay for food shopping at the same time.

My dad is coming to visit next weekend (28/12) and he said he will take us food shopping, but that still leaves us with empty cupboards for a week.

If anyone would be kind enough to send us an amazon pantry delivery or an online supermarket delivery to tide us through the next week, we would both be so, so grateful.

Thank you!"

,[OFFER] Canada/USA Only:) Surprise Holiday Gifts!," Hello and happy holidays! I have never participated in this sub before (though I love mail and giving gifts) so I apologize for any errors in this post.

I have recently acquired a gift card to a local mall, and since I already have some shipping boxes, I figured I'd buy some small things to fill them up and send them to someone who needs help with last minute holiday gifting. I will be sending two boxes:

**Box 1: To be sent to a Redditor who is in school** (ex. college) and may be struggling, need some holiday cheer, or is otherwise not expecting to receive many gifts. Please include your age in your comment.

**Box 2: To be sent to a Redditor who has immediate family** and needs help to be able to provide gifts for their family members. Please include the gender and age of each person you would like gifts for in your comment.

**General Rules**

1. Account must be at least 6 months old
2. Indicate in your comment whether you are looking to receive box 1 or box 2
3. Please do not PM me, I will PM the users I have selected to receive a box

Because of the materials I have available to make this offer happen, I will be purchasing the gifts from retail stores and bundling them into shipping boxes myself, and am therefore unable to purchase the gifts from Amazon wishlists.

,[Offer] Will do some (potentially good?) Photoshops,"Hey everyone!

Hello! I've had a pretty rough time recently, and giving always makes me feel good.

I don't have much to offer at the moment, but I consider myself a bit of a sticker collector and have accumulated quite a few different kinds of stickers (from cat stickers to Rick and Morty to space themed ones). I'd love to send someone a few stickers to brighten their day.

Please let me know a bit about yourself/why you need your day brightened and I'll go through my collection and send you a few stickers that I think you'll like!

,[Offer] Handwritten “snail mail” letters!,"I’ve been thinking about a couple things I used to get a lot of joy out of as a kid. I used to play snail mail chess with my papa when I was younger, he lived in Canada and we had moved to Ireland. I had a couple of pen pals, and coming up to Christmas I remember the magic of Santa. I really could hear the hooves on the roof top. I do calligraphy and have been missing the days where I did a lot of writing by hand, so here’s a few suggestions for what I can do: 

1. If your kid has sent a Santa letter, send me some details to put in a reply and I will write them a personalized letter from Santa and post it to them. 

2. If you are lonely or would like a pen pal, send me a message with something you’d like me to talk about, or something going on in your life and I will reply by letter. You don’t have to respond but if you do I’ll read it and write back!! 

3. You want to play snail mail chess? I can probably only do one person with this but I will if anyone wants! 

4. None of the above but you want a letter? Just ask (: 

- depending how many people are interested it may take time to get to you. I will prioritize Santa letters to get them to you before Christmas. 

I don’t know if this is something anyone would be interested in but I just thought it was a nice idea because I miss getting and writing letters!"

,[Offer] I'll send you jokes to your DM to help get you through the holidays. [Anywhere],"[offer] I'll send you jokes If it'll help you smile during the holidays.

As someone who has lost several people close to me around the holiday season.... I'm keenly aware of the fact that not everyone is full of Christmas cheer.

To be honest I live a very busy life and I'm not sure if I could get out and send people cards via snail mail. 

Foundational to who I am, I believe we all have the ability within ourselves to choose to laugh or cry. More often than not I choose to laugh.

My proposition is simple:
If you dm me and tell me the style of humor you prefer... Dad jokes, lame jokes, nerdy jokes, off color jokes,....
Then I will send you back no questions asked a joke. 

You can message me as many times as you need, I may not respond immediately but I will send you one. 

If jokes aren't your thing, I'm down for whatever.... I'm just trying to keep it in my skill set... But hell I'll send you pictures of cute animals if it'll make you feel better.

*Edit feel free to PM me, or request in the thread and I'll get back to you. PM's work best because I work 50 plus hours a week and I probably shouldn't spend all day on Reddit lol.

*Edit two: I got a lot more responses than I thought I would. If you did not receive your joke, or if you'd like another joke please message me directly."

I decided to knit and give away a scarf. It's a red basketweave scarf measuring 5 inches across and 6 feet long. Yes, 6 feet long! I like to make scarves that can be wrapped multiple times and worn in multiple ways.

He was really into the seminar presentation topic I did earlier in the term, so I thought I would expand it to ""Short fiction as information technology in anthropometric narratives"" (Yeah, I dont know either) I have been so burnt out the past few days that I feel aimless and rambley and my arguments aren't supported well nor do they make good logic.

The Christmas card can be as vague or as personal as you would like. I could do as little as just writing in your favorite color. Or I could make a handwritten encouragement about concerns or goals you have around this time. Even advice! Or I could just share silly things like a friend might do.


If you accept this offer, please inform me if you would prefer print or cursive handwriting. I normally write in cursive.


**UPDATE:** I'm marking this offer as closed, to insure that I don't have too many cards to complete them all. I'll write cards for everyone that's commented or messaged so far. I can't guarantee that they will all arrive by Christmas, but I wish!!

I (F19) live with my fiancé (M27) and we're just starting out. We don't have any friends and we're not on the best of terms with our families, so we're not going to get any cards this year, and that makes me really unhappy. Can anyone add me to their list for this year?"
,[REQUEST] Help searching a replacement for precious broken possession,"I am NOT asking for a purchase. I only want help finding where I can buy the object I'm looking for.


Someone very close to me discovered that one of their favorite possessions is now broken. I can describe the item, and also have pictures of what's left for whoever is interested.


It was a glass night light in the shape of a candle holder cup, with an open top like a candle holder also. It had a short string of lights inside the glass to make it glow. It was frosted glass and had a small painting stamped on it. The picture was of wintery animals in a sleigh together. Again, I can send pictures to help. I have every piece of the glass painting and can show what the picture is.

I've tried searching for the item online, but sponsored products come up instead of anything related.

If anyone has time, I would love to have help searching online. Maybe one of you knows better ways or better places to search. It would mean the world to this person if I could replace their broken light. Though it's not expensive, large, or complex, it was very precious to them.

**UPDATE:**

I created an imgur album with the pictures I have.

Boudica, my mom says she would highly recommend those socks for you as well. They're very soft, warm, and cute. Shes been wearing them those whole time i think.

Rose, she thinks the blanket cost way more than it did because apparently the fabric quality is nicer than the cheap ones she had many years ago. So she's also really happy with it and recommends it as well :) She says its helping her shoulder/neck pains already and she only got it yesterday.

,[REQUEST] Scar removal cream for self harm scars,"I was suggested this sub after asking for recommendations for scar removal cream. I'm new here so sorry if format is wrong or anything.

I have dozens of self harm scars on both of my thighs. Every summer I try really hard to keep them hidden but I'm so tired of the anxiety of people seeing them. I know I should probably just be open about them but my family doesn't know about my past with self harm and for several years my biggest fear has been someone asking me what the scars are on my legs. I'm really tired of wearing pants in the summer or wearing shorts and always having to cover my thighs. I'm a college student and in a position where I can't have a job right now so the cost of this scar removal cream I was recommended is quite a bit for me. From what I understand, these creams take a long time to work so I should probably start using it soon as to have my scars reduced or gone by summer.

In an offer post by a kind Redditor who continues to give every year (we’re not sure if this may be from him!), I mentioned selling my home earlier this year to avoid foreclosure. There was a cat who came by for almost or over a year, but we couldn’t afford to take him in. We fed him what we could. It wasn’t much, but it was all we could do. 


So when we sold our home, we finally took him in. We couldn’t leave him to fend for himself in the freezing winter cold or summer heat anymore. He would at least have a warm and safe place to sleep, even if we have to ration out the food, and mostly buy what’s on clearance.


A few months later, there was a ball shaped growth near his hind leg, and we found out it was a tumor. We were so heartbroken to think that we took him in too late, that he finally found a home, only to not have much longer to live.


We decided to go ahead with surgery for him. The tumor is out now and he is recovering. Here he is with his cone of shame! He doesn’t have to wear it anymore though, because we sewed up a cloth to put there instead so he wouldn’t lick or scratch while the site heals. 
We’re hoping we’ll be through this time together. 

Here’s our other cat who we took in many years ago. He would wait in the rain for my son to come home from school. Despite his baby face, he’s a very old man lol.

Life has been tough, but we will get through it. Thank you so much for your kindness. It truely means so much to us!"
,[OFFER] Womens size small coats. Philadelphia. Must be able to pick up. More info below.,"I just cleaned out my coat closet. I have a few nice coats that are a woman's small. 1 wool peacoat from old navy, 1 jean jacket from forever 21, 1 medium weight rain jacket from Hollister. All are in like new condition. The wool coat still has tags. If anyone needs them, please comment below. Thanks!!"
,[OFFER] Editing and/or Feedback on Papers,"I wanted to offer *something* to this sub, so, inspired by u/__TheBoulder__ , I thought I'd offer up my services.

Just to give you an idea of my background, I have a decent amount of experience writing and editing undergraduate- and graduate-level papers. I worked as a writing tutor as an undergraduate, and I have advanced degrees in a couple writing-intensive social sciences, where I also taught classes in which I required multiple papers (yes, I'm *that* evil).

So what do I need from you? Well, obviously, first a comment that you're interested. Then we can discuss getting the following to me if it sounds like I can help you:

1. Your paper. It needs to be more or less complete, but it can be as good or as awful as it needs to be. No judgements here. I've seen it all.

2. The assignment or directions for the paper. Including anything like formatting, citation style, due date, and grading rubric if you have those available.

3. What *you* would like help with. Some people have trouble organizing their papers. Some papers lack transparency or readability. Do you need help with grammatical choices, word count, formatting, removing the occasional swear word...?

Do you not know what you need? I'm happy to help you figure out what needs work, and where to concentrate your efforts, but I won't be able to do the work for you, so you'll need to leave some time to edit after I get it back to you. I may have suggestions for wording and structure, of course, but this needs to be *your* work, so the choices you make still need to reflect your voice. It's possible that I can help with things like research, methods, or analysis, but I'll be doing editing as the priority.

Oh, and it doesn't need to be a social science or humanities paper, but those are where I spent most of my time, so I'm most comfortable in those general areas. I don't remember having any papers for biology, chemistry, etc. anyway; but hey, you never know.

I obviously can't guarantee the grade you want, but I'm willing to spend some time with you to try to improve your paper. Since each paper would take some time to reply to, depending on what you need, I'm going to limit myself to five people for now, but I'll try to help more if I'm able. It probably needs to be limited to 20 pages or so double-spaced (please no size 8 fonts 😁). 

I can work with pretty much any level and content, including some graduate stuff if it's not too far afield. If you aren't in school and you have some other project you're working on that you want another pair of eyes on, I'm willing to give it a shot! Even things like a personal essay/application, your CV, or a letter you want to send your landlord for being a complete piece of garbage. I can at least give you suggestions...

One of the most important things is turnaround time. If you're in school, you're probably knee deep in finals. I will do my absolute *best* to get you feedback within 24 hours, and no more than 48 hours. I have more free time on weekdays to do this, so I'll start tomorrow if anyone has anything, but I may not be able to get to anything again until Monday. Let me know if it's urgent though, because I really want to help."
,[Request] Spouse had to go back to their country a week after we got married. Just someone to talk to who’s trans friendly.,"I’m just looking for some support. I’m just so lonely from having to say goodbye to my partner literally a week after getting married. 

They are from the UK and I don’t know when they’ll be back. Visas are super expensive. Leaving them at the airport has made me really sad and I don’t have any friends. 

It’s been so hard that I didn’t eat for 4 days and I cry whenever I’m alone. The people who have messaged me stop after about 2 replies and it’s very discouraging."

,[THANKS] Best package ever!,"Thank you so  much, /u/Principessa3

You really made my day when I came home to a package. My dog, Lars, was so excited when I opened the box and OBVIOUSLY had to sniff out the dirt to make sure it was up to his standards. On a more serious note... I really have trouble committing to buying myself little, unnecessary things like dirt for my plants.. what you did was more than just give my new plants some fresh soil. You made my (very stressful) day so much brighter. You made me smile & remember to not sweat stuff I cannot change. You gave me a reason to sit down with my pup this weekend and repot my plants, which is quiet time I truly cherish. You truly took a burden off me, because I knew I had to buy it, but just couldn't budget it out given the other Christmas gifts I had to purchase for family and friends. Something so small made a huge impact on my day and I cannot thank you enough.

&#x200B;

Stay wonderful. Stay bright. Happy Holidays, everyone...and especially /u/Principessa3. <3"
,[Request] an electric blanket and/or slippers for my mom,"Hello everyone. To put my request simply: my mom is disabled, the cold weather causes her a lot of pain, and its gotten pretty bad lately. I dont want to make you read a whole bunch, so im cool with answering questions if you have them. But yeah, im basically asking for help with this because i dont have the means to help her myself right now and i hate seing her so upset as she was the other day.  Im hoping to get her an electric blanket, and some slippers, i think that would help her a lot. Or even one or the other because anything is better than what she has right now, which is nothing for cold weather at all...

(Disabilities include arthritis, fibromyalgia, diabetes, & another thing i dont remember the name of. So; bone, muscle, and joint pain, and nerve damage is what she talks about having.)

 In February I had a stroke and required brain surgery. Myself, my husband and our two children ended up moving in with my husbands parents so he could take care of me after surgery. I’m finally in a place where I can confidently take care of myself and my children while my husband starts his new job and we are finally moving to our own place again! We are honestly just needing those basic things that you don’t really think about but add up when starting over. Since my surgery I’m also weirdly sensitive to allergens so my doc thought it might help to get a air purifier, that’s why that is on my wishlist specifically. Well Happy Holidays to all 💜 
Quick edit; 
we will be moving into our new place January 16th, which is also my birthday! Yay! I was told the moving day might be helpful"

,[Request] Winter is coming - electric socks for bf’s icicles/feet,"I wanted to request some heated socks for my partner. We are both students and haven’t really been able to have the heating on yet (our apartment doesn’t have gas so it’s electric only and through a prepayment system which means the rates are high). It’s been pretty cold the last couple of weeks, we make do by layering up and getting under a blanket, but my bf’s feet are constantly freezing (they’re like little blocks of ice when I touch him, I don’t know how he survives!) and we don’t have carpets in our apartment so even with socks/slippers the floor is always cold unless we heat the room. One of my friends got an electric parka thing and suggested some heated socks, which would be absolutely perfect for my partner, as they’ll hopefully thaw his feet out even when our apartment is cold.

,[Request] Special Ed class equipment,"My son is in a moderate and mild special needs class (ADHD, high functioning ASD, physical disabilities). His elementary school receives low funding because it has very few low income families, which is mostly fine because families earn comfortably and buy basic supplies and fundraise easily. However, in our class that means parents pitch in for regular supplies and things like sensory stuff on top of extra medical expenses. Many of us are single income households because of needing to take care of these kids. 

A few parents and I have pitched in for most of the kinesthetic seating. However, I think we are maxed out, other parents have not responded at all and things have just halted. I have even returned a few impulse  purchases in the last couple of months to save up. We are already half way into the school year, and as the room parent I feel somewhat responsible to wrap this up soon so I thought I'd ask you kind people for help.

This is the little one who we took in after selling our home. He had been coming to our home for close to a year, but we couldn't afford to take him in but fed him what we could. So after selling our home, we couldn't leave him there to fend for himself and finally took him in. A few months later, we found out he had a tumor. It was a removed a few weeks ago. He's now in recovery and hopefully, we can move pass our hardships together!

You'll see he's wearing a cloth near his hindlegs. That's where the tumor was! Sewed up a cloth to cover where his stitches are so he won't lick or scratch there!

Here is our old man who was also a stray. He's been with us through, hopefully, our toughest time of selling our home to avoid foreclosure. The little man loves toys and treats!

The old man eventually got tired and went to take a nap in the box everything came in! lol"

I have posted here once before and had a lot of fun putting people's trees together and helping them get in touch with their routes.

I randomly selected BnJova and AmberCrafty as the winners- wish I could’ve done more but perhaps another time when my pockets are deeper. Thanks again y’all"
,[THANKS] u/dz314159,Thank you so much u/dz314159 for the lucky iron fish! I'm so excited :) ❤️
,[REQUEST] A lucky iron fish because I'm very anemic,"I've been anemic for a couple years now and have to get my blood drawn every six months usually. I'm almost always below what my doctor prefers her patients to be at, but not quite low enough to warrant iron transfusions. My health suffers because of this, I'm constantly weak, tired and anxious, and just recently I've been experiencing restless leg syndrome which is awful. I have a fear of swallowing pills, and I already take a few a day which stresses me out and I sometimes just forgo my iron supplement, which I know I shouldn't. So my iron supplementation is quite sporadic. Having a lucky iron fish in my life would be an immense help and take so much stress off my shoulders, as silly as that probably sounds.

Here is my Amazon wishlist for the lucky iron fish

I would love to connect with someone and offer them guidance/assistance if they have a running related goal- whether it be someone who has never run and is starting a couch to 5k or someone tackling their first longer distance race. 

This would include an excel calendar doc of daily running workouts based on our conversations and  your personal goals, and access to me via discord or email for questions/concerns/check ins etc. 

I’ve coached various people through their first half marathon, full marathon, and 5ks. I myself am an ultra runner who just completed her first 100 miler in August, so I have a little bit of experience!

Disclaimer: I’m not an ‘official’ running coach with certa, and my advice/guidance is all from personal experience of getting myself from a 5k to 100 miler in 4 years. I cannot give you nutritional advice or gym/lifting workouts as I don’t feel comfortable with that based on my knowledge."

I was thinking of 50 CAD gift cards (I don’t really mind which supermarket as long as I can buy the card online) for 2 people in Canada.

I'm drowning in bills -- rent, car payment, phone, etc. I take care of my mother who is disabled, and I have three rescue animals. I was hit by a taxi in July (you just can't make this stuff up!) and I'm hoping to get something even meager from the settlement, but it's looking like it may take a few more months. 

I haven't been buying food for myself so I can take care of my family and my pets. It would be such a huge help to have the essentials to get through until January. I give my dogs rice and vegtables to make the dry food last longer.

,[OFFER] Christmas PC Building/Upgrading Guidance,"Hey there r/RandomKindness Community,

&#x200B;

I did this exact thing about 8 months ago and I had the chance to help many people out on their PC Build/Upgrade/Fix problems, and since christmas is just around the corner I thought i'll renew my offer.

&#x200B;

I am a passionate Gamer and Techie, an active member of various Tech/Gaming related subreddits and forums, ex-employee of a PC-Repair Shop and a PC consultant for the elderly in honorary service.

&#x200B;

If you are (like many these days) playing with the thought of upgrading your old or buying a new PC System, this is the offer for you. Speak to me about your plans in general or ask me specific questions, don't shy away to ask ""stupid questions"" because there are no stupid questions. There has been a great number of new hardware items released into the market lately (because Christmas) and it can be very confusing to assess them into the big picture.

&#x200B;

I can communicate in english or german on various platforms, preferably Discord or Steam since the Reddit Chat is a pain in the ass.

Sincerly

,[Request] An interview with an American born 1950 or before for school.,"While I will be asking questions and writing notes, this is not a formal interview. The questions are more to guide a conversation, if that makes sense. My paper is about an American born person and how major political, economic, and historical events impacted their life. I am to tie these historical events to the changes in your life and the world around you. While this may include your family somewhat, you would be the main subject and focus. Basically, I ask you to tell your story and how these events impacted your daily life whether it be directly or indirectly. Obviously you are free to not answer any question you feel uncomfortable with, however, these are not personal hard-hitting questions. Below are a list of questions I have come up with so far. These were written before I had any particular subject in mind, but they will get the story-telling led to the right direction.


* What year were you born?

* What city were you born in?

* How many siblings do you have?

* What did your parents do for a living?

* What economic class would you identify with during your childhood?

* Did your economic class change during your childhood? Adulthood?

* What was your first job?

* Did you attend high school?

* Did you attend college?

* Did you serve in the military? Did your parents?

* Did you experience an increase in standard of living?

* What technology increased that standard of living?

* Did you experience any of these events or issues? Directly or indirectly. If no, did your parents?

 * The Great Depression

 * World War II

 * The economic boom post WWII

 * The fear of communism

 * The Cold War

 * The Korean War

 * The Vietnam War

 * Racism

 * Segregation / Jim Crow

 * The Civil Rights Movement

 * Sexism / Gender norms

 * Women’s change of roles

 * Women’s Rights Movement

 * Religious discrimination

 * Discrimination of immigrants

 * Did you marry?

 * Did you have children? If so, how many?

Edit: I have found someone to help me. Thank you all for the offers!"

,[Offer] Chromebooks,"Hey guys! 

I’m a 5th grade teacher. I purchased a few chromebooks a couple of years ago for my classroom, but only ended up using them for 1 year. My school received a 1:1 technology grant, so each student now has their own Chromebook, which means mine are now just collecting dust. They have been reset, come with a charging cord, and are in perfect working condition. 

I am not allowed to give them to my students, because it is a conflict of interest. So, I would like to give them away to people who genuinely need them. They can be for an adult or a kid. I have 4 of them. I will be giving two away now, and two more next week. I am going to have to keep shipping to the US or Canada.

Rules: 
1. I don’t want to hear sob stories. I work with some of the most underprivileged students, and believe me when I say that teachers shoulder their students problems and carry them with them. Which is why I want to keep this post more fun and lighthearted. I would like to know a little bit about who you’re requesting for and what it would be used for. 

2. Don’t PM me. I will report you. If I choose you, I will message you. 

3. I will be having the mods help me vet the requests. I will have them lock it on Sunday, and will then pick and message the winners. 

4. Bonus points if you tell me something nice that happened to you this week!"

PS: I am from europe, I do not know if the code also works for [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) or something. If it does not I am very sorry. The back says [Amazon.de](https://Amazon.de) and associates though, so it *should* work.

So I’ve been doing this for a few years now and I’ve usually stuck with friends’ kids but I thought I’d see if anyone would want a letter to their little ones. I can do a general “You’re on the good list...”  stuff or if they want to write a letter “to Santa”, it would be a response letter.

I want to help out someone who may be struggling. Be it food, diapers, hygiene products, infant toys/books/etc, pet products, etc. If I can make purchases for two different small requests, I'm happy to do so. Amazon is preferred. USA.

Edit. There are Amazon lockers, I think, pretty fairly scattered. Happy to send things to them."
,[Request] Basic art supplies,"I feel kind of pathetic posting here but I thought it wouldn’t hurt. I am an American student studying in the UK and have been trying to get a part time job for months. Nowhere is responding to me and I think it’s because I’m american. Hiring a foreign worker is a bit more trouble than hiring a native one so companies probably don’t want to go through the hassle. 

On top of that, I am so occupied by uni that my mental health has taken a nosedive. I have severe anxiety and bipolar disorder and feel like I should just focus on my mental health/schoolwork before trying to get a job. But this means I have little money to spend on anything besides groceries. I’m having a rough situation with my flatmates and feel completely trapped when I’m back at my flat. I find myself just hanging out in my uni in order to not go back to my room. I feel like I’m slipping under and am having an extremely difficult time rising back up. 

It’s too cold here to spend time outside which is what I would normally do to help me cope when I feel down. Unfortunately a lot of other activities to occupy my time cost money. Back home when I’d feel down, I’d draw and paint. I also like to embroider but my embroidery hoop broke and the nearest art supply stores are not accessible by public transport. I don’t have money to take a taxi to an art supply store and art supplies themselves cost a lot of money. I feel like making art would make me beyond happy, but I simply can’t afford them right now. 

I’m not asking for expensive supplies. I honestly feel horrible for even asking. I’d just like something along the lines of paper, cheap colored pencils, glue, paint, crayons, an embroidery hoop, or something. Literally anything I’d be grateful for. Like I said I am in the UK. I would send you pictures of the art I created afterward and even though I am just an amateur, I’m open to the idea of creating something for you. I feel terrible asking for help but I don’t know what else to do. Thank you in advance."

,"[OFFER] menstrual products (tampons, pads, menstrual cup)","Hello y'all,

I was doing some thinking today and realised I am lucky enough that I never had to worry about buying menstrual products. And I got reminded that that is not true for everyone.

I would like to buy some for you. Either pads or tampons, or even a menstrual cup. I will not be able to afford a lot of them but I hope it can help someone in need ❤️

If in Europe, the easiest for me is to send by post. If anywhere else, let me know where to order.

Edit: if tampons or pads I can afford more but for cups I will only be able to send 2 I think. But I will make another post when I can afford more.

Edit 2: I am not able to buy more of those right now, but I will make another similar post in a few weeks when money comes in :)

Edit 3: really wanted to make another post in a bit of time but will not be able to afford it because of some money thing that came up. Also, this has been really draining emotionally. Glad I could help some people though."
